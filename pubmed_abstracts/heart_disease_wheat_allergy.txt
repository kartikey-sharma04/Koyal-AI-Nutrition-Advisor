Mycobacterium abscessus is one of the leading causes of pulmonary infections 
caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The ability of M. abscessus to establish 
a chronic infection in the lung relies on a series of adaptive mutations 
impacting, in part, global regulators and cell envelope biosynthetic enzymes. 
One of the genes under strong evolutionary pressure during host adaptation is 
ubiA, which participates in the elaboration of the arabinan domains of two major 
cell envelope polysaccharides: arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM). 
We here show that patient-derived UbiA mutations not only cause alterations in 
the AG, LAM, and mycolic acid contents of M. abscessus but also tend to render 
the bacterium more prone to forming biofilms while evading uptake by innate 
immune cells and enhancing their pro-inflammatory properties. The fact that the 
effects of UbiA mutations on the physiology and pathogenicity of M. abscessus 
were impacted by the rough or smooth morphotype of the strain suggests that the 
timing of their selection relative to morphotype switching may be key to their 
ability to promote chronic persistence in the host.IMPORTANCEMultidrug-resistant 
pulmonary infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus and subspecies are 
increasing in the U.S.A. and globally. Little is known of the mechanisms of 
pathogenicity of these microorganisms. We have identified single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene involved in the biosynthesis of two major cell 
envelope polysaccharides, arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan, in lung-adapted 
isolates from 13 patients. Introduction of these individual SNPs in a reference 
M. abscessus strain allowed us to study their impact on the physiology of the 
bacterium and its interactions with immune cells. The significance of our work 
is in identifying some of the mechanisms used by M. abscessus to colonize and 
persist in the human lung, which will facilitate the early detection of 
potentially more virulent clinical isolates and lead to new therapeutic 
strategies. Our findings may further have broader biomedical impacts, as the 
ubiA gene is conserved in other tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial 
pathogens.

BACKGROUND: The use of blood specific IgE or skin prick tests (SPT) to guide 
dietary exclusions for disease control in children with atopic dermatitis (AD) 
is controversial. We undertook a consensus exercise on how to interpret SPT 
results and dietary history for cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, and soy in 
children < 2 years old with AD.
METHODS: Fourteen clinicians from general practice, pediatrics, pediatric 
dermatology, pediatric allergy, and pediatric dietetics from UK and Ireland took 
part in an online modified Delphi study. Over three rounds, participants gave 
their anonymous opinions and received individualized and group feedback, based 
on the premise that all children had SPTs. The findings were discussed in an 
online workshop.
RESULTS: Of 18 symptoms, 12 were identified as relevant to immediate and 7 to 
delayed allergy. Regarding SPTs, there was consensus over which allergens to use 
for wheat and soy but not cow's milk or hen's egg; for all study foods, wheal 
size was determined as 0-1 mm negative, ≥ 5 mm sensitized, but between 2 and 
4 mm, categorization varied by food. During the final workshop, consensus was 
reached on dietary advice for nine combinations of SPT results and dietary 
history.
CONCLUSION: We attained consensus on how SPTs and dietary history for four 
common food allergens should be interpreted in young children under 2 years of 
age with AD. These pragmatic recommendations may support clinician education, 
consistency of decision-making, and future research.

The diagnostic decision point can help diagnose food allergies while reducing 
the need for oral food challenge (OFC) tests. We performed a multicenter survey 
of children aged 0-7 years from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2022. A total of 
231 children were recruited from 18 institutions. Wheat allergy (WA) or 
non-wheat allergy (NWA) was determined on the basis of OFC results and symptoms. 
There were no differences in age, sex, family history of allergy or allergic 
comorbidities between the WA and NWA groups. According to receiver operating 
characteristic analysis for wheat-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), the optimal 
cutoff value, positive decision point, and negative decision point were 10.2, 
33.5, and 0.41 kU/L, respectively. For the ω-5 gliadin-specific IgE, their 
values were 0.69, 3.88, and 0.01 kU/L, respectively. This new diagnostic 
decision point may be used to diagnose WA in Korean children.

The incidence and prevalence of food allergy (FA) is increasing. While several 
studies have established the safety and efficacy of early introduction of single 
allergens in infants for the prevention of FA, the exact dose, frequency, and 
number of allergens that can be safely introduced to infants, particularly in 
those at high or low risk of atopy, are still unclear. This 1-year pilot study 
evaluated the safety of the early introduction of single foods (milk, egg, or 
peanut) vs. two foods (milk/egg, egg/peanut, milk/peanut) vs. multiple foods 
(milk/egg/peanut/cashew/almond/shrimp/walnut/wheat/salmon/hazelnut at low, 
medium, or high doses) vs. no early introduction in 180 infants between 4-6 
months of age. At the end of the study, they were evaluated for plasma 
biomarkers associated with food reactivity via standardized blood tests. Two to 
four years after the start of the study, participants were evaluated by 
standardized food challenges. The serving sizes for the single, double, and low 
dose mixtures were 300 mg total protein per day. The serving sizes for the 
medium and high dose mixtures were 900 mg and 3000 mg total protein, 
respectively. Equal parts of each protein were used for double or mixture foods. 
All infants were breastfed until at least six months of age. The results 
demonstrate that infants at either high or low risk for atopy were able to 
tolerate the early introduction of multiple allergenic foods with no increases 
in any safety issues, including eczema, FA, or food protein induced 
enterocolitis. The mixtures of foods at either low, medium, or high doses 
demonstrated trends for improvement in food challenge reactivity and plasma 
biomarkers compared to single and double food introductions. The results of this 
study suggest that the early introduction of foods, particularly simultaneous 
mixtures of many allergenic foods, may be safe and efficacious for preventing FA 
and can occur safely. These results need to be confirmed by larger randomized 
controlled studies.

BACKGROUND: Previous reports suggested that food proteins present in human milk 
(HM) may trigger symptoms in allergic children during breastfeeding, but 
existing evidence has never been reviewed systematically.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the probability of food proteins in HM to trigger allergic 
reactions in infants with IgE-mediated food allergy.
METHODS: Electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE) were 
systematically searched from inception to November 3, 2021. The data regarding 
the levels of food proteins detected in HM were extracted and compared with data 
from the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL 3.0) guide to 
assess the probability of food-allergic individuals to experience immediate type 
allergic reactions on ingesting HM.
RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were identified. Fourteen studies assessed 
excretion of cow's milk proteins into HM, 9 egg, 4 peanut, and 2 wheat; 3 
measured levels of cow's milk and egg proteins simultaneously. We found that 
levels of all food proteins across the studies were much lower than the 
eliciting dose for 1% of allergic individuals (ED01) in most of the samples. The 
probability of an IgE-mediated allergic reaction in a food-allergic infant 
breastfed by a woman consuming the relevant food can be estimated as ≤1:1000 for 
cow's milk, egg, peanut, and wheat.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses 
and summarizes evidence on food proteins in HM and potential for IgE-mediated 
allergic reactions. Our data suggest that the probability of IgE-mediated 
allergic reactions to food proteins in HM is low.

AIM: Herein, we present five children and adolescents with a final diagnosis of 
non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).
BACKGROUND: Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a condition characterized by 
gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms triggered by ingestion of 
gluten-containing compounds, e.g., wheat, rye, and barley, in subjects without 
celiac disease or wheat allergy.
METHODS: Demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, serum biomarkers 
and skin prick test were evaluated. Patient data was also recorded after they 
followed a gluten-free diet (GFD). Height and weight were measured, and all 
patients were examined 6 months after following the suggested GFD.
RESULTS: All patients had failure to thrive and abdominal pain. Clinical 
symptoms were reduced, and significant weight and height gains were detected 
after 1 month of following a gluten-free diet.
CONCLUSION: The relationship between failure to thrive (FTT) and NCGS is still 
unknown; hence, NCGS may be one of the main causes of FTT which can be prevented 
by gluten-free diets.

The prevalence of food allergy has increased in recent years, especially in 
children. Allergen avoidance, and drugs in case of an allergic reaction, remains 
the standard of care in food allergy. Nevertheless, increasing attention has 
been given to the possibility to treat food allergy, through immunotherapy, 
particularly oral immunotherapy (OIT). Several OIT protocols and clinical trials 
have been published. Most of them focus on children allergic to milk, egg, or 
peanut, although recent studies developed protocols for other foods, such as 
wheat and different nuts. OIT efficacy in randomized controlled trials is 
usually evaluated as the possibility for patients to achieve desensitization 
through the consumption of an increasing amount of a food allergen, while the 
issue of a possible long-term sustained unresponsiveness has not been completely 
addressed. Here, we evaluated current pediatric OIT knowledge, focusing on the 
results of clinical trials and current guidelines. Specifically, we wanted to 
highlight what is known in terms of OIT efficacy and effectiveness, safety, and 
impact on quality of life. For each aspect, we reported the pros and the cons, 
inferable from published literature. In conclusion, even though many protocols, 
reviews and meta-analysis have been published on this topic, pediatric OIT 
remains a controversial therapy and no definitive generalized conclusion may be 
drawn so far. It should be an option provided by specialized teams, when both 
patients and their families are prone to adhere to the proposed protocol. 
Efficacy, long-term effectiveness, possible role of adjuvant therapies, risk of 
severe reactions including anaphylaxis or eosinophilic esophagitis, and impact 
on the quality of life of both children and caregivers are all aspects that 
should be discussed before starting OIT. Future studies are needed to provide 
firm clinical and scientific evidence, which should also consider patient 
reported outcomes.

Food hypersensitivity (FHS) refers to food-related symptoms, with or without 
concurrent Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies related to food(s). It remains 
unclear how different FHS phenotypes affect health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL). We examined self-reported HRQoL (with the generic instrument EQ-5D 
(dimensions and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), range 0-100) in association with 
phenotypes of FHS, and food-specific symptoms among adolescents (n = 2990) from 
a population-based birth cohort. Overall, 22% of the adolescents had FHS. 
Compared to adolescents without FHS, those with FHS reported more problems in 
the dimensions of pain/discomfort (p < 0.001), and anxiety/depression (p = 
0.007). Females with FHS reported more problems than males in these dimensions 
(p < 0.001). Different FHS phenotypes (IgE-sensitization, allergic co-morbidity, 
and severity of symptoms) were not associated with differences in HRQoL. EQ-VAS 
scores were lowest for adolescents with symptoms for wheat vs. no wheat, median 
80 vs. 89, p = 0.04) and milk vs. no milk (median 85 vs. 90, p = 0.03). 
Physician-diagnosed lactose intolerance median EQ-VAS was 80 vs. 90, p = 0.03 
and also associated with more problems in the dimension of anxious/depression. 
In conclusion, FHS is associated with lower HRQoL in adolescence, irrespective 
of phenotypes, but differentially affects females vs. males, and those with vs. 
without symptoms for milk or wheat.

BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis is increasing in young children. The aim of the present 
study was to analyze the clinical characteristics of anaphylaxis in Korean 
infants, with a focus on food triggers.
METHODS: The study analyzed the medical records of infants aged 0 to 2 years old 
who had been diagnosed with anaphylaxis in 23 secondary or tertiary hospitals in 
Korea.
RESULTS: We identified 363 cases of infantile anaphylaxis (66.9% male). 
Cutaneous symptoms were most prevalent (98.6%), followed by respiratory (83.2%), 
gastrointestinal (29.8%), and neurologic (11.6%) symptoms. Cardiovascular 
symptoms were noted in 7.7% of the cases. Most of the cases of anaphylaxis (338; 
93.1%) were induced by foods. The most common trigger food was cow's milk and 
cow's milk products (43.8%), followed by hen's eggs (21.9%), walnuts (8.3%), 
wheat (7.7%), peanuts (4.8%), other nuts (3.0%), and fish (2.1%). In cow's 
milk-induced anaphylaxis cases, more than half the cases had cow's milk specific 
immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels that were lower than the diagnostic decision 
points (DDPs), which is 5 kUA/L for those under the age of 1 and 15 kUA/L for 
those over the age of 1. In anaphylaxis induced by hen's egg, most of the cases 
(91.8%) had hen's egg sIgE levels that were higher than the DDP, which is 2 
kUA/L for those under the age of 2 and 7 kUA/L for those over the age of 2. Of 
the infantile anaphylaxis cases, 46.8% had been treated with epinephrine, and 
25.1% had been prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector.
CONCLUSION: Cow's milk is the most frequent trigger food of anaphylaxis in 
Korean infants. However, we found no significant correlation between the sIgE 
level and clinical severity. Education is required regarding the importance of 
epinephrine as the first line therapy for anaphylaxis and on properly 
prescribing epinephrine for infants with a history of anaphylaxis.

BACKGROUND: Allergic transfusion reactions (ATRs) present with a broad range of 
symptoms probably caused by mediators released from mast cells and basophil 
granulocytes upon activation. Passive immunoglobulin (Ig)E sensitization may 
yield clinical symptoms and positive allergy tests. Unexpected findings of IgE 
antibodies in pooled solvent/detergent (S/D)-treated plasma (Octaplas, 
Octapharma) during routine analysis initiated an investigation of serum 
proteins.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Consecutive batches of S/D-plasma transfused during 
September 2014 through March 2015 were investigated for IgE, IgG, IgA IgM, C3, 
C4, haptoglobin, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), and red blood cell (RBC) 
antibodies.
RESULTS: During the study period, 4203 S/D-plasma units were transfused. 
Nineteen (14 Octaplas A and five Octaplas AB) of 20 batches of S/D-plasma were 
included, representing 99.9% of total number of plasma units. A total of 0.4% of 
units and five batches reported ATRs. Concentrations of total IgE higher than 
expected values in adults (<120 kU/L) were observed in 18 of the 19 (95%) 
batches investigated (median concentration [quartiles], 161 [133-183]). Specific 
IgE antibodies (expected < 0.35 kilounits antigen [kUA]/L) against house dust 
mite (2.52 [1.01-5.09]), timothy (2.83 [2.48-3.24]), cat (1.13 [0.58-1.52]), dog 
(0.83 [0.50-1.05]), mugwort (0.69 [0.53-0.97]), birch (0.62 [0.28-0.92]), peanut 
(0.52 [0.29-075]), wheat (0.46 [0.33-0.69]), and latex (0.32 [0.21-0.53]) were 
also detected. IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4, and haptoglobin were within or below 
normal ranges. No RBC antibodies were observed, but 18% of batches showed low 
levels of ANA (anti-RNP).
CONCLUSION: Specific IgE antibodies against airborne allergens, food allergens, 
and latex were detected in S/D-treated pooled plasma.

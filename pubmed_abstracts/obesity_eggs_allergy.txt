In Europe, organic food must comply with specific regulations which do not 
include nutritional criteria. The ability of organic food to meet the 
nutritional needs of children is not assessed. This narrative review discusses 
the nutritional composition (macronutrients, micronutrients) of organic food 
compared with conventional products and its clinical relevance with a paediatric 
focus, as well as the health impact of these differences and of contaminants 
which interfere with metabolism. Other potential differences, particularly 
regarding the direct/indirect exposure to other contaminants in conventional 
food, are not addressed in this review. The composition of some organic food may 
differ from conventional food. Protein content was lower in cereals and eggs. A 
lower n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) ratio was observed in milk, meat and 
eggs. Long-chain PUFA and vitamin E may be higher in milk, meat and fish, as 
well as some minerals and antioxidants (phenolic compounds, vitamin C) in 
fruits, vegetables and starchy food and carotenoids in fruits and vegetables. 
Epidemiological studies suggest an association between organic diets and lower 
prevalence of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, whereas 
the protective effect on allergy and cancer is controversial. Some organic food 
may be of greater nutritional interest for children's diet than conventional 
food. Standardised studies comparing food composition and diet in children are 
needed. Considering the lower toxicologic risk and the sustainability of organic 
food, the Committee on Nutrition encourages the use of organic food, provided 
that such food is affordable, alongside specific baby food which is subject to 
strict specific European Union regulations.

BACKGROUND: Adoption of allergen avoidance diets may increase the risk of 
nutritional deficiencies and affect growth in children with food allergy (FA). 
How these dietary restrictions have an impact on diet diversity, a 
health-promoting eating behavior, remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diet diversity, dietary intake, and weight status of 
children with FA.
DESIGN: Observational study.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One hundred children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated 
milk, egg, or nut FA or multiple FAs and 60 children with perennial respiratory 
allergies (RA) matched as controls, aged 3 to 18 years, were consecutively 
recruited into the study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intake and diet diversity (number of different 
foods consumed/day) were assessed through 4 24-hour recalls. Weight status 
(underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity) was also evaluated.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Chi-squared test and 2-sample independent t test 
were used to test differences between groups. Adjustment for sex, age, and 
energy intake was made using linear regression.
RESULTS: The percentage of underweight was higher in children with FA (19.6%) 
compared with children in the control group (5.1%). Children with FA compared 
with children in the control group consumed more servings of meat (1.7, 95% CI, 
1.6, 1.9 vs. 1.5, 95% CI, 1.3, 1.7 servings/day [Padj = 0.031]). No difference 
was observed in the diet diversity between the 2 groups (11-12 different 
foods/day). Within the FA group, children with allergy to milk proteins had 
lower energy intake from protein, lower intake of calcium, lower consumption of 
commercially prepared sweets, and higher consumption of eggs, compared with 
children with nut or egg allergy, but no difference in diet diversity was 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet diversity did not differ between children with FA and children 
with no FA, despite some differences in the intake from specific food groups. 
However, the higher percentage of underweight in children with FA suggests the 
need for targeted nutrition intervention as early as possible after FA 
diagnosis.

With a variety of symptoms that can impede children's development, food 
allergies are an important public health concern. With the help of information 
from the King Fahad Medical City Hospital in Riyadh, we looked at how 
restricting certain foods affected the growth of Saudi children who had food 
allergies. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire asking about the 
individuals' demographics and their restricted eating habits was completed by 72 
children (48 boys and 24 girls) between the ages of 2 and 14. The sensitivity of 
six allergens (hen eggs, cow milk, fish, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans), 
anthropometric indices, specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and sensitivity 
were examined. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), version 26, 
was used to analyze the data. Chi-square and t-tests were used to examine the 
relationships between various category variables. According to the findings, 
most of the mothers of the children were between the ages of 30 and 40 (80.6%), 
had a college degree (72.3%), were unemployed (59.7%), and had a monthly family 
income between 5000 and 15,000 SAR (69.4%). Both sexes had specific IgE 
antibodies for allergens in classes 2 and 3, with boys having noticeably (p ≤ 
0.05) higher quantities than girls. While females were more sensitive to fish 
and peanuts, boys were more likely than girls to show specific IgE sensitivity 
to egg white, cow milk, wheat, and soybeans. Both sexes' allergy levels were 
considerably (p ≤ 0.01) higher in children aged 5.01 to 10 than in other age 
groups. In terms of classifications of thinness, overweightness, and obesity, 
boys were slenderer than girls, and a greater percentage of boys than girls were 
overweight or obese. The exclusion of hen eggs, cow milk, wheat, and peanuts 
from the diet had a significant and detrimental effect on body mass index (BMI) 
and height-for-age ratio among children with impaired growth, in contrast to the 
demographic factors, which had a significant and favorable effect on the growth 
of other children. In conclusion, restrictions on food allergens impairs growth 
in Saudi children, particularly boys' growth.

Eggs: Healthy or Risky? A Review of Evidence from High Quality Studies on Hen's 
Eggs.

Hen's eggs (from Gallus gallus domesticus) provide choline, folate, vitamin D, 
iodine, B vitamins and high-quality protein and are no longer viewed by national 
bodies as a risk factor for hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Yet, questions remain about the benefits and risks of eating eggs 
regularly. This review evaluates recent high-quality evidence from randomised 
controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses of observational studies and considers 
new areas of interest, such as weight management, protein metabolism, allergy 
risk and sustainability. In several RCT, eggs increased muscle protein synthesis 
and lowered fat mass, which could support optimal body composition. Eggs within 
a meal improved satiety, which could translate into lower energy intakes, 
although more RCT are needed. In observational studies, higher egg consumption 
was associated with a null effect or a modest reduced risk of CVD. For type 2 
diabetes (T2D) incidence and risk of CVD in people with T2D, there were 
inconsistencies between observational and RCT data, with the former noting 
positive associations and the latter seeing no effect of higher egg intake on 
markers of T2D and CVD. Sustainability metrics suggest that eggs have the lowest 
planetary impact amongst animal proteins. To lower allergy risk, earlier 
introduction of eggs into weaning diets is warranted. In conclusion, the balance 
of evidence points to eggs being a nutritious food suggesting there are broad 
health benefits from including eggs in the diet at intakes higher than that 
currently consumed by European populations.

BACKGROUND: Omega-3 supplementation has been reported to modulate immune 
responses and prevent food allergies among children; however, findings are 
inconsistent, and the timing of supplementation, which is critical, has not been 
thoroughly investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To assess optimal timing (maternal vs childhood intake) of omega-3 
supplementation for reducing food allergy risk among children in 2 periods (the 
first 3 years and beyond 3 years of age).
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effects of maternal or 
childhood omega-3 supplementation on preventing the development of infant food 
allergies and food sensitizations. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web 
of Science databases were searched for related studies published until October 
30, 2022. We conducted dose-response and subgroup analyses to investigate the 
effects of omega-3 supplementation.
RESULTS: We found that maternal omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy and 
lactation was significantly associated with decreased risks of infant egg 
sensitization (relative risk [RR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 
0.47-0.73, P < .01) and peanut sensitization (RR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80, P < 
.01) among children. Similar results were found in subgroup analyses for food 
allergy, egg sensitization, and peanut sensitization during the first 3 years of 
age and peanut sensitization and cashew nut sensitization beyond 3 years of age. 
Dose-response analysis showed a linear relationship between maternal omega-3 
supplementation and infant egg sensitization risk during early life. By 
contrast, intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid during childhood did not 
appear to significantly protect against food allergies.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy and lactation, 
rather than childhood intake, reduces the risk of infant food allergy and food 
sensitization.

BACKGROUND: Egg consumption may play an important role in early-life growth 
given their high-quality protein, essential fatty acids, and micronutrients.
OBJECTIVES: Study objectives were to examine the longitudinal associations of 
infant age at egg introduction with obesity outcomes in early childhood, middle 
childhood (mid-childhood), and early adolescence.
METHODS: We used existing data from 1089 mother-child dyads from Project Viva to 
estimate age at egg introduction through a questionnaire completed by mothers at 
∼1 y postpartum (mean ± SD, 13.3 ± 1.2 mo). Outcome measures included height and 
weight (early childhood, mid-childhood, and early adolescence), body composition 
including total fat mass, trunk fat mass, and lean mass (mid-childhood and early 
adolescence), and plasma adiponectin and leptin (early and mid-childhood and 
early adolescence). We defined childhood obesity as sex- and age-specific BMI ≥ 
95th percentile. We estimated the associations of infant age at egg introduction 
with risk of obesity using multivariable logistic regression and multivariable 
linear regression models for BMI-z-score, body composition measures, and 
adiposity hormones; adjusted for maternal prepregnancy BMI and 
sociodemographics.
RESULTS: Among females, those introduced to egg by the 1-y survey had a lower 
total fat mass index (confounder-adjusted mean difference, -1.23 kg/m2; 95% CI: 
-2.14, -0.31), and trunk fat mass index (confounder-adjusted mean difference, 
-0.57 kg/m2; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.12) in early adolescence compared to those not 
introduced (reference group). However, no associations between infant age at egg 
introduction and risk of obesity were observed among males (confounder-adjusted 
odd ratio [aOR], 1.97; 95% CI: 0.90, 4.30) or females (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.38, 
1.24) across all ages. Egg introduction in infancy was associated with lower 
plasma adiponectin among females (confounder-adjusted mean difference, -1.93 
μg/mL; 95% CI: -3.70, -0.16) in early childhood only.
CONCLUSIONS: Egg introduction during infancy among females is associated with 
lower total fat mass index in early adolescence and plasma adiponectin in early 
childhood. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02820402.

BACKGROUND: Multiple systematic reviews examine the introduction of foods in 
relation to individual health outcomes, but the balance of harms and benefits 
has not been overviewed systematically.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to perform an overview of systematic reviews on age of 
introduction of complementary and allergenic foods to the infant diet and long 
and short-term health outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed (July 25, 2022).
STUDY SELECTION: Included systematic reviews examining the introduction of 
complementary or allergenic foods before age 1. Outcomes included allergic, 
autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, neurodevelopment, nutrition, and weight.
DATA EXTRACTION: Extraction and quality assessment were performed in duplicate 
(A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and strength of evidence was 
assessed.
RESULTS: We screened 4015 articles and included 32 systematic reviews. There was 
moderate evidence that peanut and egg should be introduced from 4 to 11 months 
to prevent food allergy (6 of 10 reviews). Complementary food introduction was 
not associated with food allergy. Moderate certainty evidence suggested age of 
complementary food introduction was not associated with eczema. Age at 
introduction of gluten was not associated with celiac disease (high certainty 
evidence; 3 of 4 reviews). Low certainty evidence indicated that introducing 
solids before 4 months may increase the risk of childhood obesity, but not 
growth. There was insufficient evidence regarding an association between any 
food introduction and bone health, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune 
disorders, asthma, or allergic rhinitis.
LIMITATIONS: Gray literature was not included.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports introducing complementary foods around 6 
months and allergenic foods before 11 months.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of self-reported food 
allergy among university students in China. A cluster-random sampling 
population-based cross-sectional study using self - administrated questionnaire 
was conducted with 2538 college students recruited from 6 universities in China. 
The questionnaire included data on age, sex, weight, height, FA, comorbid 
allergic diseases, family history, and understanding food allergy. Data were 
analyzed by SPSS 25.0 statistical software. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis was performed to analyze the risk factors related to self-reported food 
allergy and estimate the odds ratio. A total of 2538 questionnaires were 
distributed to the undergraduate students and 2313 completely effective 
questionnaires were collected, the effective response rate was 91.1%. 834 males 
and 1479 females were recruited, and their age ranged from 18 to 25 years old. 
The prevalence of self-reported food allergy was 15.7%, and the rate of 
doctor-diagnosed food allergy was 8.4%. The leading food allergens included 
shrimp, shellfish, milk, egg, peach, mango, beef, and peanut, and the prevalence 
of shrimp allergy was the highest (5.8%). The main clinical manifestation 
included skin mucous membrane and respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of food 
allergy were statistically significant difference (P < .05) between different 
age groups, family history, sun exposure times, smoking, and antibiotic use. 
Over 45% college students know little about food allergy. The prevalence of 
self-reported food allergy among Chinese college students was high (15.7%). 
Shrimp was the main allergenic food, followed by shellfish, milk, egg, peach, 
and mango. Family history, sun exposure, obesity, and using antibiotics may be 
the influencing factors of food allergy. The Chinese undergraduates lacked the 
knowledge about food allergy. Thus, it is necessary to strengthen the health 
education program on food allergy for college students in China and other middle 
high-income nations.

To evaluate the relationship between infant age of egg introduction and 
malnutrition-related growth outcomes in the United States, we analysed secondary 
data of 1716 mother-child dyads in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II and its 
Year 6 Follow-Up Study. Malnutrition-related growth outcomes included body mass 
index z-score (BMIZ), obesity (weight-for-height z-score [WHZ] ≥3 or BMIZ ≥ 2), 
WHZ, wasting (WHZ < -2), height-for-age z-score (HAZ), and stunting (HAZ < -2). 
Infant age at egg introduction was analysed as a continuous variable. We used 
generalised estimating equations to estimate the mean difference in continuous 
outcomes and relative risk [RR]) for binary outcomes, adjusting for related 
maternal and child confounders. We also explored interactions with child sex, 
maternal race/ethnicity, maternal educational level, ever breastfeeding, and 
formula feeding. In the total sample, a later infant age at egg introduction was 
associated with a lower mean difference in HAZ (confounder-adjusted mean 
difference = -0.08, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.12 to -0.03 per month) and 
a higher risk of stunting (confounder-adjusted RR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03-1.33 per 
month) at 6 years. The associations between infant age at egg introduction and 
12-month growth outcomes differed by child sex. Among females but not among 
males, later introduction of eggs was associated with a lower mean WHZ (-0.06 
[-0.12 to 0.00] per month) at 12 months. Later egg introduction during infancy 
was associated with a lower mean HAZ and a higher risk of stunting in 6-year-old 
children. Besides this, it was associated with a lower WHZ among females at 12 
months.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy prevalence data have largely been derived from 
self-report, and estimates vary.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of physician-reported food allergy in 
children using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care 
Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPSSN).
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the CPCSSN repository, 
Canada's only primary care practice-based surveillance system. Machine learning 
algorithms were applied to assess for food allergy documentation. Demographic 
information, chronic diseases of interest, prescribed medications, and health 
behaviors from the CPCSSN repository were identified.
RESULTS: The prevalence of physician-reported food allergy in Canadian children 
was 2.53% (95% CI, 2.48%-2.59%). The most common food allergies documented were 
peanut (0.8% of children), tree nut (0.6%), cow's milk (0.4%), egg (0.3%), fruit 
(0.2%), finned fish (0.2%), and shellfish (0.2%). Among children with food 
allergy, only 33.7% had an epinephrine autoinjector prescription. In logistic 
regression analysis, children with food allergy were more likely to have an 
atopic comorbidity (odds ratio [OR], 2.20; 95% CI, 2.06-2.35) and less likely to 
be obese than children without food allergies (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). In 
the age- and sex-adjusted models, patients with food allergy were significantly 
more likely to have a psychiatric morbidity, specifically: attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.66-1.96), autism (OR, 1.89; 
95% CI, 1.63-2.19), and depression (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to estimate national physician-reported 
prevalence of food allergy, and demonstrates a lower rate than that based on 
self-report. Further studies into the association of food allergy and 
psychiatric comorbidities (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, 
depression) and the association of food allergy and obesity are needed.

BACKGROUND: Seafood allergy (SA), including allergy to shellfish (crustacean and 
mollusks) and fish, is among the 4 most common food allergies causing 
anaphylaxis, but there are limited data showing SA clinical management in 
different countries.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize a large cohort of patients with fish and 
shellfish allergy and to facilitate standardization of future care for this 
increasingly common allergic disease.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational, noninterventional study 
from 945 patients from 2015 to 2019 in 7 hospitals in the United States and the 
United Kingdom to evaluate SA. A chi-square test was used to detect differences 
in family history, medical history, and current symptoms between patients in 2 
countries.
RESULTS: Underdiagnosed anaphylaxis in patients with SA was associated with 
underuse of epinephrine (adrenaline) autoinjectors in both countries. Oral food 
challenge was used only when skin or serologic test results were negative. 
Asthma and allergic rhinitis were more common in the US patients with SA, but 
eczema was more common in UK patients with SA (P < .001). Respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms were higher in UK patients with SA 
than in US patients with SA (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In international multicenter cohorts of patients with fish and 
shellfish allergy, there are opportunities for improvement in management. 
Physician identification of anaphylaxis, use of diagnostic oral food challenges, 
and anaphylaxis treatment with epinephrine are areas with significant knowledge 
gaps in need of improvement in the United Kingdom and the United States. There 
is an opportunity for the development of unified, standardized diagnostic 
protocols for SA with distribution for allergists and trainees.

In the United States, approximately 2% to 3% of adults and 8% of children have a 
food allergy. Allergic reactions range from minor pruritus to life-threatening 
anaphylaxis. These allergies often lead to significant anxiety and costs for 
patients and caregivers. Common food allergies include peanuts, cow's milk, 
shellfish, tree nuts, egg, fish, soy, and wheat. Peanut allergy, the most 
common, is the leading cause of life-threatening anaphylaxis. Children with 
asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or an allergy to insect venom, 
medications, or latex are at an increased risk of developing food allergies. 
Diagnosis of food allergy starts with a detailed, allergy-focused history. Serum 
immunoglobulin E and skin prick testing provide reliable information regarding 
food allergy diagnoses. Primary treatment involves elimination of the offending 
food from the diet. Prevention strategies proven to decrease the risk of 
developing a food allergy include restricting exposure to cow's milk in the 
first three days of life and early sequential exposure to allergenic foods 
starting between four and six months of age. Exclusive breastfeeding for three 
to four months reduces the likelihood of developing eczema and asthma but does 
not reduce development of food allergies. Most children eventually outgrow 
allergies to cow's milk, egg, soy, and wheat. However, allergies to tree nuts, 
peanuts, and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that the timing of introduction of 
potentially allergenic food is crucial for the development of food allergy in 
children. This cross-sectional study aimed to clarify the reality of allergen 
food intake in a general population of young children in Japan.
METHODS: A questionnaire survey of caregivers was conducted at health checkups 
for 1.5-year (18-month)-old and 3-year-old children in the fall of 2020. The 
caregivers were asked about (1) the presence/absence of allergic disease 
symptoms based on the ISAAC questionnaire, and (2) foods that caregivers avoided 
giving their children. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were periformed to 
determine factors associated with food avoidance.
RESULTS: Questionnaires were distributed to 1720 caregivers, and 1603 (93%) 
responded. The responders consisted of 771 and 832 caregivers who participated 
in 1.5-year-old and 3-year-old checkups, respectively. The prevalence of 
allergic diseases was comparable to recent epidemiological studies in Japan, 
indicating that the population may be representative. At 1.5 years old, more 
than 50% of the children were not exposed to peanuts, tree nuts, fish eggs, 
shellfish, and buckwheat. At 3 years old, the avoidance rates of the foods had 
decreased but were still between 18.8% and 32.0%. On the other hand, the 
avoidance rates of chicken egg and cow's milk, the top 2 common allergenic foods 
in Japan, were much lower at 2.8% and 1.5% at 1.5 years, and they decreased to 
1.4% and 0.7% at 3 years old, respectively. Ordinal logistic analysis showed 
that avoidance of chicken egg, cow's milk, and wheat was associated with food 
allergy diagnosis and chicken egg avoidance with eczema, but avoidance of other 
foods showed no associations with any risk factors for food allergy.
CONCLUSION: Caregivers avoided giving various foods, independent of allergy risk 
factors, to their young children. Since delayed introduction of an allergenic 
food has been reported to increase the risk of developing an allergy to the 
food, the results warrant future investigation of the development of food 
allergies in relation to current eating habits and recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Early introduction of allergenic foods is recommended to reduce the 
risk of developing food allergies, but it is unclear whether recommendations are 
being followed.
OBJECTIVE: We examine patterns of allergenic food introduction in inner-city 
children enrolled in an academic pediatric practice in the greater Los Angeles 
area.
METHODS: This was a prospective study with patients ages 12 to 24 months 
recruited from the pediatrics continuity clinic at an inner-city tertiary 
medical center in the greater Los Angeles area. Caregivers were asked via 
anonymous surveys about their child's history of atopic diseases and at what age 
they first introduced egg, soy, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shrimp, and 
shellfish into their child's diet.
RESULTS: Two hundred caregivers responded to the survey. The average age of 
introduction of egg was 9.2 months, soy 10 months, wheat 9.3 months, peanut 10.5 
months, tree nuts 10.9 months, fish 10.9 months, shrimp 11.3 months, and 
shellfish 11.5 months. Between ages 4-11 months, 65.3% of children were 
introduced egg, 19.1% soy, 55.8% wheat, 28.6% peanut, 17.1% tree nuts, 28.1% 
fish, 13.6% shrimp, and 7.0% shellfish. By age 24 months, 92% of children were 
introduced egg, 37.7% soy, 85.4% wheat, 67.3% peanut, 47.7% tree nuts, 67.8% 
fish, 48.2% shrimp, and 30.2% shellfish. Of the 14 children with eczema or egg 
allergy, 26.1% were introduced peanut by age 4-6 months and 50% by age 4-11 
months.
CONCLUSION: Despite recommendations, inner-city caregivers may not be 
introducing allergenic foods in a timely manner to their children.

Shellfish consumption and health: A comprehensive review of human studies and 
recommendations for enhanced public policy.

Shellfish, including various species of mollusks (e.g., clams, oysters, and 
mussels) and crustaceans (e.g., shrimp and crab), have been a cornerstone of 
healthy dietary recommendations. However, beyond providing basic nutrition 
needs, their health-promoting effects have been suggested to include 
inflammation reduction and prevention of various chronic 
non-communicable diseases. Currently, studies on the association between 
shellfish consumption and health outcomes have reported conflicting results. The 
present comprehensive review summarized the latest studies on shellfish 
consumption and synthesized the available evidence on the potential health 
benefits or risks of shellfish consumption. The findings demonstrated that 
shellfish consumption may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout but may 
not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and thyroid 
cancer. Adequate evidence is lacking on the association between shellfish 
consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral cancer, 
endometriosis, hip fracture, cognitive function, wheeze, eczema and food 
allergy. Raw shellfish consumption may cause gastroenteritis and other diseases 
infected by bacteria or viruses. This review thus provides consumers and other 
relevant stakeholders with the latest evidence-based information on the 
potential benefits and risks of shellfish consumption.

Royal jelly (RJ), a creamy substance secreted by honeybees, is the exclusive 
diet for queen bee differentiation and life maintenance. RJ has been used in 
cosmetics, beverages, medicines, and supplements worldwide. However, allergy is 
a concerning issue for RJ, especially in atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma 
patients. In some cases, allergic reactions are seen after the first intake of 
RJ, suggesting the existence of allergens cross-reactive with RJ. Information 
about the cross-reactive allergens is very important for the safe application of 
RJ; however, study of this cross-reactivity is quite limited. In this study, we 
attempted to identify allergens cross-reactive with RJ by using serum samples 
from 30 AD patients who had never been exposed to RJ. In an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiment, RJ-binding IgE antibodies were detected 
in the serum of 10 out of 30 patients, and their antibody titers ranged from 4- 
to 2,048-fold dilution ratios. Additionally, 3 AD patients were determined to be 
positive in a skin-prick test (SPT) with an RJ solution. Significant 
correlations were observed between the anti-RJ antibody titer and nonspecific 
IgE and between the anti-RJ antibody titer and the Eczema Area and Severity 
Index score. We further examined the cross-reactivity between RJ and 14 typical 
allergens by using an ELISA-inhibition assay and demonstrated that the following 
6 allergens showed cross-reactivity with RJ: the European house dust mite (HDM) 
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), American HDM (Dermatophagoides farinae), snow 
crab (Chionocetes spp.), edible crab (Cancer pagurus), German cockroach 
(Blatella germanica), and honeybee venom (Apis mellifera). In conclusion, people 
with a history of allergic diseases, including AD, asthma, and allergic 
rhinitis, should be cautioned against consuming RJ products because of the 
potential for cross-reactive responses to ensure the safe and successful use of 
RJ supplements.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review article is to discuss the recent 
literature around methods of prevention of food allergies other than peanut 
allergy.
RECENT FINDINGS: While the most robust data to date exists for peanut, there are 
emerging studies suggesting a beneficial effect to early introduction of cooked 
egg, and cow's milk as well. While the literature is sparse for other allergens 
such as tree nuts, finned fish, and shellfish, the mechanism of sensitization is 
thought to be the same and no study to date has demonstrated a harm with 
allergenic introduction in the 4-6 months of age window (nor has there been 
level 1 evidence of benefit to delay of such allergens). This strategy is safe, 
and pre-emptive testing is not required prior to allergenic solid introduction. 
All allergenic solids should be introduced at around 6, but not before 4, months 
of age in infants at high risk.

BACKGROUND: Multiple factors affect growth in children with atopic dermatitis 
(AD). We investigated food restriction practice, nutrition, and growth in 
children with AD. Food restriction is defined as restriction ≥3 types of food 
due to AD or food allergy.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in 150 children aged 
12-36 months.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: recurrent infections, moderate to severe asthma, recent 
systemic steroid, other diseases affecting growth/nutrition. Growth parameters, 
SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, potassium, 
albumin, protein, calcium, phosphate, B12, iron, and folate values were 
determined. Parents completed a 3-day food diary.
RESULTS: The prevalence of food restriction was 60.7%. Commonly restricted foods 
were shellfish 62.7%, nuts 53.3%, egg 50%, dairy 29.3%, and cow's milk 28.7%. 
Food-restricted children have significantly lower calorie, protein, fat, 
riboflavin, vitamin B12, calcium, phosphorus and iron intakes and lower serum 
iron, protein and albumin values. Z scores of weight-for-age (-1.38 ± 1.02 vs 
-0.59 ± 0.96, P = .00), height-for-age (-1.34 ± 1.36 vs -0.51 ± 1.22, P = .00), 
head circumference-for-age (-1.37 ± 0.90 vs -0.90 ± 0.81, P = .00), mid-upper 
arm circumference (MUAC)-for-age (-0.71 ± 0.90 vs -0.22 ± 0.88, P = .00), and 
BMI-for-age (-0.79 ± 1.15 vs -0.42 ± 0.99, P = .04) were significantly lower in 
food-restricted compared to non-food-restricted children. More food-restricted 
children were stunted, underweight with lower head circumference and MUAC. 
Severe disease was an independent risk factor for food restriction with OR 
5.352; 95% CI, 2.26-12.68.
CONCLUSION: Food restriction is common in children with AD. It is associated 
with lower Z scores for weight, height, head circumference, MUAC, and BMI. 
Severe disease is an independent risk factor for food restriction.

Objective:To investigate the prevalence and state of allergic rhinitis, asthma, 
eczema, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergy of students in primary and 
middle schools of Foshan, and to analyze the characteristics of each disease and 
correlation of the five diseases, in order to provide epidemiology evidence for 
management of allergic diseases. Method:Ten primary schools and 10 junior middle 
schools were sampled from 5 districts of Foshan, then students in grade one and 
grade seven from sampled schools were investigated by electronic questionnaire 
method formulated by the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
Childhood and the Europrevall Project Commission. Students and their parents 
answered and uploaded electronic questionnaires with the consent of parents, and 
then team members collected and analyzed uploaded data. Result:Four thousand one 
hundred and sixty-six effective questionnaires were collected, and the response 
rate was 95.77％. During the five districts, 13.97%, 2.01%, 29.29%, 5.19%, and 
7.28% of the respondents in grade one had previously diagnosed with allergic 
rhinitis, asthma, eczema, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergy 
respectively, and the correspondent rates in grade seven were 15.99%, 2.89%, 
16.73%, 2.46%, and 6.97%. The prevalence rates of the five diseases in boys were 
higher than that in girls in both two grades. 67.27% students with asthma kept 
coughing and wheezing in the last 12 months, and 24.85% non-asthma students had 
the same respiratory symptoms. The most common allergenic food were shrimp and 
crabs, followed by milk and milk products, eggs, and shellfish. Cutaneous 
symptoms and oral allergy symptoms were predominant clinical manifestations in 
all students with food allergy. The prevalence of the above allergic diseases of 
children with atopic family history was higher than that of children without 
family history, and the prevalence of the 5 diseases of children living in city 
was higher than that of children living in rural areas. The prevalence rate of 
asthma of children with allergic rhinitis in both grades was higher than that of 
children without allergic rhinitis, and the same happened to children with 
eczema, allergic conjunctivitis, and food allergy. Conclusion:Prevalence rates 
of allergic rhinitis and asthma in primary and middle school students of Foshan 
increased as children grew, while the prevalence rates of eczema, allergic 
conjunctivitis and food allergy decreased with age. The most common allergenic 
food were shrimp and crabs, milk and milk products, and eggs. 67.27% students 
with asthma had poor respiratory control in the last 12 months. The prevalence 
of allergic diseases of children living in city and with atopic family history 
was higher than that of children living in rural areas and without family 
history. Students with allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy, allergic rhinitis 
and eczema had high risk of asthma.

Sporidesmin, a toxin released by a saprophytic fungus, Pseudopithomyces 
chartarum, causes hepatogenous photosensitivity in sheep and cattle, commonly 
known as Facial Eczema. A recent outbreak in the Eastern Cape Province of South 
Africa caused significant direct and indirect economic losses to a farmer in the 
area and highlighted the potential negative consequences of this mycotoxicosis 
to the dairy industry in this province. The milking herd consisted of 400 
cross-bred Jersey/Friesian/Montbilliard cattle. The farmer identified 56 cows 
showing teat sensitivity/irritability during milking, hypersensitive skin, 
excessive licking and/or obvious skin lesions on non-pigmented skin areas. Three 
were culled due to the severity of their skin lesions. Grazing consisted of 
mixed kikuyu/perennial rye grass pasture under pivot irrigation, alternated with 
dryland kikuyu/Italian rye and sorghum. Typical clinical signs of severe 
secondary photosensitivity (skin inflammation and hypersensitivity to touch), 
very high serum concentrations of Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT 2143-5177 
IU/L) and detection of large numbers of spores on grazed planted pastures 
supported the clinical diagnosis. Supplementation of zinc oxide (ZnO) powder at 
12g per 500 kg cow dosed individually over the concentrates fed in the dairy, 
effectively reduced the incidence of new cases within two to three weeks. Weight 
loss, a decrease in milk volume and solids, and increased somatic cell counts 
were observed during this outbreak. One of these parameters, milk volume loss, 
was quantified by comparing the financial records of the four years preceding 
the outbreak to the production figures during the outbreak. The farmer lost 
approximately R1.5 million in milk volume during this outbreak (November 2020 - 
April 2021). Long term consequences were also apparent: the culling rate within 
the clinically affected group of 53 cows was more than 50% higher than the rest 
of the herd over the following two years. This case study highlights the urgent 
need to investigate the prevalence and potential economic impact of Sporidesmin 
Toxicity on the South African pasture-based dairy industry.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Milk is an important source of dietary calcium and, if 
fortified, vitamin D. Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is treated with a milk 
elimination diet. Although most children become tolerant by age 3 years, some 
continue dairy avoidance. It remains unclear whether adolescents with a history 
of CMA adopt similar milk consumption as their peers. We assessed dairy 
consumption and concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in 
adolescents with either confirmed CMA or a negative CMA challenge in infancy 
(CMA-refuted group) and age-matched controls.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study is based on a previously reported randomized 
controlled trial from 1999 to 2002 on the treatment effect of probiotics on 
atopic eczema in participants aged <12 months (n = 230) with data on CMA status. 
We followed up these participants, aged 15-18 years, in 2017 (n = 104). A 
20-item food frequency questionnaire assessed dairy consumption. An automated 
immunoassay measured 25(OH)D concentration.
RESULTS: Median dairy product consumption did not differ between adolescents 
with CMA (449 g/d, n = 40), the CMA-refuted group (566 g/d, n = 36), and 
controls (235 g/d, n = 51) (P = 0.117). Median 25(OH)D concentrations were 76.0, 
79.3, and 80.8 nmol/l, respectively (P = 0.844). Among participants, 93% were 
vitamin D sufficient (25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/l), with no differences between groups 
(P = 0.914).
CONCLUSION: Among adolescents with a history of CMA during infancy, our study 
found no reintroduction failure of milk and no difference in vitamin D 
insufficiency rate compared with peers. Current management of CMA seems to 
adequately minimize later nutritional disadvantages associated with a cow's milk 
elimination diet.

Despite the widely recommended usage of partially hydrolyzed formula (PHF) or 
extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) of milk protein for preventing allergic 
diseases (ADs), clinical studies have been inconclusive regarding their efficacy 
compared with that of cow's milk formula (CMF) or breast milk (BM). We aimed to 
systematically evaluate the effects of PHF or EHF compared with those of CMF or 
BM on risk of ADs (cow's milk allergy, allergic rhinitis, eczema, asthma, 
wheeze, food allergy, and sensitization) in children. We searched PubMed, 
Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for clinical trials published from 
inception to 21 October, 2022. We used the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to grade the strength 
of evidence. Overall, 24 trials (10,950 infants) were included, 17 of which 
specifically included high-risk infants. GRADE was low for the evidence that, 
compared with CMF, infants early fed with EHF had lower risk of cow's milk 
allergy at age 0-2 y [relative risk (RR): 0.62; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.99]. Moderate 
evidence supported that PHF and EHF reduced risk of eczema in children aged 
younger or older than 2 y, respectively (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.96; and RR: 
0.79; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.94, respectively). We also identified moderate systematic 
evidence indicating that PHF reduced risk of wheeze at age 0-2 y compared with 
CMF (RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.85), but PHF and EHF increased the risk compared 
with BM (RR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.31; and RR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.14). 
Neither PHF nor EHF had significant effects on other ADs in children of any age. 
In conclusion, compared with CMF, PHF, or EHF had different preventive effect on 
cow's milk allergy, eczema, and wheeze. Compared with BM, both PHF and EHF may 
increase risk of wheeze but not other ADs. Given that most trials included only 
high-risk infants, more research on non-high-risk infants is warranted before 
any generalization is attempted. This protocol was registered at PROSPERO as 
CRD42022320787.

BACKGROUND: Children with aerodigestive dysfunction often undergo triple 
endoscopy (flexible bronchoscopy, rigid direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, 
and esophagogastroduodenoscopy) for diagnostic evaluation as well as screening 
prior to airway reconstruction. Prevalence and risk factors for eosinophilic 
esophagitis (EoE) in this population are poorly understood.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed for pediatric patients, aged 
0-21 years, who received a triple endoscopy with biopsy from January 1, 2015, to 
December 31, 2019, at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore (CHAM). Bivariate 
and multivariable analyses were used to compare the baseline characteristics 
between patients with and without EoE to assess for potential predictors of EoE.
RESULTS: Of the 119 cases included in the analysis, 16.0 % (19) received a 
histopathologic diagnosis of EoE following triple endoscopy. Patients with EoE 
were more likely to have a family history of eczema (p = 0.02) and a dairy-free 
diet (p = 0.02). Age, sex, history of environmental allergies, and recency of 
initiating oral diet were not significantly associated with increased odds of an 
EoE diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: A family history of eczema and a diet lacking allergenic foods, 
such as milk, may be associated with an increased risk of a future diagnosis of 
EoE in patients with aerodigestive dysfunction. Larger, multi-institutional 
studies are needed to identify early predictors of EoE.

BACKGROUND: The timing of introduction to solid food has been associated with 
eczema and wheezing in childhood. Our aim was to determine whether differences 
persist within the recommended 4 to 6 month age range.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures was conducted among 
children from birth to 10 years of age who were participating in the TARGet 
Kids! practice based research network in Toronto, Canada. The primary exposure 
was the timing of introduction to infant cereal as the first solid food. The 
primary outcome was eczema and the secondary outcome was wheezing collected by 
parent report using the validated International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. Multinomial generalized estimating equations 
were used and effect modification by family history of asthma and breastfeeding 
duration were explored.
RESULTS: Of the 7843 children included, the mean (standard deviation) age of 
introduction to infant cereal was 5.7 (1.9) months. There was evidence for 
family history of asthma and breastfeeding duration to be effect modifiers in 
the eczema (P = 0.04) and wheezing (P = 0.05) models. Introduction to infant 
cereal at 4 vs. 6 months of age was associated with higher odds of eczema (OR 
1.62; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.35; P = 0.01) among children without a family history of 
asthma who were not breastfeeding when solid foods were introduced. Introduction 
to infant cereal at 4 vs. 6 months of age was associated with a higher odds of 
wheezing (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.52; P < .001) among children without a family 
history of asthma who were breastfeeding when solid foods were introduced. There 
was little evidence of an association among the remaining strata for either 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support recommendations to introduce 
solid food around 6 months of age.

INTRODUCTION: Maternal exposure to food chemicals may increase the risk of 
allergy and respiratory disorders in offspring. We aimed to assess the 
association of prenatal dietary exposure to single chemicals and chemical 
mixtures with allergy or respiratory events reported before age 8 y in children.
METHODS: We included 1428 mother-child pairs enrolled in the EDEN mother-child 
cohort. Maternal dietary exposure to 209 chemicals and eight associated mixtures 
was investigated. Allergic and respiratory diseases (wheezing, asthma, allergic 
rhinitis, eczema and food allergy) were reported by parents between birth and 
age 8 y. Associations with the studied outcomes were evaluated with three 
approaches based on adjusted logistic regression, estimating odds ratios (ORs) 
and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). First, food chemicals were considered 
individually, with correction for multiple testing. Second, chemicals selected 
by elastic net regression were considered simultaneously in a multiple exposure 
model. Third, predefined mixtures were introduced in the same adjusted logistic 
regression. Results are expressed as odds ratio (OR[95 % CI]).
RESULTS: Prenatal single exposure to 74 food chemicals was associated with 
higher risk of allergic rhinitis. Prenatal single exposure to 11 chemicals was 
associated with higher risk of wheezing. In the multi-exposure approach, risk of 
wheezing was associated with the pesticides diazinon and triadimenol, and 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 5-methylchrysene. Phytoestrogen resveratrol was 
negatively associated with lower risk of both wheezing and allergic rhinitis, 
and mycotoxin monoacetoxyscirpenol was negatively associated with risk of 
eczema. Finally, a chemical mixture composed mainly of trace elements, furans 
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was associated with higher risk of 
allergic rhinitis (1.33 [1.02;1.73]).
CONCLUSION: Prenatal dietary exposure to chemicals was associated with risk of 
allergic rhinitis or wheezing up to age 8 y. A few chemicals were associated 
with other allergic and respiratory diseases. Larger prospective studies are 
needed to confirm these findings.

INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition 
significantly affecting quality of life. A small randomised trial showed an 
approximately one-third lower incidence of AD in goat milk formula-fed compared 
with cow milk formula-fed infants. However, due to limited statistical power, AD 
incidence difference was not found to be significant. This study aims to explore 
a potential risk reduction of AD by feeding a formula based on whole goat milk 
(as a source of protein and fat) compared with a formula based on cow milk 
proteins and vegetable oils.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This two-arm (1:1 allocation), parallel, randomised, 
double-blind, controlled nutritional trial shall enrol up to 2296 healthy 
term-born infants until 3 months of age, if parents choose to start formula 
feeding. Ten study centres in Spain and Poland are participating. Randomised 
infants receive investigational infant and follow-on formulas either based on 
whole goat milk or on cow milk until the age of 12 months. The goat milk formula 
has a whey:casein ratio of 20:80 and about 50% of the lipids are milk fat from 
whole goat milk, whereas the cow milk formula, used as control, has a 
whey:casein ratio of 60:40 and 100% of the lipids are from vegetable oils. The 
energy and nutrient levels in both goat and cow milk formulas are the same. The

BACKGROUND: Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA) is the most common food allergy in 
children. The reaction is classified into IgE-mediated immediate reaction and 
delayed-onset, according to the underlying immune mechanism, and hence, the 
timing of the symptoms. Case reports suggest that children, with delayed CMPA 
reactions on elimination diet, may develop severe immediate reactions on 
reintroduction.
AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and the risk 
factors of developing immediate reactions to milk and dairy products in children 
with CMPA whose initial presentations were of delayed type.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children, aged 0-12 years, presented 
with delayed type CMPA reactions to the allergy-clinical immunology clinics, was 
performed. The diagnosis was made clinically, and with appropriate allergy tests 
when indicated.
RESULTS: Sixty children were included. Males:female ratio was 1.7:1. Family 
history of atopy was in 72%, and 57% had personal history of atopy. Sixty 
percent were not breast fed. The most common concomitant food allergy was egg. 
The most common initial presentation was diarrhea without protein loss or 
bleeding followed by exacerbation of atopic dermatitis upon exposure to dairy 
products. Immediate reactions developed in 21.6% upon re-exposure. There were 
significant associations with concomitant food allergy (OR 56.6 (3.15-1016.1) 
P<0.0001), especially eggs (OR 12.85 (3.09-53.5) P<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Children with CMPA, who present with delayed-type allergic 
reactions, may be at a significant risk of developing immediate reactions upon 
reintroduction. Evaluation of possible IgE-mediated allergic reactions before 
reintroduction may be advisable.

Food allergies are a serious food safety and public health issue. Soybean, 
dairy, aquatic, poultry, and nut products are common allergens inducing allergic 
reactions and adverse symptoms such as atopic dermatitis, allergic eczema, 
allergic asthma, and allergic rhinitis. Probiotics are assumed as an essential 
ingredient in maintaining intestinal microorganisms' composition. They have 
unique physiological roles and therapeutic effects in maintaining the mucosal 
barrier, immune function, and gastrointestinal tract, inhibiting the invasion of 
pathogenic bacteria, and preventing diarrhea and food allergies. Multiple pieces 
of evidence reveal a significant disruptive effect of probiotics on food allergy 
pathology and progression mechanisms. Thus, this review describes the allergenic 
proteins as an entry point and briefly describes the application of probiotics 
in allergenic foods. Then, the role of probiotics in preventing and curing 
allergic diseases by regulating human immunity through intestinal flora and 
intestinal barrier, modulating host immune active cells, and improving host 
amino acid metabolism are described in detail. The anti-allergic role of 
probiotics in the function and metabolism of the gastrointestinal tract has been 
comprehensively explored to furnish insights for relieving food allergy symptoms 
and preventing food allergy.

BACKGROUND: The microbiota plays a key role in early immunity maturation that 
affects infant health and is associated with the development of non-communicable 
diseases and allergies in later life.
OBJECTIVE: The MYBIOTA is a prospective mother-infant cohort study in Malaysia 
aiming to determine the association between gut microbiota with infant health 
(temperament, gastrointestinal disorders, eczema, asthma, and developmental 
delays) in Selangor, Malaysia.
METHODS: Pregnant mothers will be enrolled in their first trimester of 
pregnancy, and follow-ups will be done for infants during their first year of 
life. Maternal-infant biological samples (blood, feces, saliva, urine, and 
breast milk), anthropometric, dietary, and clinical information will be 
collected at different time points from early pregnancy to 12 months postpartum.
DISCUSSION: This study could provide a better understanding of the colonization 
and development of the gut microbiome during early life and its impact on infant 
health.

Background/Objectives: Food hypersensitivity remains an understudied and 
overlooked subject globally. It is characterized by adverse reactions to dietary 
substances, potentially triggered by various mechanisms. Food allergy, a subset 
of food hypersensitivity, denotes an immune response to food proteins 
categorized into immunoglobulin IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated reactions. 
Conversely, food intolerance, another facet of food hypersensitivity, refers to 
non-immunological reactions, in which the human body cannot properly digest 
certain foods or components, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort and other 
non-immune-related symptoms. The main objective of this study was to determine 
and differentiate the differences, characteristics, and types of food 
hypersensitivity. Methods: This study involved a comprehensive review of key 
research from 1990 onward, including review articles, prospective studies, 
nested case-control studies, and meta-analyses. Results: Recognizing these 
differences is essential for healthcare professionals to ensure accurate 
diagnosis, effective management, and improved patient outcomes, while also 
aiding dietitians in providing optimal nutritional and dietary guidance. 
Conclusions: there are big differences between the main characteristics, such as 
symptoms, complications, and treatments between allergies, and food 
intolerances. Commonly reported trigger foods include cow milk, gluten, eggs, 
nuts, and seafood.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of gluten and wheat in irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) is unclear, whereas it plays a key-role in the diagnosis and treatment of 
noncoeliac gluten or wheat sensitivity (NCGWS). This review aims to provide the 
most recent insights in pathophysiological mechanisms and to summarize the 
evidence for a gluten- or wheat-free diet in IBS and NCGWS.
RECENT FINDINGS: The exact role of gluten and wheat in IBS and NCGWS 
pathophysiological mechanisms remains complex. However, recent findings suggest 
a role for antigliadin antibodies to identify those IBS patients who may benefit 
from a gluten-free diet and low levels of fecal calprotectin to differentiate 
IBS and NCGWS. The importance of gut-brain interactions in self-reported gluten 
sensitive individuals was shown by a strong nocebo effect, although a role of 
gluten could not be excluded. Evidence for a gluten-free diet remains debatable 
in both conditions, whereas a wheat-free diet may have more potential, 
especially in NCGWS.
SUMMARY: IBS and NCGWS are two closely related conditions with a complex and 
largely unrevealed pathophysiology. The role of gluten may have been 
overestimated in the past, but it is likely that certain wheat components, along 
with gut-brain interactions, play a role in both conditions.

Nowadays, the gluten-free diet (GFD) has become much more than the dietary 
treatment for celiac disease. Due to its presumed beneficial effects even in 
non-celiac subjects, it has become a new fashion statement and it is promoted by 
some healthcare professionals, social media and marketing strategists. On the 
other hand, regardless of a proper medical indication, a GFD may present side 
effects, such as poor palatability, high costs and socio-psychological 
adversities. Moreover, it can be an obstacle to correct clinical practice and 
may induce nutritional deficiency due to a low-quality diet. In addition, a GFD 
can trigger or exacerbate many irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like disorders in 
predisposed subjects: reactivity to dietary nickel, the increased consumption of 
FODMAP-rich foods and histamine intolerance seem to frequently play a relevant 
role. The possible intersections between high-risk foods in these categories of 
patients, as well as the possible overlaps among IBS-like disorders during GFD, 
are described. In conclusion, it is advisable to undergo a careful clinical 
evaluation by a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist (in some cases, also a 
psychotherapist) before starting and during a GFD, because both benefits and 
risks are possible. It is also important to take into account IBS-like disorders 
that can be exacerbated by a GFD and that are still underestimated today.

Cu is essential for the growth and organism health. Classically, its available 
fraction has been studied by in vitro digestion studies as a measure of 
bioaccessibility of Cu (Cu-BA). In this work we applied a novel in vitro 
digestion/fermentation method to multiple foods subjected to different home 
cooking techniques (raw form vs. frying, roasting, toasting, boiling and 
grilling) by metabolization with faecal inoculate from healthy adults (HE-AD), 
and healthy children (HE-CH) and sick children (children with gluten related 
disorders, GRD-CH; children with obesity, OB-CH; and children with 
allergy/intolerance to cow's milk proteins, AICM-CH). In raw and cooked foods 
the bioaccessibility of Cu in the small intestine (Cu-BASI) was higher vs. that 
in the Cu bioaccessibility in the large intestine (Cu-BALI) (30.8 ± 15.4 and 
28.2 ± 14.7 vs. 18.4 ± 21.2 and 22.8 ± 22.1 %, respectively; p < 0.001). Total 
Cu-BA in cooked foods (51.0 ± 24.4 %) was higher than that in raw foods 
(49.0 ± 25.1 %). In cereals, total Cu-BA was higher in the raw form, as well as 
in whole grains and those with gluten (p < 0.05). In vegetables, the most 
drastic cooking techniques (roasting and frying) show higher values of total 
Cu-BA compared to raw form and boiling. The Cu-BALI in HE-CH (37.7 ± 23.7 %) is 
higher than that determined in HE-AD (14.1 ± 18.5 %) and sick children (GRD-CH: 
14.6 ± 19.8; OB-CH: 15.5 ± 17.8; and AICM-CH: 26.9 ± 19.3 %; p < 0.001). In 
conclusion, cooking techniques influence Cu-BA depending on the food group. 
Total Cu-BA, as well as that determined in the large and small intestine varied 
according to the category, group and specific foods, which is related to their 
different composition and species of the element. In healthy children, total 
Cu-BALI is higher than in adults and celiac, obese and allergic children 
probably due to growth requirements and specific microbiota.

Postprandial symptoms in disorders of gut-brain interaction and their potential 
as a treatment target.

Postprandial, or meal-related, symptoms, such as abdominal pain, early 
satiation, fullness or bloating, are often reported by patients with disorders 
of gut-brain interaction, including functional dyspepsia (FD) or irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS). We propose that postprandial symptoms arise via a distinct 
pathophysiological process. A physiological or psychological insult, for 
example, acute enteric infection, leads to loss of tolerance to a previously 
tolerated oral food antigen. This enables interaction of both the microbiota and 
the food antigen itself with the immune system, causing a localised 
immunological response, with activation of eosinophils and mast cells, and 
release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine and cytokines. These have 
more widespread systemic effects, including triggering nociceptive nerves and 
altering mood. Dietary interventions, including a diet low in fermentable 
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, elimination of 
potential food antigens or gluten, IgG food sensitivity diets or salicylate 
restriction may benefit some patients with IBS or FD. This could be because the 
restriction of these foods or dietary components modulates this 
pathophysiological process. Similarly, drugs including proton pump inhibitors, 
histamine-receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilisers or even tricyclic or 
tetracyclic antidepressants, which have anti-histaminergic actions, all of which 
are potential treatments for FD and IBS, act on one or more of these mechanisms. 
It seems unlikely that food antigens driving intestinal immune activation are 
the entire explanation for postprandial symptoms in FD and IBS. In others, 
fermentation of intestinal carbohydrates, with gas release altering reflex 
responses, adverse reactions to food chemicals, central mechanisms or nocebo 
effects may dominate. However, if the concept that postprandial symptoms arise 
from food antigens driving an immune response in the gastrointestinal tract in a 
subset of patients is correct, it is paradigm-shifting, because if the choice of 
treatment were based on one or more of these therapeutic targets, patient 
outcomes may be improved.

Some data suggest the existence of intestinal inflammation in patients with 
non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). We aimed to verify whether fecal 
calprotectin (FCP), a marker of intestinal inflammation, could be used to 
confirm this inflammatory status and to test its diagnostic performance in 
differentiating NCWS from irritable bowel syndrome/functional dyspepsia 
(IBS/FD). We conducted a multicenter study, comparing NCWS patients, diagnosed 
by a double-blind placebo-controlled wheat challenge, with IBS/FD subjects. In 
the retrospective phase, FCP values were analyzed to define the prevalence of 
its positivity and its role as a NCWS diagnostic biomarker. In the prospective 
phase we tested the effects of a strict 6-month wheat-free diet (WFD) on FCP 
values. 31.3% (n = 63/201) of NCWS patients had above normal FCP values (NCWS 
FCP +), whereas all IBS/FD patients proved negative (P = 0.0001). FCP using a 
cut-off value > 41 µg/g showed a 58.6% sensitivity and a 98.0% specificity (AUC 
0.755, 95% C.I. 0.702-0.837) in distinguishing NCWS from IBS/FD patients. Of the 
63 NCWS FCP+, 65.1% had negative FCP values after ≥ 6 months of WFD, with a 
significant reduction in FCP values (P < 0.0001). All NCWS FCP- subjects still 
preserved negative FCP values after ≥ 6 months of WFD. Our study showed that FCP 
can be a useful but supplementary diagnostic marker for differentiating between 
NCWS and IBS/FD. Strict WFD adherence reduced FCP values, normalizing them in 
65.1% of NCWS FCP + subjects. These data suggest the existence of two NCWS 
subgroups: NCWS FCP + characterized by a probable predominantly 
inflammatory/immunologic pattern and NCWS FCP- featuring non-immuno-mediated 
etiopathogenetic mechanisms. (Registration number NCT01762579).

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent gastrointestinal disorder 
that has a significant impact on the general population. The suboptimal medical 
treatments available for IBS contribute to its large economic burden. The 
pathophysiology of IBS is complex, and treatments often focus on managing 
specific symptoms. Many individuals with IBS associate their symptoms with 
specific food intake, leading to increased scientific research on the role of 
diet in managing IBS. Dietary management has become a crucial aspect of IBS 
treatment, with initial recommendations focusing on adopting a healthy eating 
pattern and lifestyle. This comprehensive review aims to synthesise the current 
literature on the impact of diet on IBS, exploring various dietary approaches to 
managing IBS, including the low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, 
monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet, gluten-free diet, Mediterranean 
diet, and tritordeum-based diet. It presents evidence from both experimental and 
observational studies and summarises the underlying dietary triggers in IBS, 
including gut microbiota dysbiosis, visceral hypersensitivity, and immune 
activation. In addition, it explores the efficacy and limitations of the key 
diet and lifestyle recommendations provided by dietary guidelines and scientific 
literature, highlighting the importance of individualised dietary strategies 
tailored to the unique needs of different types of IBS patients. By elucidating 
the complex interplay between diet and IBS pathophysiology, this review provides 
valuable insights into optimising dietary management approaches for improving 
symptom control and enhancing the quality of life for individuals with IBS.

This narrative review delves into the intricate relationship between irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS) and food intolerances. IBS, a chronic functional 
gastrointestinal disorder, is characterized by symptoms like abdominal pain and 
altered bowel habits. The prevalence of IBS has increased globally, especially 
among young adults. Food and dietary habits play a crucial role in IBS 
management. About 85-90% of IBS patients report symptom exacerbation linked to 
specific food consumption, highlighting the strong connection between food 
intolerances and IBS. Food intolerances often exhibit a dose-dependent pattern, 
posing a challenge in identifying trigger foods. This issue is further 
complicated by the complex nature of gastrointestinal physiology and varying 
food compositions. This review discusses various dietary patterns and their 
impact on IBS, including the low-FODMAP diet, gluten-free diet, and 
Mediterranean diet. It highlights the importance of a personalized approach in 
dietary management, considering individual symptom variability and dietary 
history. In conclusion, this review emphasizes the need for accurate diagnosis 
and holistic management of IBS, considering the complex interplay between 
dietary factors and gastrointestinal pathophysiology. It underlines the 
importance of patient education and adherence to treatment plans, acknowledging 
the challenges posed by the variability in dietary triggers and the 
psychological impact of dietary restrictions.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. 
Due to the possible overlap of IBS clinical symptoms with gluten-related 
diseases, food allergies, and autoimmune gastritis (AIG), the aim of this study 
was to present the frequency of anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (TTG2) 
autoantibodies, anti-deamidated gluten peptide (DGP) antibodies, specific 
immunoglobulin E antibodies (sIgE) to selected food allergens, and 
anti-intrinsic factor (IF) autoantibodies in adult patients with 
diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). The study involved 244 patients (170 women) 
aged 18-75 years. The antibodies were measured with the use of multiparametric 
immunoassays. Elevated antibody concentrations, irrespective of the class of 
tested antibody, occurred in 44 patients (17.6%), including 11 patients (4.5%) 
with positive DGP antibodies, four patients (1.6%) with TTG2 autoantibodies, six 
patients (2.5%) with IF autoantibodies, and 31 patients (12.7%) with sIgE to 
food allergens. Sensitization to gluten, proteins from cow's milk, and bovine 
serum albumin was found in 2.1%, 5.3%, and 9.0% of patients, respectively. Our 
study showed a high percentage of positive results for the tested antibodies in 
the IBD-D patients, which indicates the need to perform serological tests for 
CD, food allergies, and AIG in this group of patients.

The clinical examination of patients often includes the observation of the 
existence of a close relationship between the ingestion of certain foods and the 
appearance of various symptoms. Until now, the occurrence of these events has 
been loosely defined as food intolerance. Instead, these conditions should be 
more properly defined as adverse food reactions (AFRs), which can consist of the 
presentation of a wide variety of symptoms which are commonly identified as 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In addition, systemic manifestations such as 
neurological, dermatological, joint, and respiratory disorders may also occur in 
affected patients. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of some of them are 
already known, others, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and adverse 
reactions to nickel-containing foods, are not yet fully defined. The study aimed 
to evaluate the relationship between the ingestion of some foods and the 
appearance of some symptoms and clinical improvements and detectable 
immunohistochemical alterations after a specific exclusion diet. One hundred and 
six consecutive patients suffering from meteorism, dyspepsia, and nausea 
following the ingestion of foods containing gluten or nickel were subjected to 
the GSRS questionnaire which was modified according to the "Salerno experts' 
criteria". All patients underwent detection of IgA antibodies to tissue 
transglutaminase, oral mucosal patch tests with gluten and nickel (OMPT), and 
EGDS, including biopsies. Our data show that GSRS and OMPT, the use of APERIO 
CS2 software, and the endothelial marker CD34 could be suggested as useful tools 
in the diagnostic procedure of these new pathologies. Larger, multi-center 
clinical trials could be helpful in defining these emerging clinical problems.

RATIONALE: Following the withdrawal of organochlorines and organophosphates, 
pyrethroids have become the most used insecticides in both agricultural and 
domestic settings.
OBJECTIVES: We analyzed data from the French AGRICAN agricultural cohort to 
assess associations of occupational pyrethroid exposures and 
allergic/non-allergic asthma.
METHODS: At enrollment, asthma diagnosed by a doctor was reported by 11 815 
participants (7028 classified as non-allergic and 4458 as allergic based on the 
presence of eczema and/or hay fever). Individual exposures to 17 pyrethroids 
were defined in 124 992 participants, based on a combination of the history of 
pesticide treatment of 11 crops (grassland, vineyard, wheat/barley, corn, field 
peas, potatoes, tobacco, beets, sunflower, rape, fruits) and a crop-exposure 
matrix.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In men, no association was observed for any of 
the pyrethroids regardless of asthma phenotype. In contrast, in ever-exposed 
women, asthma risk was increased with use of any pyrethroid, both for allergic 
(+80 %) and non-allergic asthma (+40 %). Highest increases were observed for 
allergic asthma with fenpropathrin (OR = 2.00; 95 %CI:1.38-2.90), tralomethrin 
(OR = 1.81; 95 %CI:1.28-2.56), fenvalerate (OR = 1.81; 95 %CI:1.38-2.38), 
permethrin (OR = 1.78; 95 %CI:1.26-2.50) and deltamethrin (OR = 1.76; 
95 %CI:1.35-2.29). Stratified analyses on women who reported living on a farm in 
early life showed stronger associations for non-allergic asthma. For women who 
reported early life living on vineyards associations with pyrethroids were 
stronger for both allergic and non-allergic asthma. Associations for women who 
lived on cattle farms were reduced for some pyrethroids.
CONCLUSION: Occupational pyrethroid exposure was positively associated with both 
allergic and non-allergic asthma in women but not in men.

BACKGROUND: The use of blood specific IgE or skin prick tests (SPT) to guide 
dietary exclusions for disease control in children with atopic dermatitis (AD) 
is controversial. We undertook a consensus exercise on how to interpret SPT 
results and dietary history for cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, and soy in 
children < 2 years old with AD.
METHODS: Fourteen clinicians from general practice, pediatrics, pediatric 
dermatology, pediatric allergy, and pediatric dietetics from UK and Ireland took 
part in an online modified Delphi study. Over three rounds, participants gave 
their anonymous opinions and received individualized and group feedback, based 
on the premise that all children had SPTs. The findings were discussed in an 
online workshop.
RESULTS: Of 18 symptoms, 12 were identified as relevant to immediate and 7 to 
delayed allergy. Regarding SPTs, there was consensus over which allergens to use 
for wheat and soy but not cow's milk or hen's egg; for all study foods, wheal 
size was determined as 0-1 mm negative, ≥ 5 mm sensitized, but between 2 and 
4 mm, categorization varied by food. During the final workshop, consensus was 
reached on dietary advice for nine combinations of SPT results and dietary 
history.
CONCLUSION: We attained consensus on how SPTs and dietary history for four 
common food allergens should be interpreted in young children under 2 years of 
age with AD. These pragmatic recommendations may support clinician education, 
consistency of decision-making, and future research.

RATIONALE: Eczematous external otitis (EEO) is the most difficult-to-treat 
otitis externa, and characterized by the symptoms of inflammation with 
hypersensitivity of the external ear canal skin. It is acknowledged as a chronic 
skin inflammation primarily caused by dermatological and allergic reactions. 
Food allergens are also considered a cause to induce the inflammation. However, 
the role of food specific IgG4 in this disease is unclear yet.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old woman complained of recurrent itching of the 
external auditory meatus for 3 years and nails chapping of hands for 2 years.
DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: She was diagnosed with EEO and underwent the 
therapeutic strategy as food elimination of egg, milk and wheat, guided by the 
result of food specific IgG4 together with probiotics on the basis of previous 
symptom controlling therapy.
OUTCOMES: After 17 months' treatment, she was finally free of all the symptoms 
and the serum IgG4 specific to all foods are under normal limit.
LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report revealing the 
clinical significance of food specific IgG4 in EEO, and the successful treatment 
with diet elimination guided by food specific IgG4 threw a new light on the 
clinical management of refractory EEO.

The impact of food matrices on egg allergenicity.

Kaman K(1), Leeds S(1).

Author information:

Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.

BACKGROUND: Although many studies show the impact of high and prolonged heating 
on allergenicity, scarce research exists that examined the impact of the food 
matrix effect. We presented a case that demonstrates the need for further 
investigation into this field.
CASE: An 8-month-old breast-fed girl with a history of moderate eczema presented 
with concern for food allergy. At 7 months old, she seemed to have difficulty 
with nursing after consumption of peanut butter, and her pediatrician 
recommended further avoidance. On presentation to allergy, she had not yet 
consumed eggs; therefore, skin testing was obtained for both peanut and egg. Her 
skin testing result to peanut was negative, whereas to egg was elevated at 5/20 
mm. To further support clinical decision-making, blood work was obtained, and 
the egg white specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) value was elevated to 1.33 kU/L. 
It was recommended to the family to pursue home introduction of peanut and 
return for oral challenge to baked egg. At 14 months old, the patient returned 
for oral challenge and successfully tolerated one-half of a muffin. She was 
discharged with instructions to continue consumption of one-half of a muffin 
ideally three or more times a week, which the parents reported she continued to 
tolerate.
CONCLUSION: When the patient was 24 months old, the mother decided, without 
consultation, to introduce banana-chocolate chip muffins. With the first two 
ingestions, she developed immediate urticaria. On the third consumption, she 
developed anaphylaxis, which required epinephrine, with rapid improvement. The 
patient subsequently returned to regular consumption of standard egg muffins (as 
well as bananas and chocolate individually), which she continued to tolerate. 
Based on our patient's ability to tolerate baked egg muffins without banana but 
significant reaction to baked egg muffins with banana, a potential explanation 
is that the addition of banana disrupted the egg-wheat matrix. This report 
points toward a continued need to investigate the role food matrices play on the 
allergenicity of foods. Furthermore, this case demonstrated the importance of 
adhering to allergist-prescribed recipes to prevent allergic reactions.

Food allergies around the world.

Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

The increase in the prevalence of food allergy has been considered as the second 
wave in the allergy epidemic following the first wave of increase in asthma and 
allergic rhinitis. It is well known that the prevalence of allergic conditions 
would follow economic development and urbanization in many countries or regions. 
In developed countries, one in three children suffered from at least one 
allergic disorder and these conditions include food allergy, eczema, allergic 
rhinitis and asthma. Food allergy is very often the first allergic manifestation 
affecting infants and young children. The exact etiologies are not known. The 
clinical manifestations ranged from a simple rash or an itch around the mouth, 
to the more severe manifestations of angioedema and potentially fatal 
anaphylaxis. Among all cases of childhood anaphylaxis, food is the most common 
cause. The common allergens resulting in food allergies in developed countries 
include egg, milk, fish, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts. However, there are marked 
variations in the patterns of food allergens in developing countries. In line 
with the epidemiology of asthma, food allergy is also much less common in rural 
areas. Clear understanding of reasons explaining the disparity of food allergies 
between urban and rural population would pave the way to the development of 
effective primary prevention for food allergy.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data regarding the early introduction of the 
consumption of allergenic food among Asian infants.
METHODS: We examined infants who had early-onset eczema before 6 months of age 
and received instructions from certified allergists for the early introduction 
of hen's eggs, milk, wheat, peanuts, and tree nuts.
RESULTS: The consumption rates of hen's eggs were 100% at 24 months. For peanuts 
and walnuts, the consumption rate was moderate at 12 months (48.5% and 30.3%, 
respectively), but by 24 months, it had progressed to 78.8% and 81.3%, 
respectively. In contrast, cashews remained at lower levels than other allergens 
at 20.7% at 12 months and 41.4% at 24 months. No adverse events related to early 
introductions occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In infants with eczema, allergenic foods could be introduced early 
and well tolerated in Asian infants. However, having eczema may indicate a 
predisposition to food allergies, so caution is necessary when introducing 
allergenic foods. The early introduction of peanuts and tree nuts was still more 
challenging in real-world practice in Asia as well as in Western countries.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of early introduction to allergenic foods 
compared with late introduction and its impact on food allergy, food 
sensitisation and autoimmune disease risk.
DESIGN AND SETTING: The systematic review was reported in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 
guidelines. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and CINAHL) were 
searched from inception till 24 October 2022 using keywords and MeSH without 
limitations on publication's language or date. A forward and backwards citation 
analysis was also conducted. Risk of bias was assessed by three authors 
independently, in pairs using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2. Findings were 
narratively and quantitatively synthesised. Certainty of evidence was assessed 
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
approach.
PARTICIPANTS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on allergenic food 
introduction prior to 12 months of age that evaluated its effect on the 
development of allergic and autoimmune conditions.
INTERVENTION: Early introduction to allergenic foods to infants diet.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Food allergy and sensitisation with main measures 
including oral food challenge, specific-IgE, skin prick testing, physician 
assessment and parental reporting. (2) Allergic and autoimmune conditions such 
as asthma and eczema.
RESULTS: Of the 9060 identified records, we included 12 RCTs. We found high to 
moderate certainty evidence suggested that early introduction of 
allergen-containing foods reduces the risk of multiple food allergies (4 RCTs, 
3854 participants, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.74), egg (8 RCTs, 5193 
participants, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.78), peanut (3 RCTs, 4183 participants, 
RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54) and atopic dermatitis or eczema (4 RCTs, 3579 
participants, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00). Effects on other food allergies 
including milk, wheat, fish; autoimmune conditions, and food sensitisation are 
very uncertain and informed by low and very-low certainty evidence. No important 
subgroup differences were observed related to baseline risk of allergy and age 
at introduction. Sensitivity analyses limited to low risk of bias RCTs showed 
similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that early 
introduction of allergen-containing food from 4 to 12 months of age, was 
associated with lower risk of multiple food allergy and eczema. Further research 
on other allergenic foods, and their long-term impact on food allergy and 
autoimmune risk is essential for enhancing our understanding on development of 
these conditions and guiding future clinical recommendations.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of tree nut allergies in children is increasing, with 
walnut allergy being the most common in the United States and Japan. Allergic 
reactions, including anaphylaxis, frequently occur at the first intake of tree 
nuts, suggesting prior sensitization.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify which children should be considered for 
workup for preexisting sensitization.
METHODS: Juglans regia (Jug r) 1-specific IgE screening for 0- to 35-month-old 
children who had a positive specific IgE result for egg white, milk, or wheat 
and had never ingested walnuts was conducted at a food allergy referral hospital 
between November 2018 and December 2022. Clinical data regarding age; sex; 
allergic disease complications; and egg, milk, or wheat allergy were examined 
retrospectively.
RESULTS: The rate of Jug r 1-specific IgE positivity (level > 0.34 kUA/L) of 205 
children (125 of whom were boys) was 9.8%, with a median Jug r 1-specific IgE 
level of 12.5 kUA/L in patients with a positive test result. Eczema was observed 
in 119 patients (58%). The rate of Jug r 1-specific IgE positivity was 
significantly higher in the eczema-positive group (15.1% [18 of 119]) than in 
the eczema-negative group (2.3% [2 of 86]) (P = .002). In the eczema-positive 
group, the rates of Jug r 1-specific IgE positivity per sensitized antigen were 
13.7% for egg, 17.0% for milk, and 17.1% for wheat. The rate of Jug r 1-specific 
IgE positivity was significantly higher in the group with severe eczema (26.6% 
[17 of 64]) than in the group with nonsevere eczema (1.8% [1 of 55]) (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Even in children younger than 3 years, 15% of children with eczema 
and egg, milk, or wheat sensitization were sensitized to Jug r 1.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common conditions 
that often present in the first year of life. Identification of underlying 
mechanisms and environmental determinants of FA and AD is essential to develop 
and implement effective prevention and treatment strategies. Objectives: We 
sought to describe the design of the Systems Biology of Early Atopy (SunBEAm) 
birth cohort.
METHODS: Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
(NIAID) and administered through the Consortium for Food Allergy Research 
(CoFAR), SunBEAm is a US population-based, multicenter birth cohort that enrolls 
pregnant mothers, fathers, and their newborns and follows them to 3 years. 
Questionnaire and biosampling strategies were developed to apply a systems 
biology approach to identify environmental, immunologic, and multiomic 
determinants of AD, FA, and other allergic outcomes.
RESULTS: Enrollment is currently underway. On the basis of an estimated FA 
prevalence of 6%, the enrollment goal is 2500 infants. AD is defined on the 
basis of questionnaire and assessment, and FA is defined by an algorithm 
combining history and testing. Although any FA will be recorded, we focus on the 
diagnosis of egg, milk, and peanut at 5 months, adding wheat, soy, cashew, 
hazelnut, walnut, codfish, shrimp, and sesame starting at 12 months. Sampling 
includes blood, hair, stool, dust, water, tape strips, skin swabs, nasal 
secretions, nasal swabs, saliva, urine, functional aspects of the skin, and 
maternal breast milk and vaginal swabs.
CONCLUSIONS: The SunBEAm birth cohort will provide a rich repository of data and 
specimens to interrogate mechanisms and determinants of early allergic outcomes, 
with an emphasis on FA, AD, and systems biology.

In the United States, approximately 2% to 3% of adults and 8% of children have a 
food allergy. Allergic reactions range from minor pruritus to life-threatening 
anaphylaxis. These allergies often lead to significant anxiety and costs for 
patients and caregivers. Common food allergies include peanuts, cow's milk, 
shellfish, tree nuts, egg, fish, soy, and wheat. Peanut allergy, the most 
common, is the leading cause of life-threatening anaphylaxis. Children with 
asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, or an allergy to insect venom, 
medications, or latex are at an increased risk of developing food allergies. 
Diagnosis of food allergy starts with a detailed, allergy-focused history. Serum 
immunoglobulin E and skin prick testing provide reliable information regarding 
food allergy diagnoses. Primary treatment involves elimination of the offending 
food from the diet. Prevention strategies proven to decrease the risk of 
developing a food allergy include restricting exposure to cow's milk in the 
first three days of life and early sequential exposure to allergenic foods 
starting between four and six months of age. Exclusive breastfeeding for three 
to four months reduces the likelihood of developing eczema and asthma but does 
not reduce development of food allergies. Most children eventually outgrow 
allergies to cow's milk, egg, soy, and wheat. However, allergies to tree nuts, 
peanuts, and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong.

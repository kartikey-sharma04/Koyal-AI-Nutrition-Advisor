BACKGROUND: The use of blood specific IgE or skin prick tests (SPT) to guide 
dietary exclusions for disease control in children with atopic dermatitis (AD) 
is controversial. We undertook a consensus exercise on how to interpret SPT 
results and dietary history for cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, and soy in 
children < 2 years old with AD.
METHODS: Fourteen clinicians from general practice, pediatrics, pediatric 
dermatology, pediatric allergy, and pediatric dietetics from UK and Ireland took 
part in an online modified Delphi study. Over three rounds, participants gave 
their anonymous opinions and received individualized and group feedback, based 
on the premise that all children had SPTs. The findings were discussed in an 
online workshop.
RESULTS: Of 18 symptoms, 12 were identified as relevant to immediate and 7 to 
delayed allergy. Regarding SPTs, there was consensus over which allergens to use 
for wheat and soy but not cow's milk or hen's egg; for all study foods, wheal 
size was determined as 0-1 mm negative, ≥ 5 mm sensitized, but between 2 and 
4 mm, categorization varied by food. During the final workshop, consensus was 
reached on dietary advice for nine combinations of SPT results and dietary 
history.
CONCLUSION: We attained consensus on how SPTs and dietary history for four 
common food allergens should be interpreted in young children under 2 years of 
age with AD. These pragmatic recommendations may support clinician education, 
consistency of decision-making, and future research.

The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is updating the 
Guidelines on Food Allergy Diagnosis. We aimed to undertake a systematic review 
of the literature with meta-analyses to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests 
for IgE-mediated food allergy. We searched three databases (Cochrane CENTRAL 
(Trials), MEDLINE (OVID) and Embase (OVID)) for diagnostic test accuracy studies 
published between 1 October 2012 and 30 June 2021 according to a previously 
published protocol (CRD42021259186). We independently screened abstracts, 
extracted data from full texts and assessed risk of bias with QUADRAS 2 tool in 
duplicate. Meta-analyses were undertaken for food-test combinations for which 
three or more studies were available. A total of 149 studies comprising 24,489 
patients met the inclusion criteria and they were generally heterogeneous. 60.4% 
of studies were in children ≤12 years of age, 54.3% were undertaken in Europe, 
≥95% were conducted in a specialized paediatric or allergy clinical setting and 
all included oral food challenge in at least a percentage of enrolled patients, 
in 21.5% double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. Skin prick test (SPT) 
with fresh cow's milk and raw egg had high sensitivity (90% and 94%) for milk 
and cooked egg allergies. Specific IgE (sIgE) to individual components had high 
specificity: Ara h 2-sIgE had 92%, Cor a 14-sIgE 95%, Ana o 3-sIgE 94%, 
casein-sIgE 93%, ovomucoid-sIgE 92/91% for the diagnosis of peanut, hazelnut, 
cashew, cow's milk and raw/cooked egg allergies, respectively. The basophil 
activation test (BAT) was highly specific for the diagnosis of peanut (90%) and 
sesame (93%) allergies. In conclusion, SPT and specific IgE to extracts had high 
sensitivity whereas specific IgE to components and BAT had high specificity to 
support the diagnosis of individual food allergies.

Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been recommended to reduce parental burden related 
to strict allergen avoidance and induce desensitization and immune tolerance for 
patients with long-lasting allergies to hen's eggs (HE) or cow's milk (CM). OIT 
should be monitored by pediatric allergists specializing in OIT and oral food 
challenge tests to manage allergic reactions. Although a previous history of 
anaphylaxis or multiple food allergies is not a contraindication to OIT, it is 
contraindicated if the patient has uncontrolled asthma, a malignancy, active 
systemic autoimmune disorders, or diseases requiring treatment with 
beta-blockers. A variety of OIT protocols have been de veloped to ensure better 
outcomes and safe up-dosing, including adjunctive therapies with biologics. This 
review provides insight into the practical issues of various immunotherapy 
options for children with HE or CM allergies.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can occur as a complication of 
schistosomiasis. In humans, schistosomiasis-PH persists despite antihelminthic 
therapy and parasite eradication. We hypothesized that persistent disease arises 
as a consequence of exposure repetition.
METHODS: Following intraperitoneal sensitization, mice were experimentally 
exposed to Schistosoma eggs by intravenous injection, either once or three times 
repeatedly. The phenotype was characterized by right heart catheterization and 
tissue analysis.
RESULTS: Following intraperitoneal sensitization, a single intravenous 
Schistosoma egg exposure resulted in a PH phenotype that peaked at 7-14 days, 
followed by spontaneous resolution. Three sequential exposures resulted in a 
persistent PH phenotype. Inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different 
between mice exposed to one or three egg doses, but there was an increase in 
perivascular fibrosis in those who received three egg doses. Significant 
perivascular fibrosis was also observed in autopsy specimens from patients who 
died of this condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeatedly exposing mice to schistosomiasis causes a persistent PH 
phenotype, accompanied by perivascular fibrosis. Perivascular fibrosis may 
contribute to the persistent schistosomiasis-PH observed in humans with this 
disease.

AIM: Until 2001, the Swedish advice was to postpone the introduction of eggs, 
fish and peanuts until the age of 1 year. One reason was to reduce the risk of 
food allergy. The earlier introduction of complementary feeding is now advised. 
Our aim was to study adherence to current recommendations and whether the time 
of introduction changed between 2003 and 2018.
METHODS: Data were obtained from two prospective, longitudinal, population-based 
cohort studies of children born in 2003 (n = 4987) and in 2018 (n = 3936). 
Parents answered comparable questionnaires when the children were 6 and 
12 months old.
RESULTS: At 6 months, in the 2018 cohort, eggs were introduced to 67.2% of the 
infants, fish to 78.9%, gluten to 89.1%, cow's milk to 76.6% and peanuts to 
46.2%. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, introduction of complementary 
feeding with gluten, fish and eggs was made significantly earlier in the 2018 
cohort compared with the 2003 cohort, adjusted for heredity, own allergic 
disease and parental educational level (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Complementary feeding with eggs, fish and gluten was introduced 
earlier in infants born in 2018 compared with 2003, possibly reducing the risk 
of developing allergic disease. Current recommendations from child welfare 
centres are being followed.

The incidence and prevalence of food allergy (FA) is increasing. While several 
studies have established the safety and efficacy of early introduction of single 
allergens in infants for the prevention of FA, the exact dose, frequency, and 
number of allergens that can be safely introduced to infants, particularly in 
those at high or low risk of atopy, are still unclear. This 1-year pilot study 
evaluated the safety of the early introduction of single foods (milk, egg, or 
peanut) vs. two foods (milk/egg, egg/peanut, milk/peanut) vs. multiple foods 
(milk/egg/peanut/cashew/almond/shrimp/walnut/wheat/salmon/hazelnut at low, 
medium, or high doses) vs. no early introduction in 180 infants between 4-6 
months of age. At the end of the study, they were evaluated for plasma 
biomarkers associated with food reactivity via standardized blood tests. Two to 
four years after the start of the study, participants were evaluated by 
standardized food challenges. The serving sizes for the single, double, and low 
dose mixtures were 300 mg total protein per day. The serving sizes for the 
medium and high dose mixtures were 900 mg and 3000 mg total protein, 
respectively. Equal parts of each protein were used for double or mixture foods. 
All infants were breastfed until at least six months of age. The results 
demonstrate that infants at either high or low risk for atopy were able to 
tolerate the early introduction of multiple allergenic foods with no increases 
in any safety issues, including eczema, FA, or food protein induced 
enterocolitis. The mixtures of foods at either low, medium, or high doses 
demonstrated trends for improvement in food challenge reactivity and plasma 
biomarkers compared to single and double food introductions. The results of this 
study suggest that the early introduction of foods, particularly simultaneous 
mixtures of many allergenic foods, may be safe and efficacious for preventing FA 
and can occur safely. These results need to be confirmed by larger randomized 
controlled studies.

BACKGROUND: Previous reports suggested that food proteins present in human milk 
(HM) may trigger symptoms in allergic children during breastfeeding, but 
existing evidence has never been reviewed systematically.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the probability of food proteins in HM to trigger allergic 
reactions in infants with IgE-mediated food allergy.
METHODS: Electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE) were 
systematically searched from inception to November 3, 2021. The data regarding 
the levels of food proteins detected in HM were extracted and compared with data 
from the Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL 3.0) guide to 
assess the probability of food-allergic individuals to experience immediate type 
allergic reactions on ingesting HM.
RESULTS: A total of 32 studies were identified. Fourteen studies assessed 
excretion of cow's milk proteins into HM, 9 egg, 4 peanut, and 2 wheat; 3 
measured levels of cow's milk and egg proteins simultaneously. We found that 
levels of all food proteins across the studies were much lower than the 
eliciting dose for 1% of allergic individuals (ED01) in most of the samples. The 
probability of an IgE-mediated allergic reaction in a food-allergic infant 
breastfed by a woman consuming the relevant food can be estimated as ≤1:1000 for 
cow's milk, egg, peanut, and wheat.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses 
and summarizes evidence on food proteins in HM and potential for IgE-mediated 
allergic reactions. Our data suggest that the probability of IgE-mediated 
allergic reactions to food proteins in HM is low.

BACKGROUND: Understanding risk factors for peanut allergy (PA) is essential to 
develop effective preventive measures.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to ascertain associates and predictors of PA, and 
the relationship between PA and asthma severity.
METHODS: In a population-based birth cohort, we investigated the association 
between objectively confirmed PA with early-life environmental exposures, 
filaggrin (FLG)-loss-of-function mutations and other atopic disease. We then 
examined the association of PA with longitudinal trajectories of sensitization, 
wheeze and allergic comorbidities, which were previously derived using machine 
learning. Finally, we ascertained the relationship between PA and asthma 
severity.
RESULTS: PA was confirmed in 30/959 participants with evaluable data. In the 
multivariate analysis, eczema in infancy (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.5-13.2, p = 0.007), 
egg sensitization at age 3 years (OR = 9.7, 95% CI 3.3-29.9, p < 0.001) and 
early-life cat ownership (OR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.4, p = 0.04) were independent 
associates of PA. In the stratified analysis among 700 participants with genetic 
information, in children with early-life eczema there was no difference in FLG 
mutations between children with and without PA (3/18 [16.7%] vs. 42/220 [19.1%], 
p = 1.00). In contrast, among children without eczema, those with PA were almost 
eight times more likely to have FLG mutations (2/6 [33.3%] vs. 27/456 [5.9%], 
p = 0.049). We observed associations between PA and multiple allergic 
sensitization profiles derived using machine learning, with ~60-fold increase in 
risk among individuals assigned to multiple early sensitization. PA was 
significantly associated with persistent wheeze (but not other wheeze 
phenotypes), and with trajectories of atopic disease characterized by co-morbid 
persistent eczema and wheeze (but not with transient phenotypes). Children with 
PA were more likely to have asthma, but among asthmatics we found no evidence of 
an association between PA and asthma severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Peanut allergy is associated with multiple IgE sensitization and 
early-onset persistent eczema and wheeze. FLG loss-of-function mutations were 
associated with peanut allergy in children without eczema.

BACKGROUND: Food anaphylaxis is commonly elicited by unintentional ingestion of 
foods containing the allergen above the tolerance threshold level of the 
individual. While labeling the 14 main allergens used as ingredients in food 
products is mandatory in the EU, there is no legal definition of declaring 
potential contaminants. Precautionary allergen labeling such as "may contain 
traces of" is often used. However, this is unsatisfactory for consumers as they 
get no information if the contamination is below their personal threshold. In 
discussions with the food industry and technologists, it was suggested to use a 
voluntary declaration indicating that all declared contaminants are below a 
threshold of 0.5 mg protein per 100 g of food. This concentration is known to be 
below the threshold of most patients, and it can be technically guaranteed in 
most food production. However, it was also important to assess that in case of 
accidental ingestion of contaminants below this threshold by highly allergic 
patients, no fatal anaphylactic reaction could occur. Therefore, we performed a 
systematic review to assess whether a fatal reaction to 5mg of protein or less 
has been reported, assuming that a maximum portion size of 1kg of a processed 
food exceeds any meal and thus gives a sufficient safety margin.
METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched until 24 January 2021 for provocation 
studies and case reports in which one of the 14 major food allergens was 
reported to elicit fatal or life-threatening anaphylactic reactions and assessed 
if these occurred below the ingestion of 5mg of protein. A Delphi process was 
performed to obtain an expert consensus on the results.
RESULTS: In the 210 studies included, in our search, no reports of fatal 
anaphylactic reactions reported below 5 mg protein ingested were identified. 
However, in provocation studies and case reports, severe reactions below 5 mg 
were reported for the following allergens: eggs, fish, lupin, milk, nuts, 
peanuts, soy, and sesame seeds.
CONCLUSION: Based on the literature studied for this review, it can be stated 
that cross-contamination of the 14 major food allergens below 0.5 mg/100 g is 
likely not to endanger most food allergic patients when a standard portion of 
food is consumed. We propose to use the statement "this product contains the 
named allergens in the list of ingredients, it may contain traces of other 
contaminations (to be named, e.g. nut) at concentrations less than 0.5 mg per 
100 g of this product" for a voluntary declaration on processed food packages. 
This level of avoidance of cross-contaminations can be achieved technically for 
most processed foods, and the statement would be a clear and helpful message to 
the consumers. However, it is clearly acknowledged that a voluntary declaration 
is only a first step to a legally binding solution. For this, further research 
on threshold levels is encouraged.

The prevalence of food allergy has increased in recent years, especially in 
children. Allergen avoidance, and drugs in case of an allergic reaction, remains 
the standard of care in food allergy. Nevertheless, increasing attention has 
been given to the possibility to treat food allergy, through immunotherapy, 
particularly oral immunotherapy (OIT). Several OIT protocols and clinical trials 
have been published. Most of them focus on children allergic to milk, egg, or 
peanut, although recent studies developed protocols for other foods, such as 
wheat and different nuts. OIT efficacy in randomized controlled trials is 
usually evaluated as the possibility for patients to achieve desensitization 
through the consumption of an increasing amount of a food allergen, while the 
issue of a possible long-term sustained unresponsiveness has not been completely 
addressed. Here, we evaluated current pediatric OIT knowledge, focusing on the 
results of clinical trials and current guidelines. Specifically, we wanted to 
highlight what is known in terms of OIT efficacy and effectiveness, safety, and 
impact on quality of life. For each aspect, we reported the pros and the cons, 
inferable from published literature. In conclusion, even though many protocols, 
reviews and meta-analysis have been published on this topic, pediatric OIT 
remains a controversial therapy and no definitive generalized conclusion may be 
drawn so far. It should be an option provided by specialized teams, when both 
patients and their families are prone to adhere to the proposed protocol. 
Efficacy, long-term effectiveness, possible role of adjuvant therapies, risk of 
severe reactions including anaphylaxis or eosinophilic esophagitis, and impact 
on the quality of life of both children and caregivers are all aspects that 
should be discussed before starting OIT. Future studies are needed to provide 
firm clinical and scientific evidence, which should also consider patient 
reported outcomes.

Celiac disease, a gluten-sensitive enteropathy, demonstrates a strong human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) association, with more than 90% of patients carrying the 
HLA-DQ2.5 allotype. No therapy is available for the condition except for a 
lifelong gluten-free diet. To address this gap, we explored the therapeutic 
potential of regulatory T cells (Tregs). By orthotopic replacement of T cell 
receptors (TCRs) through homology-directed repair, we generated gluten-reactive 
HLA-DQ2.5-restricted CD4+ engineered (e) T effector cells (Teffs) and eTregs and 
performed in vivo experiments in HLA-DQ2.5 transgenic mice. Of five validated 
TCRs, TCRs specific for two immunodominant and deamidated gluten epitopes 
(DQ2.5-glia-α1a and DQ2.5-glia-α2) were selected for further evaluation. CD4+ 
eTeffs exposed to deamidated gluten through oral gavage colocalized with 
dendritic and B cells in the Peyer's patches and gut-draining lymph nodes and 
specifically migrated to the intestine. The suppressive function of human eTregs 
correlated with high TCR functional activity. eTregs specific for one epitope 
suppressed the proliferation and gut migration of CD4+ eTeffs specific for the 
same and the other gluten epitope, demonstrating bystander suppression. The 
suppression requires an antigen-specific activation of eTregs given that 
polyclonal Tregs failed to suppress CD4+ eTeffs. These findings highlight the 
potential of gluten-reactive eTregs as a therapeutic for celiac disease.

As part of the Monash Sensory Science Exhibition, our team guided participants 
through a multisensory journey unraveling coeliac disease development and 
pathology. Through tactile and sensory exhibits, we showed how benign dietary 
gluten can be transformed into a harmful entity for the 1 in 70 Australians with 
this illness. In contrast to the common misconception of coeliac disease as a 
food allergy, our exhibits revealed its closer association with autoimmune 
diseases such as type 1 diabetes, involving genetic susceptibility linked to 
specific human leukocyte antigens, crucial antigen-specific T- and B-cell 
responses and autoantibody production. Tactile models underscored the severe 
consequences of the proinflammatory immune response to gluten on patient health 
and quality of life. This educational event affirmed to us the value and 
importance of fostering inclusivity in science education.

Effective Use of Plant Proteins for the Development of "New" Foods.

Yano H(1), Fu W(1).

Tsukuba 305-8642, Japan.

Diversity in our diet mirrors modern society. Affluent lifestyles and extended 
longevity have caused the prevalence of diabetes and sarcopenia, which has led 
to the increased demand of low-carb, high-protein foods. Expansion of the global 
population and Westernization of Asian diets have surged the number of meat 
eaters, which has eventually disrupted the supply-demand balance of meat. In 
contrast, some people do not eat meat for religious reasons or due to veganism. 
With these multiple circumstances, our society has begun to resort to obtaining 
protein from plant sources rather than animal origins. This "protein shift" 
urges food researchers to develop high-quality foods based on plant proteins. 
Meanwhile, patients with food allergies, especially gluten-related ones, are 
reported to be increasing. Additionally, growing popularity of the gluten-free 
diet demands development of foods without using ingredients of wheat origin. 
Besides, consumers prefer "clean-label" products in which products are expected 
to contain fewer artificial compounds. These diversified demands on foods have 
spurred the development of "new" foods in view of food-processing technologies 
as well as selection of the primary ingredients. In this short review, examples 
of foodstuffs that have achieved tremendous recent progress are introduced: 
effective use of plant protein realized low-carb, high protein, gluten-free 
bread/pasta. Basic manufacturing principles of plant-based vegan cheese have 
also been established. We will also discuss on the strategy of effective 
development of new foods in view of the better communication with consumers as 
well as efficient use of plant proteins.

Coeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder caused by the ingestion of gluten 
containing foods in genetically susceptible individuals, with a worldwide 
prevalence of up to 1%. Currently, the only available treatment is a gluten-free 
diet (GFD). Screening for CD is primarily performed using serum based testing 
for anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies. Patients must be on a gluten 
containing diet at the time of testing to ensure an accurate serological result. 
We investigated the prevalence of a GFD in hospital clinic settings and the 
general population using survey data to estimate the proportion of CD patients 
that may be misdiagnosed for CD based on serological tests. Data were collected 
at clinics of a metropolitan hospital in Sydney, Australia, and the general 
population. Data from Medicare Benefits Scheme and tTG results from a large 
Australian private laboratory were reviewed for comparison. Of 778 participants 
who responded to the survey, 58 (7.5%) were on a GFD. More patients attending 
the immunology (15.9%) and gastroenterology (12.1%) clinics adopted a GFD than 
those attending the diabetes (2.6%) or endocrinology (6.1%) clinics, or in the 
general population (4.3%). More females than males excluded gluten from their 
diet (p<0.0001). Medicare statistics between 2013 and 2019 demonstrated an 
increase in CD serological testing; however, tTG data from a private pathology 
highlighted a stable level of elevated tTG antibodies of 3% of total tests 
performed. The high number of individuals on a GFD is likely impacting the 
ability to accurately diagnose CD using serum-based testing.

In hospitals through Europe and worldwide, the practices regarding hospital 
diets are very heterogeneous. Hospital diets are rarely prescribed by 
physicians, and sometimes the choices of diets are based on arbitrary reasons. 
Often prescriptions are made independently from the evaluation of nutritional 
status, and without taking into account the nutritional status. Therapeutic 
diets (low salt, gluten-free, texture and consistency modified, …) are 
associated with decreased energy delivery (i.e. underfeeding) and increased risk 
of malnutrition. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism 
(ESPEN) proposes here evidence-based recommendations regarding the organization 
of food catering, the prescriptions and indications of diets, as well as 
monitoring of food intake at hospital, rehabilitation center, and nursing home, 
all of these by taking into account the patient perspectives. We propose a 
systematic approach to adapt the hospital food to the nutritional status and 
potential food allergy or intolerances. Particular conditions such as patients 
with dysphagia, older patients, gastrointestinal diseases, abdominal surgery, 
diabetes, and obesity, are discussed to guide the practitioner toward the best 
evidence based therapy. The terminology of the different useful diets is 
defined. The general objectives are to increase the awareness of physicians, 
dietitians, nurses, kitchen managers, and stakeholders towards the pivotal role 
of hospital food in hospital care, to contribute to patient safety within 
nutritional care, to improve coverage of nutritional needs by hospital food, and 
reduce the risk of malnutrition and its related complications.

Recent advances in palmoplantar pustulosis.

Brunasso AMG(1), Massone C(1).

Author information:
(1)Dermatology Unit, Galliera Hospital, Genoa, Italy.

Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory condition where crops of 
sterile pustules with erythematous keratotic lesions causing bleeding and pain 
appear on the palms and soles. Recently, the European Rare and Severe Expert 
Network considered PPP as a variant of pustular psoriasis with or without 
psoriasis vulgaris. The prevalence of PPP varies from 0.050 to 0.12%. PPP occurs 
more frequently in women and the highest prevalence occurred between the ages of 
50 and 69 years. Nail psoriasis seems to be frequent in PPP, ranging from 30 to 
76%, and psoriatic arthritis in 8.6 to 26% of PPP patients. Synovitis, acne, 
pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome and pustulotic 
arthro-osteitis are considered PPP-associated disorders. PPP has been reported 
with other co-morbidities such as psychiatric disorders, thyroid-associated 
disease, altered calcium homeostasis, gluten sensitivity diabetes, obesity, and 
dyslipidemia, but larger studies are required to prove such associations. 
Environmental exacerbating factors might contribute to the onset or worsening of 
PPP such as cigarette smoking, stress, focal infections, metal allergies, and 
drug intake. Genetic predisposition plays an important role in PPP. In PPP, both 
the innate and the adaptive immune systems are activated. The acrosyringeal 
expression of IL-17 has been demonstrated, indicating that the eccrine sweat 
gland is an active component of the skin barrier and an immune-competent 
structure. Increased levels of several inflammatory molecules, including IL-8, 
IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23A, and IL-23 receptor, 
have been detected in PPP biopsies. Increased serum levels of TNF-α, IL-17, 
IL-22, and IFN-γ have been detected in patients with PPP in comparison to 
healthy subjects, suggesting a similar inflammatory pattern to psoriasis 
vulgaris. Oral and tonsillar infections serve as trigger factors for PPP. 
Long-term therapy is required for many patients, but high-quality data are 
limited, contributing to uncertainty about the ideal approach to treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Few data are available regarding the trend of IgA 
anti-transglutaminase antibodies (TGA-IgA) in children with celiac disease (CD) 
on a gluten-free diet (GFD). Our aim is to examine the normalization time of CD 
serology in a large pediatric population, and its predictors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the normalization time of 
TGA-IgA and its predictive factors (age, sex, ethnicity, symptoms, associated 
diabetes/thyroiditis, Marsh stage, TGA-IgA and endomysial antibody levels at 
diagnosis, diet adherence), in 1024 children diagnosed from 2000 to 2019 in 
three pediatric Italian centers, on a GFD.
RESULTS: TGA-IgA remission was reached in 67,3%, 80,7%, 89,8% and 94,9% after 
12, 18, 24 and 36 months from starting a GFD, respectively (median time = 9 
months). TGA-IgA >10´upper limit of normal at diagnosis (HR = 0.56), age 7-12 
years old (HR = 0.83), poor compliance to diet (HR = 0.69), female sex 
(HR = 0.82), non-Caucasian ethnicity (HR = 0.75), and comorbidities (HR = 0.72) 
were independent factors significantly associated with longer time to 
normalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our population is the largest in the literature, with the majority 
of patients normalizing CD serology within 24 months from starting a GFD. We 
suggest a special attention to patients with comorbidities, language barriers or 
age 7-12 years for a proper management and follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: Diet is implicated in the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) and in generating symptoms. Few studies have explored dietary 
practices in people with IBD, in which participants perceived strong links 
between diet in triggering flares and maintaining remission. Fewer studies have 
explored dietary habits in self-reported remission. Our aim was to describe 
dietary practices and beliefs in those with inactive ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: A questionnaire was developed and prospectively administered to 208 
participants with inactive ulcerative colitis attending IBD clinics.
RESULTS: Thirty-one percent believed diet was the initiating factor for 
ulcerative colitis with 37% believing diet could trigger relapse. Fifty-nine 
percent avoided dietary items to prevent relapse. Most frequently avoided were 
spicy (43%) and fatty (38%) foods, alcohol (27%), carbonated drinks (26%), 
coffee (24%) and milk products (21%). Females were more likely to practice 
dietary avoidance (P = 0.007). Twenty-three percent had used exclusion diets, 
most commonly gluten- or lactose-free. Those reporting relapse in the previous 
year were more likely to avoid the same menu as their family (P = 0.01) and 
females were less likely to eat out in order to prevent relapse (P = 0.004). 
Information resources guiding food avoidance included participants' own 
experiences (90%), healthcare professionals' advice (19%) and the internet 
(11%).
CONCLUSION: People with inactive ulcerative colitis hold dietary beliefs and 
display practices with a high level of consistency around perceived triggers. 
Food avoidance whilst in remission raises the possibility of visceral 
hypersensitivity or altered physiology alongside psychosocial, neurocognitive or 
co-existing functional factors.

Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK.

AIM: A recent audit has highlighted that there is a large variation in the way 
gastric emptying scintigraphy is performed, analysed and reported in the UK. In 
this study, we have established a comprehensive protocol on how to perform 
gastric emptying including normal ranges for two of the most widely used meals. 
A standardized scrambled egg sandwich was used as the main meal. Normal ranges 
were also established for oat porridge as an alternative gluten-free meal. We 
have calculated normal ranges for several functional parameters which may be 
used to assess gastric emptying. We hope that establishing a reliable normal 
range for these two simple and commonly used meals will encourage adoption of a 
universally accepted protocol for measurement of solid gastric emptying in the 
UK.
METHOD: A total of 42 volunteers (20 male, 22 female, age range 22-68) with no 
history of gastrointestinal symptoms or diabetes were studied. Each volunteer 
fasted overnight and consumed two meals with similar nutritional composition on 
two separate days: scrambled eggs with two slices of bread were consumed on one 
day and gluten-free porridge (40 g in 200 mL whole milk) was consumed on a 
different day. Each meal was radiolabelled with 10 MBq of Tc-DTPA. Simultaneous 
anterior-posterior 2-min static images were acquired with the patient standing 
between the gamma camera detectors. Images were acquired every 5 min over a 2 
hour period, followed by a single image at 3 hour. The data were modelled using 
a power-exponential function that allowed measurements of gastric emptying 
functional parameters including lag time, half-emptying time (HET), peak 
emptying rate, time-to-peak emptying (TPE) and exponential half-life (EHL). 
Three-hour retention was also calculated. Paired t-tests were used to compare 
the two meals and two-sample t-tests were used to assess gender-related 
differences. Regression analysis was used to assess correlation of the 
functional parameters with age and body habitus (body surface area, BSA).
RESULTS: All gastric emptying functional parameters were significantly different 
between the two meals (P < 0.001). The normal range for lag time was 0-13 min 
for porridge and 1-34 min for scrambled egg. The normal range for HET was 
18-73 min for porridge and 44-116 min for scrambled egg. The normal range for 
EHL was 21-57 min for porridge and 20-82 min for scrambled egg. The normal range 
for 3 hour retention was <7% for porridge and <17% for scrambled egg. Only weak 
significance was found for gender-related differences in gastric function for 
the two meals (0.05 < P < 0.10). Weak correlation was also observed for some 
functional parameters when plotted against age and BSA (0.05 < P < 0.10).
CONCLUSION: We have established gastric emptying normal ranges for the two most 
commonly used meals in the UK. The normal ranges are meal specific and not 
interchangeable, with porridge showing significantly faster transit than 
scrambled egg for all measured parameters. Scrambled egg sandwich is the 
recommended meal for solid gastric emptying studies as it is more reproducible 
and more comparable to a normally consumed solid meal for our population. 
Porridge would be a suitable alternative for patients who are unable to eat egg 
sandwiches, for example, patients with egg allergy or gluten intolerance.

Due to the growing interest in improving the nutritional profile of bakery 
products, we have dealt with the most recent and relevant contributions 
regarding potential replacements for carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Focusing 
on the influence of carbohydrates on metabolism, their excess implies obesity, 
diabetes and tooth decay. However, they are technologically important, since 
they are responsible for the structure of many bakery products. Regarding of the 
lipid profile, saturated fats have a great impact on the appearance of 
cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, nature and the food industry offer 
alternatives to traditional oils/butters with large amounts of omega 3 and other 
components that can mitigate these problems. Other relevant aspects are related 
to allergies concerning egg proteins, gluten or even requirements for vegan 
consumers. Several studies have been performed in this line, replacing eggs with 
milk serum, different mucilages obtained from legumes or some gums, etc. In 
conclusion, many papers have been published showing the possibility of 
successfully replacing (both at technological and sensory levels) less healthy 
ingredients with others that are nutritionally better. The challenge now is to 
combine these better components in a given product, as well as to evaluate 
possible interactions among them.

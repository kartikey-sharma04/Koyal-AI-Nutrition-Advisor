BACKGROUND: Seafood allergy (SA), including allergy to shellfish (crustacean and 
mollusks) and fish, is among the 4 most common food allergies causing 
anaphylaxis, but there are limited data showing SA clinical management in 
different countries.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize a large cohort of patients with fish and 
shellfish allergy and to facilitate standardization of future care for this 
increasingly common allergic disease.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational, noninterventional study 
from 945 patients from 2015 to 2019 in 7 hospitals in the United States and the 
United Kingdom to evaluate SA. A chi-square test was used to detect differences 
in family history, medical history, and current symptoms between patients in 2 
countries.
RESULTS: Underdiagnosed anaphylaxis in patients with SA was associated with 
underuse of epinephrine (adrenaline) autoinjectors in both countries. Oral food 
challenge was used only when skin or serologic test results were negative. 
Asthma and allergic rhinitis were more common in the US patients with SA, but 
eczema was more common in UK patients with SA (P < .001). Respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms were higher in UK patients with SA 
than in US patients with SA (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In international multicenter cohorts of patients with fish and 
shellfish allergy, there are opportunities for improvement in management. 
Physician identification of anaphylaxis, use of diagnostic oral food challenges, 
and anaphylaxis treatment with epinephrine are areas with significant knowledge 
gaps in need of improvement in the United Kingdom and the United States. There 
is an opportunity for the development of unified, standardized diagnostic 
protocols for SA with distribution for allergists and trainees.

BACKGROUND Compression of the vagus nerve by a pharyngeal mass is a 
well-documented condition that can result in sinus node dysfunction (SND). 
However, there is scarce literature on extrinsic vagal nerve compression from a 
tonsillar abscess. CASE REPORT A 59-year-old woman with a history of asthma and 
chronic throat discomfort presented to the Emergency Department with 
bradycardia, palpitations, and voice changes. Following a shellfish allergy 
hospitalization, an otolaryngology evaluation revealed an enlarged right tonsil, 
recommending tonsillectomy, but scheduling challenges persisted. The patient 
reported mild throat pain, dysphagia, hoarseness, rhinorrhea, and exertional 
dyspnea and was admitted for the evaluation of peritonsillar mass. She was found 
to be bradycardic with a heart rate of 47, with an electrocardiogram revealing 
SND. Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, as well as dexamethasone and 
pantoprazole, were initiated. With this treatment, the patient symptomatically 
improved with a new heart rate of 68. She was discharged with outpatient 
appointments, but was unfortunately lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This case 
reveals sinus node dysfunction resulting from extrinsic vagal nerve compression 
by a tonsillar abscess. Pressure on the vagus nerve can trigger bradycardia and 
low blood pressure, possibly due to compensatory overfiring of afferent vagal 
nerve signals from local mass effect. Early recognition and antibiotic treatment 
are essential to prevent cardiac complications. Clinicians must remain vigilant 
for such extrinsic causes, particularly in patients with chronic sore throat and 
cardiac symptoms. Further research and case reports are needed to deepen our 
understanding of this rare yet significant association.

Objectives: Allergic myocardial infarction, known as Kounis syndrome, is an 
acute myocardial infarction after an allergic reaction to food, drugs, or insect 
stings, etc. Kounis syndrome can also be caused by all kinds of seafood, such as 
finned fish, molluscan shellfish, cephalopods, and crustacean shellfish. 
Methods: Herein, we report a case of a 67-year-old man, with hypertension, 
referred for itchiness, facial rash, chest pain, and palpitations developed 
after consumption of blue crab. Results: Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations 
in leads II,III,aVF. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed inferior wall 
hypokinezia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Coronary 
angiography revealed no sign of atherosclerosis. The patient was diagnosed to 
have Kounis Syndrome type I variant, secondary to blue crab ingestion. He was 
treated with oral antihistamines and prednisolone.The repeated cardiac markers 
were within normal limits, with resolution of electrocardiographic abnormalities 
and inferior wall motion echocardiographic changes. Conclusion: All patients 
admitted to the emergency department with chest pain and ST elevation on 
electrocardiography should be asked about allergic insults.

Kounis syndrome (KS) is a complex of cardiovascular symptoms and signs following 
either allergy or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults. We 
report the case of 57-year-old man, with hypertension and history of allergy, 
referred for facial rash and palpitations appeared after consumption of canned 
tuna fish. Suddenly, the patient collapsed: electrocardiogram showed 
ST-elevation in inferior leads. The patient was transferred from the spoke 
emergency room for coronary angio, which did not show any sign of coronary 
atherosclerosis. A transient coronary spasm was therefore hypothesized and the 
final diagnosis was KS. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first 
cases of KS following the ingestion of tuna fish. KS secondary to food allergy 
has also been reported, and shellfish ingestion has been considered as one of 
the most active KS inducer foods. Canned tuna fish too is well known as an 
allergy inducer. Tuna fish allergy should be considered, however, within the 
context of scombroid food poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning. Fish 
with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine 
by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in 
scombroid poisoning. Inflammatory mediators such as histamine constitute the 
pathophysiologic basis of Kounis hypersensitivity-associated acute coronary 
syndrome. Patients with coronary risk factors, allergic reaction after food 
ingestion, and suspected scombroid poisoning should be therefore carefully 
monitored for a prompt diagnosis of possible coronary complications.

College, New York, NY, USA.

BACKGROUND: Despite the emergence of evidence-based medicine, gaps in medical 
knowledge are filled by tradition, common sense, and experience, giving rise to 
medical myths.
METHODS: We explored the origins of and evidence related to four medical myths: 
patients with shellfish allergies should not receive intravenous contrast, 
patients with atrial fibrillation of less than 48 hours' duration do not require 
anticoagulation before cardioversion, patients with suspected meningitis should 
have a computed tomography (CT) scan before a lumbar puncture, and patients with 
respiratory disease should not receive β-blockers. We conducted a literature 
review to describe each myth's origins and the quality of supporting evidence.
RESULTS: All patients with allergies, including but not limited to seafood 
allergies, are at an increased risk for anaphylactoid reactions to 
radiocontrast. No conclusive studies indicate that patients with atrial 
fibrillation of less than 48 hours' duration do not require anticoagulation 
before cardioversion. A CT scan before lumbar puncture in suspected acute 
bacterial meningitis is a clinically inefficient precaution. β-blockers can be 
safely used in patients with respiratory disease and may even prevent cardiac 
events in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These familiar myths have maintained prominent roles in medical 
thinking because they represent wisdom passed down from eminent sources, they 
teach physiology and medical skills, and they offer physicians a sense of 
control in the face of uncertainty. In addition to providing scientific 
evidence, changing physicians' practice requires acknowledging that even 
meticulous care cannot always avert bad outcomes.

Coronary vasospasm can be induced by allergic reactions with some chemical 
mediators, and the angina and myocardial infarction secondary to allergy-induced 
coronary vasospasm are referred to as "Kounis syndrome." Only two cases of 
Kounis syndrome following food ingestion have been reported. However, they had 
pre-existing atheromatous coronary artery disease, and no provocation test to 
induce coronary vasospasm was done. We describe here another probable case of 
allergic vasospasm after food intake. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first documented report of a patient with food-induced allergic vasospasm 
subsequent to the provocation test with ergometrine maleate.

A 65-year-old Caucasian male with a shellfish allergy developed atrial 
fibrillation and hypotension after coronary artery bypass and duodenal ulcer 
surgery. Following electrical cardioversion, oral amiodarone was continued 
chronically without an allergic reaction. There is a common misconception that a 
shellfish allergy correlates to an iodine allergy. There is little documentation 
of the association between an allergy to shellfish and an allergy to iodine. 
Food allergies can be subcategorized based on the involvement of IgE. Upon 
further investigation, it was discovered that shellfish allergies are not due to 
the iodine component, but rather, to a protein found in the shellfish. 
Amiodarone can be safely used in patients with shellfish allergies. A shellfish 
allergy does not necessarily imply an iodine allergy.

Two cases of allergic angina and allergic myocardial infarction (Kounis 
syndrome) secondary to shellfish ingestion are described. The patients had 
pre-existing quiescent coronary artery disease (type II variant of the syndrome) 
and the allergic reaction following eating shellfish seemed to have triggered 
the development of an acute myocardial infarction. The clinical implications are 
also discussed.

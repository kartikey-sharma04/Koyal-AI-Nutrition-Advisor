BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a significant health 
issue in the pediatric age, carrying lifelong health implications. To compare 
the impact of different formulas on the occurrence of other atopic 
manifestations (AMs), autoimmune disorders (ADs) and the time of immune 
tolerance acquisition in a population of children with immunoglobulin E 
(IgE)-mediated cow CMPA.
METHODS: In a 72-month prospective cohort study the occurrence of other AMs 
(i.e., eczema, urticaria, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis), ADs (i.e., celiac 
disease, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, idiopathic 
juvenile arthritis) and the time of immune tolerance acquisition were 
comparatively evaluated in IgE-mediated CMPA children treated with different 
formulas: extensively hydrolyzed casein formula containing the probiotic 
L. rhamnosus G (EHCF + LGG), rice hydrolyzed formula (RHF), soy formula (SF), 
extensively hydrolyzed whey formula (EHWF), or amino-acid based formula (AAF).
RESULTS: 313 subjects were evaluated: EHCF + LGG (n = 64), RHF(n = 62), 
SF(n = 63), EHWF(n = 60) and AAF (n = 64). The incidence of AMs was: 
0.30(Bonferroni-corrected 95%CI 0.15 to 0.44) for EHCF + LGG cohort, 0.68 
(0.52-0.83) for RHF cohort, 0.73 (0.59-0.87) for SF cohort, 0.70 (0.55-0.85) for 
EHWF cohort and 0.83 (0.71-0.95) for AAF cohort. The corresponding risk ratios 
are 2.28 (1.51-3.45) for RHF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.46 (1.64-3.69) for SF 
vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.36 (1.56-3.56) for EHWF vs. EHCF + LGG 
(p < 0.001), and 2.79 (1.88-4.13) for AAF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001). The 
72-month immune tolerance acquisition rate was higher in the EHCF + LGG cohort. 
The incidence of celiac disease was 2/313 (0.006, binomial exact 95%CI 0.0007 to 
0.023). No cases of other ADs were reported.
CONCLUSION: The dietary treatment with EHCF + LGG is associated with lower 
incidence of AMs and higher rate of immune tolerance acquisition in children 
with CMPA.

BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation in children is a vital procedure for those 
with end-stage organ failure, but it has been linked to the development of 
post-transplant allergies, especially food allergies. This phenomenon, known as 
transplant-acquired food allergy (TAFA), is becoming increasingly recognized, 
though its mechanisms remain under investigation. Pediatric transplant 
recipients often require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent graft 
rejection, which can alter immune function and heighten the risk of allergic 
reactions. Our review aimed to gather the latest evidence on TAFA.
METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search from 25 June to 5 July 2024, using 
specific search terms, identifying 143 articles. After screening, 36 studies 
were included: 24 retrospective studies, 1 prospective study, 2 cross-sectional 
researches, and 9 case reports/series.
RESULTS: Most studies focused on liver transplants in children. The prevalence 
of food allergies ranged from 3.3% to 54.3%. Tacrolimus, alongside 
corticosteroids, was the most commonly used immunosuppressive therapy. In 
addition to food allergies, some patients developed atopic dermatitis, asthma, 
and rhinitis. Allergic symptoms typically emerged within a year post-transplant, 
with common allergens including milk, eggs, fish, nuts, soy, wheat, and 
shellfish. Both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions were observed, with 
treatment often involving the removal of offending foods and the use of 
adrenaline when necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent immunological monitoring, such as skin prick tests and 
IgE level assessments, is essential for early detection and management of 
allergies in these patients. Understanding the link between transplantation and 
allergy development is crucial for improving long-term outcomes for pediatric 
transplant recipients.

BACKGROUND: Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most complex and common food allergy 
in infants. Elimination of cow's milk from the diet and replacement with a 
specialized formula for infants with cow's milk allergy who cannot be breastfed 
is an established approach to minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions 
while avoiding nutritional deficiencies. Given the availability of multiple 
options, such as extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk-based formula (eHF-CM), 
aminoacid formula (AAF), hydrolyzed rice formula (HRF), and soy formula (SF), 
there is some uncertainty regarding which formula might represent the most 
suitable choice with respect to health outcomes. The addition of probiotics to a 
specialized formula has also been proposed as a potential approach to possibly 
increase the benefit. We systematically reviewed specialized formulas for 
infants with CMA to inform the updated World Allergy Organization (WAO) DRACMA 
guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and synthesize the available evidence about 
the use of specialized formulas for the management of individuals with CMA.
METHODS: We searched from inception PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the websites of selected 
allergy organizations, for randomized and non-randomized trials of any language 
investigating specialized formulas with or without probiotics. We included all 
studies irrespective of the language of the original publication. The last 
search was conducted in January 2024. We synthesized the identified evidence 
quantitatively or narratively as appropriate and summarized it in the evidence 
profiles. We conducted this review following the PRISMA, Cochrane methods, and 
the GRADE approach.
RESULTS: We identified 3558 records including 14 randomized trials and 7 
observational studies. Very low certainty evidence suggested that in infants 
with IgE-mediated CMA, eHF-CM, compared with AAF, might have higher probability 
of outgrowing CMA (risk ratio (RR) 2.32; risk difference (RD) 25 more per 100), 
while showing potentially lower probability of severe vomiting (RR 0.12, 95% CI 
0.02 to 0.88; RD 23 fewer per 100, 95% CI 3 to 26) and developing food 
protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.82; RD 
34 fewer per 100, 95% CI 7 to 39). We also found, however, that eHF-CM might be 
inferior to AAF in supporting a physiological growth, with respect to both 
weight (-5.5% from baseline, 95%CI -9.5% to -1.5%) and length (-0.7 z-score 
change, 95%CI -1.15 to -0.25) (very low certainty). We found similar effects for 
eHF-CM, compared with AAF, also in non-IgE CMA. When compared with SF, eHF-CM 
might favor weight gain for IgE CMA infants (0.23 z-score change, 95%CI 0.01 to 
0.45), and tolerance acquisition (RR 1.86, 95%CI 1.03 to 3.37; RD 27%, 95%CI 
1%-74%) for non-IgE CMA (both at very low certainty of the evidence (CoE)). The 
comparison of eHF-CM vs. HRF, and HRF vs. SF, showed no difference in effect 
(very low certainty). For IgE CMA patients, low certainty evidence suggested 
that adding probiotics (L. rhamnosus GG, L. casei CRL431 and B. lactis Bb-12) 
might increase the probability of developing CMA tolerance (RR 2.47, 95%CI 1.03 
to 5.93; RD 27%, 95%CI 1%-91%), and reduce the risk of severe wheezing (RR 0.12, 
95%CI 0.02 to 0.95; RD -23%, 95%CI -8% to -0.4%). However, in non-IgE CMA 
infants, the addition of probiotics (L. rhamnosus GG) showed no significant 
effect, as supported by low to very low CoE.
CONCLUSIONS: Currently available studies comparing eHF-CM, AAF, HRF, and SF 
provide very low certainty evidence about their effects in infants with 
IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated CMA. Our review revealed several limitations 
in the current body of evidence, primarily arising from concerns related to the 
quality of studies, the limited size of the participant populations and most 
importantly the lack of diversity and standardization in the compared 
interventions. It is therefore imperative for future studies to be 
methodologically rigorous and investigate a broader spectrum of available 
interventions. We encourage clinicians and researchers to review current World 
Allergy Organization (WAO) Diagnosis and Rationale for Action against Cow's Milk 
Allergy (DRACMA) Guidelines for suggestions on how to use milk replacement 
formulas in clinical practice and what additional research would be the most 
beneficial.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adult food allergy, either unresolved from childhood, or 
new-onset in adult-life, is known to be increasingly prevalent. Although much of 
the reported anaphylaxis in adults is due to drug reactions, foods are becoming 
an increasingly important trigger, affecting adults of all ages, with a wide 
variation in food triggers which are often quite different to those reported in 
children.
RECENT FINDINGS: Peanuts are well known to cause anaphylaxis in some adult 
populations, but other legumes such as soy may be more relevant in others. 
Reactions to natto, fermented soybeans, are currently mainly reported in Japan, 
but changing dietary practices and an increase in plant-based eating mean natto, 
other forms of soy and other legumes are increasingly linked to anaphylaxis in 
Western countries. Anaphylaxis to red meat, caused by sensitization to 
galactose-α-1,3-galactose and first reported in North America, is now a more 
world-wide concern. Co-factor induced anaphylaxis is increasingly associated 
with both wheat allergy and lipid transfer protein allergy.
SUMMARY: More research is urgently needed to characterize adult food allergy, 
its triggers and symptom severity. Unusual food triggers and potential 
co-factors should be considered, so that anaphylaxis in adults can be correctly 
managed, not merely labelled as idiopathic.

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: In the last decade, an increasing trend towards a 
supposedly healthier vegan diet could be observed. However, recently, more cases 
of allergic reactions to plants and plant-based products such as 
meat-substitution products, which are often prepared with legumes, were 
reported. Here, we provide the current knowledge on legume allergen sources and 
the respective single allergens. We answer the question of which legumes beside 
the well-known food allergen sources peanut and soybean should be considered for 
diagnostic and therapeutic measures.
RECENT FINDINGS: These "non-priority" legumes, including beans, pea, lentils, 
chickpea, lupine, cowpea, pigeon pea, and fenugreek, are potentially new 
important allergen sources, causing mild-to-severe allergic reactions. Severe 
reactions have been described particularly for peas and lupine. An interesting 
aspect is the connection between anaphylactic reactions and exercise 
(food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis), which has only recently been 
highlighted for legumes such as soybean, lentils and chickpea. Most allergic 
reactions derive from IgE cross-reactions to homologous proteins, for example 
between peanut and lupine, which is of particular importance for peanut-allergic 
individuals ignorant to these cross-reactions. From our findings we conclude 
that there is a need for large-scale studies that are geographically distinctive 
because most studies are case reports, and geographic differences of allergic 
diseases towards these legumes have already been discovered for well-known "Big 
9" allergen sources such as peanut and soybean. Furthermore, the review 
illustrates the need for a better molecular diagnostic for these emerging 
non-priority allergen sources to evaluate IgE cross-reactivities to known 
allergens and identify true allergic reactions.

9.Immunosuppression risk groups of the Commission for Hospital Hygiene and 
Infection Prevention (KRINKO) at the Robert Koch Institute [349]. Risk group 1 
(moderate immunosuppression/deficiency)– Granulocytopenia < 0.5 × 109 /L; (< 
500/µL) probably up to 10 days (analogous to leukopenia < 1 × 109 /L; < 
1,000/µL), – Autologous stem cell transplantation up to 3 months after day 0 
(day of stem cell return) – Lack of CD4-positive T helper cells < 200/µL 
(Caveat: age-appropriate normal values in children) – Autologous stem cell 
transplantation up to 3 months after intensive therapy phase Patients who have 
more than one characteristic of the immunosuppression/deficiency listed under 
risk group 1 are assigned to risk group 2.Risk group 2 (severe 
immunosuppression/deficiency)– Granulocytopenia < 0.5 × 109 /L (< 500/μL) for 
more than 10 days (analogous to leukopenia < 1× 109 /L; < 1,000/μL) – Severe 
aplastic anemia or macrophage activation syndrome during intensive 
immunosuppressive therapy – Allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation 
up to 6 months after completion of the intensive therapy phase (important: 
extent of GVHD and ongoing iatrogenic immunosuppression) – Acute inpatient 
treatment phase for autologous stem cell transplantation or after solid organ 
transplantation (until discharge)Risk group 3 (very severe 
immunosuppression/deficiency)– Allogeneic BMT/PBSCT in intensive therapy phase 
(until engraftment = regeneration of granulopoiesis) – Severe GVHD grade III or 
IV under intensive immunosuppression The decision to assign patients after 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation to group 3 is ultimately made by the 
treating hematologist-oncologist after reviewing all findings.GVHD = 
graft-versus-host-disease = graft-versus-host-reaction; BMT = mone marrow 
transplantation; PBSCT = peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Table

BACKGROUND: Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy in infants. 
The replacement with specialized formulas is an established clinical approach to 
ensure adequate growth and minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions when 
breastfeeding is not possible. Still, given the availability of multiple 
options, such as extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk protein formula (eHF-CM), 
amino acid formula (AAF), hydrolyzed rice formula (HRF) and soy formulas (SF), 
there is some uncertainty as to the most suitable choice with respect to health 
outcomes. Furthermore, the addition of probiotics to a formula has been proposed 
as a potential approach to maximize benefit.
OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines from the World Allergy Organization 
(WAO) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about the 
use of milk specialized formulas, with and without probiotics, for individuals 
with CMA.
METHODS: WAO formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to include the 
views of all stakeholders and to minimize potential biases from competing 
interests. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the 
guideline-development process, including updating or performing systematic 
evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes 
according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was 
used, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, which were subject to 
review by stakeholders.
RESULTS: After reviewing the summarized evidence and thoroughly discussing the 
different management options, the WAO guideline panel suggests: a) using an 
extensively hydrolyzed (cow's milk) formula or a hydrolyzed rice formula as the 
first option for managing infants with immunoglobulin E (IgE) and 
non-IgE-mediated CMA who are not being breastfed. An amino-acid formula or a soy 
formula could be regarded as second and third options respectively; b) using 
either a formula without a probiotic or a casein-based extensively hydrolyzed 
formula containing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) for infants with either 
IgE or non-IgE-mediated CMA.The issued recommendations are labeled as 
"conditional" following the GRADE approach due to the very low certainty about 
the health effects based on the available evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: If breastfeeding is not available, clinicians, patients, and their 
family members might want to discuss all the potential desirable and undesirable 
consequences of each formula in infants with CMA, integrating them with the 
patients' and caregivers' values and preferences, local availability, and cost, 
before deciding on a treatment option. We also suggest what research is needed 
to determine with greater certainty which formulas are likely to be the most 
beneficial, cost-effective, and equitable.

Conflict of interest statement: The conduction of these guidelines was funded by 
WAO and the McMaster University GRADE Centre. Direct funding by for-profit 
companies was not accepted. The guideline panel members received travel 
reimbursement for attendance at in-person meetings but received no other 
payments. The funding was also used as salary support for the information 
scientist running the original searches, and for research assistants and 
students conducting the systematic reviews. Some members of the method team who 
contributed to the systematic review conduction participated without 
remuneration to fulfill requirements of an academic degree or program. COIs of 
all participants were managed according to WAO policies based on guidance by the 
National Academy of Medicine2 and GIN3. Before commencing the project, all the 
participants were asked to disclose any financial and nonfinancial interests 
relevant to the guidelines by completing the World Health Organization (WHO) 
declaration of interest forms. An independent and anonymous WAO committee 
revised the disclosed interests looking for COIs. The revision committee 
reviewed the forms and deliberated on including panel members aiming to achieve 
a diversity of expertise and perspectives, while minimizing the inclusion of 
panel members with the same or similar conflicts. Specifically, the committee 
placed a high value on addressing conflicts from direct financial interests from 
for-profit companies related to the guidelines' field. Throughout the 
guidelines’ development, the members of the panel and method team were asked to 
update the interest disclosure forms, which were again revised by the WAO 
committee. At the time of appointment, most of the guideline panel, including 
one of the guideline panel co-chair (HJS), had no conflicts of interest. The 
other co-chair (AF) was aware of economic support by for-profit entities 
provided to WAO in the form of educational grants; therefore, he abstained from 
voting on all recommendations in the DRACMA guidelines. The method team members 
deemed to have a real, potential, or perceived conflict of interest related to 
the topic of a systematic review were excluded from partaking in that review. 
Likewise, guideline panel members with manageable real, potential, or perceived 
conflict of interest abstained from voting on recommendations related to that 
interest, while being still able to provide intellectual input and clinical 
expertise. The Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) tables for each recommendation list 
individuals who were excused from voting. One proposed panel member was found 
with disqualifying competing interests and was excluded from the DRACMA project

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This narrative review explores food allergy prevalence and 
natural history stratified by life stages, especially in context of evolving 
knowledge over the last few decades.
RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of food allergy remains highest in early 
childhood with common food triggers being cow's milk, soy, hen's egg, wheat, 
peanut, tree nuts, sesame, fish, and shellfish. This correlates with certain 
risk factors especially pertinent in the postnatal period which appear to 
predispose an individual to developing a food allergy. Some allergies (such as 
milk and egg) were previously thought to be easily outgrown in early life; 
however, recent studies suggest increasing rates of persistence of these 
allergies into young adulthood; the reason behind this is unknown. Despite this, 
there is also evidence demonstrating that food allergies can be outgrown in 
adolescents and adults. An understanding of the paradigm shifts in the natural 
history of food allergy allows clinicians to provide updated, age-appropriate, 
and tailored advice for patients on the management and prognosis of food 
allergy.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common conditions 
that often present in the first year of life. Identification of underlying 
mechanisms and environmental determinants of FA and AD is essential to develop 
and implement effective prevention and treatment strategies. Objectives: We 
sought to describe the design of the Systems Biology of Early Atopy (SunBEAm) 
birth cohort.
METHODS: Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
(NIAID) and administered through the Consortium for Food Allergy Research 
(CoFAR), SunBEAm is a US population-based, multicenter birth cohort that enrolls 
pregnant mothers, fathers, and their newborns and follows them to 3 years. 
Questionnaire and biosampling strategies were developed to apply a systems 
biology approach to identify environmental, immunologic, and multiomic 
determinants of AD, FA, and other allergic outcomes.
RESULTS: Enrollment is currently underway. On the basis of an estimated FA 
prevalence of 6%, the enrollment goal is 2500 infants. AD is defined on the 
basis of questionnaire and assessment, and FA is defined by an algorithm 
combining history and testing. Although any FA will be recorded, we focus on the 
diagnosis of egg, milk, and peanut at 5 months, adding wheat, soy, cashew, 
hazelnut, walnut, codfish, shrimp, and sesame starting at 12 months. Sampling 
includes blood, hair, stool, dust, water, tape strips, skin swabs, nasal 
secretions, nasal swabs, saliva, urine, functional aspects of the skin, and 
maternal breast milk and vaginal swabs.
CONCLUSIONS: The SunBEAm birth cohort will provide a rich repository of data and 
specimens to interrogate mechanisms and determinants of early allergic outcomes, 
with an emphasis on FA, AD, and systems biology.

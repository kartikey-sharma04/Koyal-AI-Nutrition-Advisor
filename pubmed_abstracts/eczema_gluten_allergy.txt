BACKGROUND: Multiple systematic reviews examine the introduction of foods in 
relation to individual health outcomes, but the balance of harms and benefits 
has not been overviewed systematically.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to perform an overview of systematic reviews on age of 
introduction of complementary and allergenic foods to the infant diet and long 
and short-term health outcomes.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed (July 25, 2022).
STUDY SELECTION: Included systematic reviews examining the introduction of 
complementary or allergenic foods before age 1. Outcomes included allergic, 
autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, neurodevelopment, nutrition, and weight.
DATA EXTRACTION: Extraction and quality assessment were performed in duplicate 
(A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and strength of evidence was 
assessed.
RESULTS: We screened 4015 articles and included 32 systematic reviews. There was 
moderate evidence that peanut and egg should be introduced from 4 to 11 months 
to prevent food allergy (6 of 10 reviews). Complementary food introduction was 
not associated with food allergy. Moderate certainty evidence suggested age of 
complementary food introduction was not associated with eczema. Age at 
introduction of gluten was not associated with celiac disease (high certainty 
evidence; 3 of 4 reviews). Low certainty evidence indicated that introducing 
solids before 4 months may increase the risk of childhood obesity, but not 
growth. There was insufficient evidence regarding an association between any 
food introduction and bone health, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune 
disorders, asthma, or allergic rhinitis.
LIMITATIONS: Gray literature was not included.
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports introducing complementary foods around 6 
months and allergenic foods before 11 months.

BACKGROUND: In France, updated data on food allergies (FAs) are lacking, despite 
the need for efficient FA management and prevention. This study aimed to 
evaluate the prevalence of FAs in children in France, describe the most common 
allergens and determine the prevalence of atopic diseases in children with FAs.
METHODS: The ELFE study comprises a French nationwide birth cohort, including 
18,329 children born in 2011. FAs were assessed by parental reports of food 
avoidance based on medical advice related to FAs, provided at 2 months and 2, 
3.5 and 5.5 years of age. Data regarding FAs were available for 16,400 children. 
Data were weighted to account for selection and attrition bias.
RESULTS: From birth to 5.5 years of age, FAs were reported for 5.94% (95% CI: 
5.54-6.34) children. Milk was the most common allergen, followed by egg, peanut, 
exotic fruits, tree nuts, gluten and fish. Among children with FAs, 20.5% had an 
allergy to at least two different groups of allergens; 71% reported eczema at 
least once before 5.5 years of age; 24.4% reported incidence of asthma; and 
42.3% reported incidence of allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis.
CONCLUSION: In France, the prevalence of FAs in children up to 5.5 years of age 
is approximately 6%. It was demonstrated that 1 in 5 children with allergies had 
multiple FAs.

BACKGROUND: Allergy to the omega-5-gliadin component of gluten (O-5-G allergy) 
often manifests when wheat ingestion is followed by a co-factor, usually 
exercise. There is no established best approach to management.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the beneficial effects, firstly of establishing 
a firm diagnosis, and secondly of stringent management, either by avoiding 
gluten ingestion altogether or separating it temporally from exercise by at 
least 4 hours. We also determined how frequently patients adhered to their 
physicians' clinical recommendations.
METHODS: We undertook a survey of individuals diagnosed with O-5-G allergy at 
our institution over 8 years, who had a consistent clinical history and 
confirmatory laboratory evidence.
RESULTS: Of 80 eligible individuals, 43 responded (54%). Symptoms began in 
adulthood for all bar one, and concurrent asthma and eczema was uncommon (9% 
prevalence, respectively). Median time to diagnosis was 2 years. Achieving a 
diagnosis reduced the rate of reactions (0.35 per month vs 1.085 reactions per 
month, p=0.029). Many patients (10/43) did not adhere to the recommended 
stringent approach, to either avoid wheat/gluten or separate food and exercise 
by 4 hours. However, those adopting a stringent approach had a substantially 
lower risk of recurrent allergic reaction (0.22 per month vs 0.74 per month, 
p=0.004).
CONCLUSION: The epidemiology of O-5-G allergy implies pathogenic mechanisms 
potentially distinct from those of childhood-onset food allergy. Accurate 
diagnosis improves the clinical trajectory, primarily through the adoption of a 
stringent management approach.

We present a woman with a three-year history of severe chronic urticaria and 
recurrent vulvo-vaginal Candidiasis in the setting of seasonal allergic 
rhinitis. Her past medical history was significant only for Bell's palsy in her 
childhood. Her review of systems was otherwise negative (specifically: no 
history of diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption, anemia, nor eczema). Extensive 
testing revealed seasonal sensitivities to outdoor allergens and celiac disease. 
Repeating the evaluation six months after initiating a wheat-free diet, her 
vulvo-vaginal symptoms resolved.

BACKGROUND: Associations between gluten intake and psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis, and atopic dermatitis are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether increased gluten intake is associated with 
incident psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis.
METHODS: Cohort studies among women in Nurses' Health Study II. Food frequency 
questionnaires were used to calculate gluten content of participants' diet every 
4 years (1991-2015 for psoriatic disease, 1995-2013 for atopic dermatitis). 
Disease outcomes were assessed by self-report and subsequently validated. 
Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate 
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between gluten 
intake (quintiles) and psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis.
RESULTS: We included 85,185 participants in the psoriasis analysis, 85,324 in 
the psoriatic arthritis analysis, and 63,443 in the atopic dermatitis analysis. 
Increased gluten intake was not associated with any of the outcomes (all P for 
trend >.05). Comparing highest and lowest gluten intake quintiles, the 
multivariable hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.15 (0.98-1.36) for 
psoriasis, 1.12 (0.78-1.62) for psoriatic arthritis, and 0.91 (0.66-1.25) for 
atopic dermatitis.
LIMITATIONS: No assessment of a strictly gluten-free diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the amount of dietary gluten intake as 
a risk factor for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or atopic dermatitis in adult 
women.

In recent years, the role of atopic dermatitis epidermal skin barrier defects in 
inducing a transcutaneous allergic sensitization is highly debated, possibly 
explaining why some children with eczema are sensitized to foods they have never 
eaten. In our specific situation, the association between coeliac disease and 
wheat allergy might be particularly harmful owing to unavoidable strict food 
avoidance. We describe the case of a young boy affected by coeliac disease who, 
after an occasional unexpected ingestion of gluten, experienced a complete 
anaphylactic reaction characterized by urticarial, labial angioedema, wheezing, 
and hypotension. To better investigate the state of allergic sensitization to 
wheat in our patient, we then performed the component resolved diagnosis, which 
showed Tri a19 2 kU/l and Tri a14 0.3 kU/l. These results demonstrated the 
association of IgE-mediated allergy to wheat and coeliac disease. The natural 
course of specific IgE in allergic patients who are on a food-free diet needs 
further investigation, such as the possible influence that the increasing 
popularity of gluten-free diets may have on the epidemiology of wheat allergy in 
westernized societies. National and International registers of cases of 
anaphylaxis may improve the still limited knowledge in this field. The final 
message of our contribution is that the decision to eliminate a food should to 
take into account a patient's awareness of possible consequences.

BACKGROUND: The role of timing and diversity of allergenic food introduction in 
the development of childhood allergic sensitization and atopic diseases is 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether timing and diversity of allergenic food 
introduction are associated with allergic sensitization, allergy and eczema in 
children until age 10 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study among 5,202 children was performed in a 
population-based prospective cohort. Timing (age ≤6 months vs. >6 months) and 
diversity (0, 1, 2 and ≥3 foods) of allergenic food (cow's milk, hen's egg, 
peanut, tree nuts, soy and gluten) introduction were assessed by questionnaires 
at ages 6 and 12 months. At age 10 years, inhalant and food allergic 
sensitization were measured by skin prick tests, and physician-diagnosed 
inhalant and food allergy by questionnaire. Data on parental-reported 
physician-diagnosed eczema were obtained from birth until age 10 years.
RESULTS: Children introduced to gluten at age ≤6 months had a decreased risk of 
eczema (aOR (95% CI): 0.84 (0.72, 0.99)), compared with children introduced to 
gluten at age >6 months. However, timing of allergenic food introduction was not 
associated with allergic sensitization or physician-diagnosed allergy. Children 
introduced to ≥3 allergenic foods at age ≤6 months had a decreased risk of 
physician-diagnosed inhalant allergy (0.64 (0.42, 0.98)), compared with children 
not introduced to any allergenic food at age ≤6 months. However, diversity of 
allergenic food introduction was not associated with allergic sensitization, 
physician-diagnosed food allergy or eczema.
CONCLUSION: Neither timing nor diversity of allergenic food introduction was 
consistently associated with childhood allergic sensitization, allergy or 
eczema.

This position paper considers different aspects of complementary feeding (CF), 
focussing on healthy term infants in Europe. After reviewing current knowledge 
and practices, we have formulated these recommendations: Timing: Exclusive or 
full breast-feeding should be promoted for at least 4 months (17 weeks, 
beginning of the 5th month of life) and exclusive or predominant breast-feeding 
for approximately 6 months (26 weeks, beginning of the 7th month) is a desirable 
goal. Complementary foods (solids and liquids other than breast milk or infant 
formula) should not be introduced before 4 months but should not be delayed 
beyond 6 months.
CONTENT: Infants should be offered foods with a variety of flavours and textures 
including bitter tasting green vegetables. Continued breast-feeding is 
recommended alongside CF. Whole cows' milk should not be used as the main drink 
before 12 months of age. Allergenic foods may be introduced when CF is commenced 
any time after 4 months. Infants at high risk of peanut allergy (those with 
severe eczema, egg allergy, or both) should have peanut introduced between 4 and 
11 months, following evaluation by an appropriately trained specialist. Gluten 
may be introduced between 4 and 12 months, but consumption of large quantities 
should be avoided during the first weeks after gluten introduction and later 
during infancy. All infants should receive iron-rich CF including meat products 
and/or iron-fortified foods. No sugar or salt should be added to CF and fruit 
juices or sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided. Vegan diets should only 
be used under appropriate medical or dietetic supervision and parents should 
understand the serious consequences of failing to follow advice regarding 
supplementation of the diet.
METHOD: Parents should be encouraged to respond to their infant's hunger and 
satiety queues and to avoid feeding to comfort or as a reward.

IMPORTANCE: Timing of introduction of allergenic foods to the infant diet may 
influence the risk of allergic or autoimmune disease, but the evidence for this 
has not been comprehensively synthesized.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence that timing of 
allergenic food introduction during infancy influences risk of allergic or 
autoimmune disease.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and LILACS databases 
were searched between January 1946 and March 2016.
STUDY SELECTION: Intervention trials and observational studies that evaluated 
timing of allergenic food introduction during the first year of life and 
reported allergic or autoimmune disease or allergic sensitization were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted in duplicate and synthesized 
for meta-analysis using generic inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel methods with 
a random-effects model. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Wheeze, eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, 
allergic sensitization, type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, inflammatory 
bowel disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
RESULTS: Of 16 289 original titles screened, data were extracted from 204 titles 
reporting 146 studies. There was moderate-certainty evidence from 5 trials (1915 
participants) that early egg introduction at 4 to 6 months was associated with 
reduced egg allergy (risk ratio [RR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.87; I2 = 36%; 
P = .009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 5.4% incidence of egg 
allergy was 24 cases (95% CI, 7-35 cases) per 1000 population. There was 
moderate-certainty evidence from 2 trials (1550 participants) that early peanut 
introduction at 4 to 11 months was associated with reduced peanut allergy (RR, 
0.29; 95% CI, 0.11-0.74; I2 = 66%; P = .009). Absolute risk reduction for a 
population with 2.5% incidence of peanut allergy was 18 cases (95% CI, 6-22 
cases) per 1000 population. Certainty of evidence was downgraded because of 
imprecision of effect estimates and indirectness of the populations and 
interventions studied. Timing of egg or peanut introduction was not associated 
with risk of allergy to other foods. There was low- to very low-certainty 
evidence that early fish introduction was associated with reduced allergic 
sensitization and rhinitis. There was high-certainty evidence that timing of 
gluten introduction was not associated with celiac disease risk, and timing of 
allergenic food introduction was not associated with other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review, early egg or peanut 
introduction to the infant diet was associated with lower risk of developing egg 
or peanut allergy. These findings must be considered in the context of 
limitations in the primary studies.

Gluten Sensitivity.

Catassi C(1).

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome characterized by intestinal 
and extraintestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food 
in subjects who are not affected by either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy 
(WA). The prevalence of NCGS is not clearly defined yet. Indirect evidence 
suggests that NCGS is slightly more common than CD, the latter affecting around 
1% of the general population. NCGS has been mostly described in adults, 
particularly in females in the age group of 30-50 years; however, pediatric case 
series have also been reported. Since NCGS may be transient, gluten tolerance 
needs to be reassessed over time in patients with NCGS. NCGS is characterized by 
symptoms that usually occur soon after gluten ingestion, disappear with gluten 
withdrawal, and relapse following gluten challenge within hours/days. The 
'classical' presentation of NCGS is a combination of irritable bowel 
syndrome-like symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, bowel habit 
abnormalities (either diarrhea or constipation), and systemic manifestations 
such as 'foggy mind', headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm 
numbness, dermatitis (eczema or skin rash), depression, and anemia. In recent 
years, several studies explored the relationship between the ingestion of 
gluten-containing food and the appearance of neurological and psychiatric 
disorders/symptoms like ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia, autism, 
depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (so-called gluten psychosis). The 
diagnosis of NCGS should be considered in patients with persistent intestinal 
and/or extraintestinal complaints showing a normal result of the CD and WA 
serological markers on a gluten-containing diet, usually reporting worsening of 
symptoms after eating gluten-rich food. NCGS should not be an exclusion 
diagnosis only. Unfortunately, no biomarker is sensitive and specific enough for 
diagnostic purposes; therefore, the diagnosis of NCGS is currently based on 
establishing a clear-cut cause-effect relationship between the ingestion of 
gluten and the appearance of symptoms by a standardized double-blind, 
placebo-controlled gluten challenge.

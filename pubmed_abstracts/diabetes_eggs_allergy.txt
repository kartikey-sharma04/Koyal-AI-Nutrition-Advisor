In Europe, organic food must comply with specific regulations which do not 
include nutritional criteria. The ability of organic food to meet the 
nutritional needs of children is not assessed. This narrative review discusses 
the nutritional composition (macronutrients, micronutrients) of organic food 
compared with conventional products and its clinical relevance with a paediatric 
focus, as well as the health impact of these differences and of contaminants 
which interfere with metabolism. Other potential differences, particularly 
regarding the direct/indirect exposure to other contaminants in conventional 
food, are not addressed in this review. The composition of some organic food may 
differ from conventional food. Protein content was lower in cereals and eggs. A 
lower n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) ratio was observed in milk, meat and 
eggs. Long-chain PUFA and vitamin E may be higher in milk, meat and fish, as 
well as some minerals and antioxidants (phenolic compounds, vitamin C) in 
fruits, vegetables and starchy food and carotenoids in fruits and vegetables. 
Epidemiological studies suggest an association between organic diets and lower 
prevalence of childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, whereas 
the protective effect on allergy and cancer is controversial. Some organic food 
may be of greater nutritional interest for children's diet than conventional 
food. Standardised studies comparing food composition and diet in children are 
needed. Considering the lower toxicologic risk and the sustainability of organic 
food, the Committee on Nutrition encourages the use of organic food, provided 
that such food is affordable, alongside specific baby food which is subject to 
strict specific European Union regulations.

BACKGROUND: Egg oral immunotherapy (OIT) can induce desensitization or remission 
of egg allergy in children.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of OIT for raw egg allergy in 
school-age children compared with egg avoidance, and the most cost-effective age 
at which to commence treatment.
METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model estimated the health and cost outcomes 
of 1,000 children aged 4 years with egg allergy, comparing different ages of OIT 
commencement (ages 4-12, inclusive) versus ongoing egg avoidance. Years lived 
with egg allergy, egg tolerance or remission (natural and OIT-induced), and 
desensitization to egg were captured, with rates of allergic reactions and 
utility values assigned to each health state. Treatment effects were derived 
from published randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses. The main outcome 
was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the Australian health 
care payer perspective (costs in Australian dollars per quality-adjusted 
life-year [QALY] gained), with a 20-year time horizon, 5% annual discounting, 
and an AU $50,000/QALY willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold.
RESULTS: Without OIT, 858 children attained natural resolution before age 24. 
Under conservative assumptions, with OIT-induced remission set at zero and 84% 
achieving desensitization, ICERs were below the WTP threshold for treatment 
commencement at age 8 or older, with the smallest ICER observed at age 12 (AU 
$43,233/QALY; 95% CI, 32,025-73,350). However, the cost-effectiveness of OIT was 
achieved at all ages (ICER less than the WTP threshold) when OIT-induced 
remission increased to ∼40% of treated children.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on current published evidence, the cost-effectiveness of egg 
OIT improves with increased age of treatment commencement. Cost-effectiveness 
increases when the proportion of children achieving OIT-induced remission 
increases.

Eggs: Healthy or Risky? A Review of Evidence from High Quality Studies on Hen's 
Eggs.

Hen's eggs (from Gallus gallus domesticus) provide choline, folate, vitamin D, 
iodine, B vitamins and high-quality protein and are no longer viewed by national 
bodies as a risk factor for hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Yet, questions remain about the benefits and risks of eating eggs 
regularly. This review evaluates recent high-quality evidence from randomised 
controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses of observational studies and considers 
new areas of interest, such as weight management, protein metabolism, allergy 
risk and sustainability. In several RCT, eggs increased muscle protein synthesis 
and lowered fat mass, which could support optimal body composition. Eggs within 
a meal improved satiety, which could translate into lower energy intakes, 
although more RCT are needed. In observational studies, higher egg consumption 
was associated with a null effect or a modest reduced risk of CVD. For type 2 
diabetes (T2D) incidence and risk of CVD in people with T2D, there were 
inconsistencies between observational and RCT data, with the former noting 
positive associations and the latter seeing no effect of higher egg intake on 
markers of T2D and CVD. Sustainability metrics suggest that eggs have the lowest 
planetary impact amongst animal proteins. To lower allergy risk, earlier 
introduction of eggs into weaning diets is warranted. In conclusion, the balance 
of evidence points to eggs being a nutritious food suggesting there are broad 
health benefits from including eggs in the diet at intakes higher than that 
currently consumed by European populations.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal parasitic infections are common in humans, especially 
among young children. These conditions are often asymptomatic and self-limiting, 
and diagnosis is mainly based on the search for ova and parasites in the stools 
since serology may be biased due to cross reactivity between parasites. Pinworm 
is common in children and is not usually associated with hypereosinophilia; 
adhesive-tape test is the gold standard testing for the microscopic detection of 
Enterobious vermicularis (Ev) eggs.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old boy was referred due to a self-resolving 
episode of vomiting and palpebral oedema after dinner, together with a history 
of chronic rhinitis, chronic cough, absolute IgA deficiency and Hashimoto's 
thyroiditis and hypereosinophilia (higher value = 3140/µl). On evaluation we 
detected only palpable thyroid and hypertrophic nasal turbinates. Food allergy 
was excluded, but skin prick tests showed sensitization to house dust mites and 
cat epithelium and spirometry showed a marked obstructive pattern with positive 
bronchodilation test prompting the diagnosis of asthma for which maintenance 
inhaled treatment was started. Chest x-ray and abdomen ultrasound were negative. 
Further blood testing showed positive IgG anti-Echinococcus spp. and 
Strongyloides stercoralis and positive IgE for Ascaris, while Ev were detected 
both by the adhesive tape test and stool examination, so that we made a final 
diagnosis of pinworm infection. Three months after adequate treatment with 
pyrantel pamoate the adhesive-tape test turned out negative and blood testing 
showed a normal eosinophil count. The child later developed also type 1 
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest the need to investigate for enterobiasis in children 
with hypereosinophilia and to consider autoimmunity as a potential confounding 
factor when interpreting serology for helminths.

BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease mediated by 
autoreactive T cells and dominated by Th1 response polarization. Insulin 
replacement therapy faces great challenges to this autoimmune disease, requiring 
highly frequent daily administration. Intriguingly, the progression of T1DM has 
proven to be prevented or attenuated by helminth infection or worm antigens for 
a relatively long term. However, the inevitable problems of low safety and poor 
compliance arise from infection with live worms or direct injection of antigens. 
Microneedles would be a promising candidate for local delivery of intact 
antigens, thus providing an opportunity for the clinical immunotherapy of 
parasitic products.
METHODS: We developed a Schistosoma japonicum-egg tip-loaded asymmetric 
microneedle patch (STAMP) system, which serves as a new strategy to combat TIDM. 
In order to improve retention time and reduce contamination risk, a specific 
imperfection was introduced on the STAMP (asymmetric structure), which allows 
the tip to quickly separate from the base layer, improving reaction time and 
patient's comfort. After loading Schistosoma japonicum-egg as the immune 
regulator, the effects of STAMP on blood glucose control and pancreatic 
pathological progression improvement were evaluated in vivo. Meanwhile, the 
immunoregulatory mechanism and biosafety of STAMP were confirmed by 
histopathology, qRT-PCR, ELISA and Flow cytometric analysis.
RESULTS: Here, the newly developed STAMP was able to significantly reduce blood 
glucose and attenuate the pancreatic injury in T1DM mice independent of the 
adjuvants. The isolated Schistosoma japonicum-eggs micron slowly degraded in the 
skin and continuously released egg antigen for at least 2 weeks, ensuring 
localization and safety of antigen stimulation. This phenomenon should be 
attributed to the shift of Th2 immune response to reduce Th1 polarization.
CONCLUSION: Our results exhibited that STAMP could significantly regulate the 
blood glucose level and attenuate pancreatic pathological injury in T1DM mice by 
balancing the Th1/Th2 immune responses, which is independent of adjuvants. This 
technology opens a new window for the application of parasite products in 
clinical immunotherapy.

Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK.

AIM: A recent audit has highlighted that there is a large variation in the way 
gastric emptying scintigraphy is performed, analysed and reported in the UK. In 
this study, we have established a comprehensive protocol on how to perform 
gastric emptying including normal ranges for two of the most widely used meals. 
A standardized scrambled egg sandwich was used as the main meal. Normal ranges 
were also established for oat porridge as an alternative gluten-free meal. We 
have calculated normal ranges for several functional parameters which may be 
used to assess gastric emptying. We hope that establishing a reliable normal 
range for these two simple and commonly used meals will encourage adoption of a 
universally accepted protocol for measurement of solid gastric emptying in the 
UK.
METHOD: A total of 42 volunteers (20 male, 22 female, age range 22-68) with no 
history of gastrointestinal symptoms or diabetes were studied. Each volunteer 
fasted overnight and consumed two meals with similar nutritional composition on 
two separate days: scrambled eggs with two slices of bread were consumed on one 
day and gluten-free porridge (40 g in 200 mL whole milk) was consumed on a 
different day. Each meal was radiolabelled with 10 MBq of Tc-DTPA. Simultaneous 
anterior-posterior 2-min static images were acquired with the patient standing 
between the gamma camera detectors. Images were acquired every 5 min over a 2 
hour period, followed by a single image at 3 hour. The data were modelled using 
a power-exponential function that allowed measurements of gastric emptying 
functional parameters including lag time, half-emptying time (HET), peak 
emptying rate, time-to-peak emptying (TPE) and exponential half-life (EHL). 
Three-hour retention was also calculated. Paired t-tests were used to compare 
the two meals and two-sample t-tests were used to assess gender-related 
differences. Regression analysis was used to assess correlation of the 
functional parameters with age and body habitus (body surface area, BSA).
RESULTS: All gastric emptying functional parameters were significantly different 
between the two meals (P < 0.001). The normal range for lag time was 0-13 min 
for porridge and 1-34 min for scrambled egg. The normal range for HET was 
18-73 min for porridge and 44-116 min for scrambled egg. The normal range for 
EHL was 21-57 min for porridge and 20-82 min for scrambled egg. The normal range 
for 3 hour retention was <7% for porridge and <17% for scrambled egg. Only weak 
significance was found for gender-related differences in gastric function for 
the two meals (0.05 < P < 0.10). Weak correlation was also observed for some 
functional parameters when plotted against age and BSA (0.05 < P < 0.10).
CONCLUSION: We have established gastric emptying normal ranges for the two most 
commonly used meals in the UK. The normal ranges are meal specific and not 
interchangeable, with porridge showing significantly faster transit than 
scrambled egg for all measured parameters. Scrambled egg sandwich is the 
recommended meal for solid gastric emptying studies as it is more reproducible 
and more comparable to a normally consumed solid meal for our population. 
Porridge would be a suitable alternative for patients who are unable to eat egg 
sandwiches, for example, patients with egg allergy or gluten intolerance.

BACKGROUND: Allergic diseases are more common in Finland than in Estonia, 
which-according to the biodiversity hypothesis-could relate to differences in 
early microbial exposures.
METHODS: We aimed at defining possible microbial perturbations preceding early 
atopic sensitization. Stool, nasal and skin samples of 6-month-old DIABIMMUNE 
study participants with HLA susceptibility to type 1 diabetes were collected. We 
compared microbiotas of sensitized (determined by specific IgE results at 
18 months of age) and unsensitized Estonian and Finnish children.
RESULTS: Sensitization was differentially targeted between populations, as 
egg-specific and birch pollen-specific IgE was more common in Finland. Microbial 
diversity and community composition also differed; the genus Acinetobacter was 
more abundant in Estonian skin and nasal samples. Particularly, the strain-level 
profile of Acinetobacter lwoffii was more diverse in Estonian samples. Early 
microbiota was not generally associated with later sensitization. Microbial 
composition tended to differ between children with or without IgE-related 
sensitization, but only in Finland. While land-use pattern (ie green areas vs. 
urban landscapes around the children's homes) was not associated with microbiota 
as a whole, it associated with the composition of the genus Acinetobacter. 
Breastfeeding affected gut microbial composition and seemed to protect from 
sensitization.
CONCLUSIONS: In accordance with the biodiversity hypothesis, our results support 
disparate early exposure to environmental microbes between Finnish and Estonian 
children and suggest a significant role of the genus Acinetobacter in the 
allergy gap between the two populations. The significance of the observed 
differences for later allergic sensitization remains open.

Several dietary factors have been suspected to play a role in the development of 
advanced islet autoimmunity (IA) and/or type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the evidence 
is fragmentary. A prospective population-based cohort of 6081 Finnish newborn 
infants with HLA-DQB1-conferred susceptibility to T1D was followed up to 15 
years of age. Diabetes-associated autoantibodies and diet were assessed at 3- to 
12-month intervals. We aimed to study the association between consumption of 
selected foods and the development of advanced IA longitudinally with Cox 
regression models (CRM), basic joint models (JM) and joint latent class mixed 
models (JLCMM). The associations of these foods to T1D risk were also studied to 
investigate consistency between alternative endpoints. The JM showed a marginal 
association between meat consumption and advanced IA: the hazard ratio adjusted 
for selected confounding factors was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12). The JLCMM 
identified two classes in the consumption trajectories of fish and a marginal 
protective association for high consumers compared to low consumers: the 
adjusted hazard ratio was 0.68 (0.44, 1.05). Similar findings were obtained for 
T1D risk with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.13 (1.02, 1.24) for meat and 0.45 
(0.23, 0.86) for fish consumption. Estimates from the CRMs were closer to unity 
and CIs were narrower compared to the JMs. Findings indicate that intake of meat 
might be directly and fish inversely associated with the development of advanced 
IA and T1D, and that disease hazards in longitudinal nutritional epidemiology 
are more appropriately modeled by joint models than with naive approaches.

BACKGROUND: Angioedema (AE) is acute oedema of the skin and mucous surfaces, 
involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. AE could be a 
life-threatening medical condition. Regardless of its growing clinical 
importance, many aspects of its aetiology and pathogenesis remain poorly 
understood. Its incidence, demographic characteristics, diagnosis and therapy, 
need further investigation.
AIM: This study reports our experience with angioedema concerning its social and 
demographic characteristics, aetiology, clinical features, diagnosis and 
treatment outcomes. Study design: Eighty-eight patients with AE were enrolled. 
The study is a retrospective analysis of patients treated in our Clinics.
METHODS: All participants were asked on a voluntary basis to fill out a 
specially designed questionnaire on the day of their discharge. Other important 
data sources included: patients' history and notes during the hospital stay, 
information from previous admissions, etc. Parametric and non-parametric 
statistical methods were used for data processing. Data analysis was performed 
using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM SPSS Statistica) version 20.0.
RESULTS: Based on our results, AE affects more frequently patients over 50 years 
of age, regardless of their sex. Urban residents prevail, among them - more 
commonly working women. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormones 
and antibiotics were among the most common triggers - in 8%, 4.5% and 11.4% of 
the cases respectively. In 9.09% of the patients, food-induced AE was seen, the 
most common foods reported, were - nuts, eggs and egg products. The common sites 
of involvement were periorbital area and lips. In only 9.1% of the patients, 
oedema progressed to spread to the upper respiratory tract. Cardiac conditions 
were the most frequent underlying disorders - 33%, of the patients, auto-immune 
thyroiditis was the second most common-14.8%, followed by musculo- skeletal 
disorders (10.2%) and diabetes (4.5%) Family history of allergy was seen in 8.4% 
of the patients, the most frequent allergic disorder, reported, was asthma. In 
patients with HAE, family history was present in 2.9% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients received therapy with steroids and antihistamines, 
resulting in resolution of symptoms and no invasive procedures were necessary. 
Based on our results, the diagnosis of AE is often difficult and delayed and 
requires specialist evaluation. If recognised on time and adequately treated, 
the outcomes are favourable.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between allergy and celiac disease (CD) is not 
clear.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to investigate the association of CD 
and CD antibody positivity with hay fever, asthma and immunoglobulin (Ig)E 
sensitization in a general adult population.
METHODS: A total of 2297 individuals were screened for CD antibodies and 
underwent allergy testing. CD antibody-positive participants were invited to 
undergo clinical evaluation including biopsies. Additionally, biobank blood 
samples from four population-based studies (6423, 973, 1718 and 1101 
participants) with data on IgE sensitization to inhalant allergens were screened 
for CD antibodies. CD antibody-positive participants were screened for serum IgE 
against food allergens in three biobank studies. CD-antibody positivity was 
defined as IgA or IgG tissue transglutaminase ≥7 U/ml and/or IgG deamidated 
gliadin peptide ≥10 U/ml.
RESULTS: The nine participants (0.4%) diagnosed with CD had significantly higher 
prevalence of IgE sensitization to wheat and dust mites. The prevalence of CD 
antibody positivity was 0.8% (18/2297), and these participants had a 
significantly higher prevalence of IgE sensitization to food allergens (Fx5), 
egg, dust mites and mugwort. In the biobank studies, the prevalence of CD 
antibody positivity was 0.8% to 1.2%. One study showed a positive association 
between CD antibody positivity and IgE sensitization for dog, horse and food 
allergens.
CONCLUSION: We found a possible association of CD and IgE sensitization to some 
food and inhalant allergens in the Health2006 study. In further studies, 
however, we could not consistently replicate these associations.

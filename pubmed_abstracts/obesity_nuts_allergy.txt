PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this narrative review, we provide an overview of how 
adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern can complement traditional 
treatment strategies for psoriasis, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa. We 
emphasize the importance of an integrated approach, with dietary interventions 
as a key component of holistic patient care.
RECENT FINDINGS: Psoriasis, acne, and hidradenitis suppurativa are 
immune-mediated chronic diseases marked by systemic inflammation, with genetic 
and environmental factors influencing their onset. The Mediterranean diet, rich 
in plant-based foods with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties-such as 
whole-grain cereals, extra-virgin olive oil, vegetables, legumes, fruits, and 
nuts-has been shown to reduce the clinical severity of these conditions. It also 
supports weight control and positively impacts metabolic and cardiovascular risk 
factors, which are closely linked to these diseases. Dietary education, 
particularly about the Mediterranean diet, plays a crucial role in the 
management of these skin diseases and serves as an important non-pharmacological 
treatment option that can influence patient prognosis. This review offers 
specific nutrition recommendations for prescribing the Mediterranean diet to 
patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases.

BACKGROUND: Adoption of allergen avoidance diets may increase the risk of 
nutritional deficiencies and affect growth in children with food allergy (FA). 
How these dietary restrictions have an impact on diet diversity, a 
health-promoting eating behavior, remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diet diversity, dietary intake, and weight status of 
children with FA.
DESIGN: Observational study.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One hundred children with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated 
milk, egg, or nut FA or multiple FAs and 60 children with perennial respiratory 
allergies (RA) matched as controls, aged 3 to 18 years, were consecutively 
recruited into the study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intake and diet diversity (number of different 
foods consumed/day) were assessed through 4 24-hour recalls. Weight status 
(underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity) was also evaluated.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Chi-squared test and 2-sample independent t test 
were used to test differences between groups. Adjustment for sex, age, and 
energy intake was made using linear regression.
RESULTS: The percentage of underweight was higher in children with FA (19.6%) 
compared with children in the control group (5.1%). Children with FA compared 
with children in the control group consumed more servings of meat (1.7, 95% CI, 
1.6, 1.9 vs. 1.5, 95% CI, 1.3, 1.7 servings/day [Padj = 0.031]). No difference 
was observed in the diet diversity between the 2 groups (11-12 different 
foods/day). Within the FA group, children with allergy to milk proteins had 
lower energy intake from protein, lower intake of calcium, lower consumption of 
commercially prepared sweets, and higher consumption of eggs, compared with 
children with nut or egg allergy, but no difference in diet diversity was 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet diversity did not differ between children with FA and children 
with no FA, despite some differences in the intake from specific food groups. 
However, the higher percentage of underweight in children with FA suggests the 
need for targeted nutrition intervention as early as possible after FA 
diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Omega-3 supplementation has been reported to modulate immune 
responses and prevent food allergies among children; however, findings are 
inconsistent, and the timing of supplementation, which is critical, has not been 
thoroughly investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To assess optimal timing (maternal vs childhood intake) of omega-3 
supplementation for reducing food allergy risk among children in 2 periods (the 
first 3 years and beyond 3 years of age).
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis to assess the effects of maternal or 
childhood omega-3 supplementation on preventing the development of infant food 
allergies and food sensitizations. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web 
of Science databases were searched for related studies published until October 
30, 2022. We conducted dose-response and subgroup analyses to investigate the 
effects of omega-3 supplementation.
RESULTS: We found that maternal omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy and 
lactation was significantly associated with decreased risks of infant egg 
sensitization (relative risk [RR]: 0.58, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 
0.47-0.73, P < .01) and peanut sensitization (RR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80, P < 
.01) among children. Similar results were found in subgroup analyses for food 
allergy, egg sensitization, and peanut sensitization during the first 3 years of 
age and peanut sensitization and cashew nut sensitization beyond 3 years of age. 
Dose-response analysis showed a linear relationship between maternal omega-3 
supplementation and infant egg sensitization risk during early life. By 
contrast, intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid during childhood did not 
appear to significantly protect against food allergies.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy and lactation, 
rather than childhood intake, reduces the risk of infant food allergy and food 
sensitization.

Consumption of nuts and seeds is associated with a range of health outcomes. 
Summarizing the best evidence on essential health outcomes from the consumption 
of nuts is essential to provide optimal recommendations. Our objective is to 
comprehensively assess health outcome associations related to the consumption of 
nuts and seeds, using a culinary definition including tree nuts and peanuts 
(registered in PROSPERO: CRD42021258300). Health outcomes of interest include 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, respiratory disease, 
mortality, and their disease biomarkers. We present associations for high 
compared with low consumption, per serving, and dose-response relations. 
MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos were searched and screened for 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Evidence was extracted from 89 articles on 
the consumption of nuts and relevant health outcomes, including 23 articles with 
meta-analysis on disease and mortality, 66 articles on biomarkers for disease, 
and 9 articles on allergy/adverse outcomes. Intake of nuts was associated with 
reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and related risk factors, with moderate 
quality of evidence. An intake of 28 g/d nuts compared with not eating nuts was 
associated with a 21% RR reduction of cardiovascular disease (including coronary 
heart disease incidence and mortality, atrial fibrillation, and stroke 
mortality), an 11% risk reduction of cancer deaths, and 22% reduction in 
all-cause mortality. Nut consumption was also inversely associated with 
mortality from respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, and diabetes; however, 
associations between nut consumption and diabetes incidence were mixed. 
Meta-analyses of trials on biomarkers for disease generally mirrored 
meta-analyses from observational studies on cardiovascular disease, cancers, and 
diabetes. Allergy and related adverse reactions to nuts were observed in 1-2% of 
adult populations, with substantial heterogeneity between studies. Overall, the 
current evidence supports dietary recommendations to consume a handful of nuts 
and seeds per day for people without allergies to these foods.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy prevalence data have largely been derived from 
self-report, and estimates vary.
OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of physician-reported food allergy in 
children using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care 
Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPSSN).
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the CPCSSN repository, 
Canada's only primary care practice-based surveillance system. Machine learning 
algorithms were applied to assess for food allergy documentation. Demographic 
information, chronic diseases of interest, prescribed medications, and health 
behaviors from the CPCSSN repository were identified.
RESULTS: The prevalence of physician-reported food allergy in Canadian children 
was 2.53% (95% CI, 2.48%-2.59%). The most common food allergies documented were 
peanut (0.8% of children), tree nut (0.6%), cow's milk (0.4%), egg (0.3%), fruit 
(0.2%), finned fish (0.2%), and shellfish (0.2%). Among children with food 
allergy, only 33.7% had an epinephrine autoinjector prescription. In logistic 
regression analysis, children with food allergy were more likely to have an 
atopic comorbidity (odds ratio [OR], 2.20; 95% CI, 2.06-2.35) and less likely to 
be obese than children without food allergies (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). In 
the age- and sex-adjusted models, patients with food allergy were significantly 
more likely to have a psychiatric morbidity, specifically: attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.66-1.96), autism (OR, 1.89; 
95% CI, 1.63-2.19), and depression (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.35).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to estimate national physician-reported 
prevalence of food allergy, and demonstrates a lower rate than that based on 
self-report. Further studies into the association of food allergy and 
psychiatric comorbidities (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, 
depression) and the association of food allergy and obesity are needed.

Diet plays a key role in the maintenance and optimal functioning of immune 
cells. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is an example of a prudent choice of 
lifestyle and scientifically accepted to help preserve human health by 
protecting against major chronic and inflammatory diseases. Mediterranean diets 
(MedDiets) are characteristically high in the consumption of fruits, vegetables 
and salad, bread and whole grain cereals, potatoes, legumes/beans, nuts, and 
seeds. Their common central feature is the usage of olive oil as the main source 
of fat. The health benefits attributed to olive oil are specifically related to 
extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake with its high nutritional quality and 
multiple positive effects on health. Overall, MedDiets have direct 
(mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), tocopherols, polyphenols) and indirect 
(low saturated fats, well-balanced linoleic/alpha linolenic acid) effects on the 
immune system and inflammatory responses. In the present paper, we summarize the 
current knowledge on the effect of olive oil per se and MedDiets generally on 
immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, such as coronary heart disease 
(CHD)/cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, type-2 diabetes, cancer, asthma, 
and allergies.

Milk beverages derived from plant-based protein have attracted the interest of 
consumers and researchers as a health-promoting functional food. It can also be 
considered as a substitute for animal milk due to various allergy concerns 
associated with dairy milk. The plant-based emulsions are directed to prevent 
diet-related chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular, obesity and 
other disorders due to the presence of healthy long-chain unsaturated fatty 
acids as compared to bovine milk. Further, associations between nutritional 
contents (vitamins, minerals and low fat) and pharmacological properties of 
plant-based protein may have extra beneficial effects. The review aims to 
summarize the four different groups of plant sources (nuts, cereals, seeds and 
legumes) used for the preparation of plant-based milk beverages. In addition, it 
also provides a detailed review of the general characteristics and functional 
properties of these plant sources. Physicochemical composition, protein and fats 
quality, functional properties, effect of heat and high-pressure treatment is 
also provided in detail. It also covers fats digestibility, protein stability, 
protein solubility and digestibility. Furthermore, the effect of processing, 
possible comparative study and potential applications in healthcare have been 
discussed.

Diets which emphasize intakes of plant-based foods are recommended to reduce 
disease risk and for promoting healthy weight. The aim of this study was to 
examine the association between fruit, vegetables, pulses and nut intake and 
body mass index (BMI) across countries in adolescents (13-14 years) and children 
(6-7 years). Data from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 
Childhood; 77,243 children's parents and 201,871 adolescents was used to examine 
the association between dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire) and BMI 
using general linear models, adjusting for country gross national index. 
Adolescents who consumed fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts three or more times 
a week had a lower BMI than the never or occasional group; eating nuts three or 
more times a week, was associated with a BMI value of 0.274 kg/m² lower than the 
never group (p < 0.001). Compared to children who never or occasionally reported 
eating vegetables, those reporting that they ate vegetables three or more times 
per week had a lower BMI of -0.079 kg/m². In this large global study, an inverse 
association was observed between BMI and the reported increasing intake of 
vegetables in 6-7 years old and fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts in 
adolescents. This study supports current dietary recommendations which emphasize 
the consumption of vegetables, nut and pulses, although the effect sizes were 
small.

Chronic inflammation is a prolonged and dysregulated immune response leading to 
a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions such as neurological 
abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, pulmonary diseases, 
immunological diseases, cancers, and other life-threatening conditions. 
Therefore, inhibition of persistent inflammation will reduce the risk of 
inflammation-associated chronic diseases. Inflammation-related chronic diseases 
require chronic treatment without side effects. Use of traditional medicines and 
restricted diet has been utilized by mankind for ages to prevent or treat 
several chronic diseases. Bioactive dietary agents or "Nutraceuticals" present 
in several fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fibers, and certain spices have 
shown potential to inhibit or reverse the inflammatory responses and several 
chronic diseases related to chronic inflammation. Due to safe, nontoxic, and 
preventive benefits, the use of nutraceuticals as dietary supplements or 
functional foods has increased in the Western world. Fisetin 
(3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a dietary flavonoid found in various fruits 
(strawberries, apples, mangoes, persimmons, kiwis, and grapes), vegetables 
(tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers), nuts, and wine that has shown strong 
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-tumorigenic, anti-invasive, 
anti-angiogenic, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects in 
cell culture and in animal models relevant to human diseases. In this chapter, 
we discuss the beneficial pharmacological effects of fisetin against different 
pathological conditions with special emphasis on diseases related to chronic 
inflammatory conditions.

Nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are nutrient dense foods with complex matrices rich 
in unsaturated fatty and other bioactive compounds: high-quality vegetable 
protein, fiber, minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds. By 
virtue of their unique composition, nuts are likely to beneficially impact 
health outcomes. Epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a 
reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and gallstones in both genders and 
diabetes in women. Limited evidence also suggests beneficial effects on 
hypertension, cancer, and inflammation. Interventional studies consistently show 
that nut intake has a cholesterol-lowering effect, even in the context of 
healthy diets, and there is emerging evidence of beneficial effects on oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and vascular reactivity. Blood pressure, visceral 
adiposity and the metabolic syndrome also appear to be positively influenced by 
nut consumption. Thus it is clear that nuts have a beneficial impact on many 
cardiovascular risk factors. Contrary to expectations, epidemiologic studies and 
clinical trials suggest that regular nut consumption is unlikely to contribute 
to obesity and may even help in weight loss. Safety concerns are limited to the 
infrequent occurrence of nut allergy in children. In conclusion, nuts are 
nutrient rich foods with wide-ranging cardiovascular and metabolic benefits, 
which can be readily incorporated into healthy diets.

Reactivity to an anisakis allergen component was examined in three patients with 
a history of an anisakiasis anaphylaxis. Case 1, a 38-year-old man, allergic 
symptoms appeared 0.5 hours after ingestion, and the component Ani s 1 and 3 
were positive. Case 2, a 44-year-old woman, allergic symptoms appeared 4 hours 
after ingestion, and components Ani s 3 and 12 were positive. Case 3, a 
36-year-old woman, developed allergic symptoms 7 hours after ingestion of fish 
and shellfish, and tested positive for Ani s 1, 4, and 12. Case 3 reacted 
strongly to both heated and unheated Anisakis extract, while cases 1 and 2 
reacted weakly to heated Anisakis extract. The most common allergen was Ani s 
12, followed by Ani s 1, when analyzed in conjunction with existing reports on 
10 cases. Anisakis IgE was class 3 or higher in all cases. Analysis of 13 cases 
showed 2 cases sensitized to Ani s 4 and moderate or higher anaphylaxis, while 
Ani s 4-sensitized patients were reported to be more likely to develop severe 
disease. It is possible that the patients sensitized to Ani s 4 need to be 
careful about the severity of their allergic symptoms.

Food Chain with Biofunctions and Sustainability: A Review.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that 
more than 500 million people, especially in Asia and Africa, are suffering from 
malnutrition. Recently, livestock farming has increased to supply high-quality 
protein, with consequent impact on the global environment. Alternative food 
sources with high nutritive values that can substitute livestock demands are 
urgently required. Recently, edible crickets have been promoted by the FAO to 
ameliorate the food crisis. In this review, the distribution, nutritive values, 
health-promoting properties (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and 
anti-obesity), safety, allergenicity as well as the potential hazards and risks 
for human consumption are summarized. Cricket farming may help to realize the 
United Nations sustainable development goal No. 2 Zero Hunger. The 
sustainability of cricket farming is also discussed in comparison with other 
livestock. The findings imply that edible crickets are safe for daily intake as 
a healthy alternative diet due to their high protein content and 
health-promoting properties. Appropriate use of edible crickets in the food and 
nutraceutical industries represents a global business potential. However, people 
who are allergic to shellfish should pay attention on cricket allergy. Thus, the 
objective of this review was to present in-depth and up-to-date information on 
edible crickets to advocate and enhance public perception of cricket-based food.

Shellfish, including various species of mollusks (e.g., clams, oysters, and 
mussels) and crustaceans (e.g., shrimp and crab), have been a cornerstone of 
healthy dietary recommendations. However, beyond providing basic nutrition 
needs, their health-promoting effects have been suggested to include 
inflammation reduction and prevention of various chronic 
non-communicableÂ diseases. Currently, studies on the association between 
shellfish consumption and health outcomes have reported conflicting results. The 
present comprehensive review summarized the latest studies on shellfish 
consumption and synthesized the available evidence on the potential health 
benefits or risks of shellfish consumption. The findings demonstrated that 
shellfish consumption may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout but may 
not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and thyroid 
cancer. Adequate evidence is lacking on the association between shellfish 
consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral cancer, 
endometriosis, hip fracture, cognitive function, wheeze, eczema and food 
allergy. Raw shellfish consumption may cause gastroenteritis and other diseases 
infected by bacteria or viruses. This review thus provides consumers and other 
relevant stakeholders with the latest evidence-based information on the 
potential benefits and risks of shellfish consumption.

Wheat and buckwheat allergies are common food allergies that significantly 
impact patients' quality of life and health. Wheat allergy encompasses various 
forms, including wheat food allergy, exercise-induced allergic reactions 
(WDEIA), baker's occupational asthma/allergy, and contact urticaria. 
IgE-mediated allergic reactions involve sensitization to stable wheat allergens 
such as ω-5 gliadin and gluten. Although buckwheat allergy is less common, it is 
gaining attention in certain regions. Allergen component diagnostic 
technologies, by detecting specific allergen components [e.g., ω-5 gliadin, 
gliadins (α, β, γ), and Tri a 14], offer precise allergen source identification, 
aiding in the optimization of diagnosis and management processes. Oral challenge 
tests are considered the gold standard for diagnosing wheat allergy, and 
combining skin prick tests with specific IgE measurements can enhance diagnostic 
accuracy. While avoidance of allergens remains the primary management strategy, 
research into immunotherapy is ongoing. Future research should focus on a deeper 
understanding of the structural and immunological characteristics of wheat and 
buckwheat allergens to develop more accurate diagnostic tools and treatment 
methods, thereby improving allergy management and patient quality of life. This 
article provides a detailed interpretation of the Molecular Allergology User's 
Guide 2.0 (MAUG 2.0) published by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical 
Immunology (EAACI) and recent research advances on wheat and buckwheat 
allergies, highlighting the crucial role of allergen component diagnostics in 
optimizing food allergy diagnosis and treatment processes, supporting clinicians 
in accurately identifying common allergens and their cross-reactivity, and 
formulating more personalized treatment plans for patients.

小麦和荞麦过敏是常见的食物过敏类型，对患者生活质量和健康构成了显著威胁。小麦过敏主要分为小麦食物过敏症、小麦依赖运动诱发的过敏反应（WDEIA）、面包师职业性过敏/哮喘和接触性荨麻疹等多种类型，其中IgE介导的过敏反应包括对稳定的小麦过敏原如ω-5醇溶蛋白和谷蛋白的过敏。荞麦过敏则较为少见，但在某些地区正逐渐受到关注。过敏原分子组分诊断技术通过检测特定过敏原成分，如小麦的ω-5醇溶蛋白、醇溶蛋白（α、β、γ）、Tri 
a 
14等，提供了精确的过敏原识别，帮助优化诊断和管理流程。对于小麦和荞麦过敏，口服激发试验被认为是金标准，结合皮肤点刺试验和特异性IgE检测和病史可以提高诊断准确性。虽然避免过敏原是目前主要的管理策略，但免疫疗法的研发仍在进行中。未来的研究应集中于深入了解小麦和荞麦过敏原的结构与免疫特性，以开发更为精准的诊断工具和治疗方法，从而提升过敏管理的效果和患者的生活质量。本文通过详尽解读欧洲过敏和临床免疫学会（EAACI）发布的《过敏原组分诊断指导建议2.0》（Molecular 
Allergology User′s Guide 2.0，MAUG 
2.0）以及国内外关于小麦和荞麦过敏的研究进展，突显了过敏原组分诊断技术在优化食物过敏诊断与治疗流程中的重要作用，有效辅助临床医生准确识别常见的过敏原及交叉反应，为患者制订更个性化诊疗方案。.

BACKGROUND: The role of immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to food as potential 
triggering factors in allergic disorders continues to be debatable, and is not 
endorsed by most allergy societies.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of specific IgG immune responses to common 
foods in pediatric allergic disorders and any potential relationship between 
them.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on children and adolescents 
diagnosed with allergic disorders at the Ekthar Clinic in Jeddah City. 
Food-specific IgG (FS-IgG) antibody test results were collected from their 
medical records.
RESULTS: Seventy-five children with a mean age of 8.5 years (SD = 5.3) were 
included. The overall allergic diagnosis determined atopic dermatitis as the 
most common (57.3%, 43 participants), followed by food allergy and allergic 
rhinitis (each 40%, 30 participants), and bronchial asthma (29.3%, 22 
participants). Food-specific IgG levels were elevated in all participants. The 
foods with the highest levels of FS-IgG were dairy products (88%: cow's milk 
[86.6%], sour milk [81.3%], sheep's milk [74.7%], cheese [72%], and goat's milk 
[70.7%]), followed by gluten-containing products (81.3%: wheat [70.7%], gluten 
[69.3%], and spelt [66.6%]), and eggs (66.6%). Significant correlations (P < 
0.05) were found between atopic dermatitis and several foods; chronic urticaria 
and chicken and lamb; asthma and ocean perch; allergic rhinitis and rennet 
cheese; and allergic conjunctivitis and potato, pollock, and lamb.
CONCLUSION: Among pediatric allergic disorders, dairy, gluten, and eggs were the 
most detected foods in FS-IgG tests, with some notable correlations with other 
foods. FS-IgG testing may help identify potential triggers in refractory 
allergic disorders.

Background: Urticaria is a common disease with a marked influence on quality of 
life. The key cell involved is the mast cell, which can be activated by a vast 
variety of stimuli, and the major mediator is histamine. Allergic urticaria is a 
disorder with a large variety of causes: food, drugs, insect venom, skin contact 
with allergens, and physical exercise. Buckwheat consumption has increased in 
European countries and the USA because it is gluten-free. It can trigger 
anaphylactic shock if ingested, inhaled, or handled with the hands. Five common 
buckwheat allergens named Fag e1 to 5 (Fag e1, 2, and 3 are considered the major 
allergens) and two tartary buckwheat allergens named Fag t1 and Fag t2 have been 
described. Method: We present the case of a patient who experienced two 
anaphylactic shocks and in whom the etiological factor was buckwheat. The 
patient presented to the Allergology department for the evaluation of two 
episodes of severe allergic reactions that required emergency therapy, episodes 
that involved the loss of consciousness and were of major severity. At each 
anaphylactic shock, an ambulance was requested, and emergency therapy was 
administered, leading to the patient's recovery within a few hours. Diagnosis: 
Since each episode occurred a few minutes after eating, the diagnosis was 
established based on a detailed anamnesis and prick skin tests, followed by 
specific IgE dosages. Other foods consumed by the patient, assessed by prick 
skin testing and specific IgE dosages of suspected foods, were excluded as the 
etiological cause. Increased levels of buckwheat-specific immunoglobulin E were 
highlighted, thus identifying the etiological agent. The treatment of 
anaphylactic shock was performed urgently by the ambulance crew with adrenaline, 
infusion solutions, cortisone preparations, and antihistamines. Result: 
Following the treatment that was initiated, there was a partial remission of the 
lesions after a few hours. Conclusions: Buckwheat allergy is rare, but it 
produces symptoms that affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory 
tract, as well as anaphylaxis. In a professional environment, it can trigger 
allergic rhinitis, asthma, and hives. Although buckwheat allergens have been 
described, their clinical relevance has only been studied in a small number 
cases. In current practice, the only commercially available allergen is Beech e2 
per the ImmunoCAP ISAC microarray. Diagnosis can be difficult in clinical 
practice. This reported case suggests the need for a thorough anamnesis, since 
buckwheat is consumed as a hidden allergen, and in Europe, it is not necessary 
to label foods containing this allergen.

IgE-mediated wheat allergy can take on various forms, including childhood food 
allergy to wheat, wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis in young adults, 
baker's respiratory allergy/asthma in workers exposed to wheat flour inhalation, 
and contact urticaria that is caused by hydrolyzed wheat proteins in some 
cosmetics, and that is sometimes associated with a food allergy. Singleplex and 
multiplex immunoassays detect specific IgE antibodies to wheat allergenic 
molecular biomarkers such as omega-5 gliadin Tri a 19, lipid transfer protein 
Tri a 14, and alpha-amylase inhibitors. The fluorescence enzyme immunoassay with 
capsulated cellulose polymer solid-phase coupled allergens is a commonly used 
singleplex assay. Multiplex methods include the ELISA-based macroarray 
immunoassay using nano-bead technology and a microarray immunoassay on 
polymer-coated slides. Another promising diagnostic tool is the basophil 
activation test performed with omega-5 gliadin and other wheat protein types. 
Detailed comprehension of the structural and immunological features of the 
numerous wheat allergens significant in clinical settings is imperative for 
advancing diagnostic biomarkers for IgE-mediated wheat allergies.

Background: Celiac disease, a gluten-triggered autoimmune disorder, is known for 
its systemic inflammatory effects. Its genetic associations with type 2 
inflammatory diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis 
remain unclear, prompting this study to explore their potential genetic 
interplay. Methods: Utilizing two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR), we 
examined the genetic associations using 15 genetic instruments from GWAS 
datasets. Our analysis focused on celiac disease and its relation to asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and IgE-mediated food allergies. A power 
analysis was conducted to determine the study's detection capabilities, and odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using various 
MR methods. Results: Our Mendelian randomization analysis identified 
statistically significant genetic associations between celiac disease and 
several type 2 inflammatory diseases, although these were practically 
insignificant. Specifically, celiac disease was associated with a slight 
increase in the risk of atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.037) and a minor protective 
effect against asthma (OR = 0.97). The link with allergic rhinitis was 
statistically detectable (OR = 1.002) but practically negligible. Despite robust 
statistical confirmation through various sensitivity analyses, all observed 
effects remained within the range of practical equivalence (ROPE). Conclusions: 
Our study identifies potential genetic associations between celiac disease and 
certain type 2 inflammatory diseases. However, these associations, predominantly 
within the ROPE range, suggest only limited clinical implications. These 
findings highlight the need for cautious interpretation and indicate that 
further exploration for clinical applications may not be warranted at this 
stage.

BACKGROUND: The burden of dietary restrictions includes the high cost and 
limited availability of allergen-friendly products which disproportionately 
affects people with food insecurity.
OBJECTIVE: To better understand access to allergen-friendly food for college 
students experiencing food insecurity with food allergies or other diet-treated 
conditions by surveying college campus food pantries.
METHODS: A total of 120 randomly selected US colleges/universities were 
recruited to complete FOODiversity's Food Insecurity Questionnaire about campus 
food pantry operations, dietary restrictions, and food-insecurity initiatives 
and provide details about their resources and training dedicated to supporting 
food-insecure young adults who avoid specific food(s).
RESULTS: Of the respondents, 48% ask students about dietary restrictions at food 
pantry intake, 37% track the number of patrons with restrictions, 30% process 
allergen-friendly product requests, 17% train staff about dietary restrictions, 
and 4% modify processes to accommodate dietary restrictions. Of the 48% who 
inquire about dietary restrictions, follow-up interventions vary in levels of 
accommodation. Dairy-free and gluten-free products are most frequently 
requested, and gluten-free products are the most donated/stocked and most 
difficult to accommodate.
CONCLUSION: Food pantries play a critical role in reducing the burden 
experienced by food-insecure individuals; however, most pantries are unable to 
provide sufficient accommodations for clients with food allergies or other 
diet-treated conditions, including staff training, provision of 
allergen-friendly products, or identifying food-insecure college students with 
dietary restrictions, and promoting food allergy safety and nutritional impacts.

(1) Background. Coeliac disease (CD) often co-occurs with autoimmune conditions 
or genetic syndromes, but there are few studies on the co-existence of CD and 
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergies. The purpose of this study was to 
assess sensitization to food and aero-allergens in pediatric patients with CD. 
(2) Methods. A multiplex ALEX®2 test was used to determine specific IgEs 
(sIgEs). (3) Results. The study included 108 children newly diagnosed with CD. 
Allergen extract- and/or allergen molecule-sIgEs were detected in 49.1% of 
children. Most children (41.5%) were sensitized to both inhalant and food 
allergens. The three most common aero-allergens (timothy pollen, ryegrass, 
silver birch) were molecules Phl p 1, Lol p 1, and Bet v 1. The most common food 
allergens (hazelnut, apple, and peanut) were Cor a 1, Mal d 1, and Ara h 8 
molecules of the PR-10 subfamily. Patients were not sensitized to cereal 
allergens containing gluten. Spearman's rank correlation analysis of sensitized 
patients showed a significant positive relationship (r = 0.31) between the 
patients' age and the occurrence of positive sIgEs (≥0.3 kUA/L) for inhalant 
allergen molecules (p = 0.045). In sensitized patients, mainly symptoms of 
inhalant allergy were observed, such as hay fever, conjunctivitis, and bronchial 
asthma. (4) Conclusions. The current study indicates the co-occurrence of IgE 
sensitization to food and inhalant allergens in children with CD. The study 
highlights the need to take a closer look at the diagnosis of IgE-mediated 
allergy in patients with CD, which may help in their care and lead to a better 
understanding of the relationship between CD and IgE-mediated allergy.

BACKGROUND: Wheat allergy (WA), characterized by immunological responses to 
wheat proteins, is a gluten-related disorder that has become increasingly 
recognized in recent years. Bibliometrics involves the quantitative assessment 
of publications within a specific academic domain.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to execute an extensive bibliometric study, focusing on the 
past 30 years of literature related to wheat allergy.
METHODS: We searched the Web of Science database on 5th Dec 2023. We used the 
keywords "wheat allergy or wheat anaphylaxis or wheat hypersensitivity," 
"gliadin allergy or gliadin anaphylaxis or gliadin hypersensitivity," 
"wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis," and "baker's asthma" for our 
search. All items published between 1993 and 2023 were included. The top 100 
most cited articles were identified and analyzed.
RESULTS: Our study conducted an in-depth bibliometric analysis of the 100 
most-cited articles in the field of wheat allergy, published between 2002 and 
2019. These articles originated from 20 different countries, predominantly Japan 
and Germany. The majority of these articles were centered on the pathogenesis 
and treatment of wheat allergy (WA). The Journal of Allergy and Clinical 
Immunology (JACI) was the most prolific contributor to this list, publishing 14 
articles. The article with the highest citation count was published by Biomed 
Central (BMC) and garnered 748 citations. The peak citation year was 2015, with 
a total of 774 citations, while the years 1998, 2001, and 2005 saw the highest 
publication frequency, each with 7 articles.
CONCLUSION: Our study aims to provide physicians and researchers with a 
historical perspective for the scientific progress of wheat allergy, and help 
clinicians effectively obtain useful articles that have a significant impact on 
the field of wheat allergy.

BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic gastritis (EoG) has rarely been reported in conjunction 
with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE). When this does occur, patients 
typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms. To our knowledge, 
hypoproteinemia has not been reported as the primary manifestation. Anti-IgE 
therapy, such as omalizumab, lowers eosinophil counts in the blood, lungs, and 
gut. Its efficiency in treating active EoG remain unknown.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 33-month-old boy with a history of food allergy 
and atopic dermatitis who developed recurrent edema, hypoproteinemia, and 
eosinophilia at the age of 14 months. The diagnoses of EoG and GSE were 
confirmed based on the clinical presentation and results of gastrointestinal 
biopsies and serological testing. Although prednisone and dietary intervention 
were initially effective, the boy developed prednisone-related facial swelling. 
After stopping prednisone, his symptoms relapsed. Subsequent treatment with 
omalizumab, combined with dietary intervention, showed good efficacy and safety.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case of concurrent EoG and GSE 
that presented primarily with hypoproteinemia. We highlight the rare 
manifestations of these two diseases to raise clinical suspicion and prevent 
missed and delayed diagnoses. The pathogenesis of EoG is heterogeneous and 
complex. Omalizumab showed good efficacy, indicating that IgE-mediated processes 
may be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's diseases.

BACKGROUND: Food allergies including cofactor-dependent allergies such as 
cofactor-dependent wheat allergy (CDWA) decrease the quality of life (QOL) of 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: To define the health-related QOL and fears in patients with CDWA and 
to evaluate the impact of diagnosis confirmation by oral challenge test (OCT).
METHODS: Patients with CDWA diagnosed by clinical history, sensitization, and 
OCT were invited to participate. Clinical characteristics, patients' fears, 
self-perceived overall QOL, the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Adult 
Form score, and the risks and benefits of OCT were evaluated after the final 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 22 adults with CDWA (13 male, 9 female; mean age 53.5 years; 
median 5 years until diagnosis) were included. Specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
levels for gluten proteins were inversely correlated with the reaction threshold 
(P < .05). Higher reaction severity in the patients' histories correlated with 
increased basal serum tryptase levels (P = .003) and gluten and gliadin specific 
IgE (P < .05), but not to QOL. After the first allergic reaction, patients 
reported a drop in QOL (P < .001). Challenge-confirmed diagnosis and medical 
consultation could restore the patients' QOL (P < .05) and reduce their fear of 
further reactions (P < .01). No severe reactions occurred during OCT, which was 
rated as not stressful and highly beneficial. Compared with patients with CDWA 
diagnosed without OCT in the literature, health-related QOL was less impaired 
(mean Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Adult Form score 3.8), 
especially regarding the emotional impact (P < .001 vs existing literature).
CONCLUSION: Until final diagnosis, patients with CDWA have a severe physical and 
psychological burden. OCT is a safe method to confirm the diagnosis, restore the 
patients' severely affected QOL, and reduce their fear of further reactions.

BACKGROUND: Severe anaphylactic reactions to home doses may occur during food 
allergy oral immunotherapy (OIT).
OBJECTIVE: To study the rate and risk factors for such reactions.
METHODS: We studied all patients aged greater than 3.5 years who completed OIT 
in a single center between April 2010 and January 2020. All home 
epinephrine-treated reactions (HETRs) were identified. High-grade HETRs 
(HG-HETRs) were defined as HETRs involving respiratory (SpO2 of 94% or less), 
cardiovascular (low blood pressure), or central nervous system impairment (loss 
of consciousness). We investigated the rate and risk factors for HG-HETRs.
RESULTS: A total of 1,637 OIT treatments were studied: milk (880), peanut (346), 
tree nuts (221), sesame (115), and egg (75). Of 390 identified HETRs, 30 
HG-HETRs occurred during 27 treatments (1.65% of all treatments). Nearly all (26 
of 30) were during milk OIT in patients with house dust mite (HDM) sensitization 
and asthma (26 of 30 each). Of the 30 patients with HG-HETRs, 21 recovered with 
one or two epinephrine treatments, but nine (0.55% of all treatments) did not 
respond to a second dose of epinephrine and were deemed to have refractory 
anaphylaxis. Three patients required intensive care unit admission and three 
received epinephrine drip, but none required ventilatory support. Risk factors 
for HG-HETRs included milk OIT (P = .031), asthma (P = .02) and HDM 
sensitization (P = .02). No specific triggers for HG-HETR were identified. Of 
patients with HG-HETRs, 25.9% were fully desensitized, including the four 
non-milk treated patients; 22.2% were partially desensitized; and 51.9% failed.
CONCLUSIONS: High-grade HETRs are uncommon, particularly refractory anaphylactic 
reactions to home OIT doses. Although milk OIT, asthma, and HDM sensitization 
are the main risk factors for such reactions, identification of patients who are 
at risk is challenging.

Tree nut along with peanut are among the most potent food allergens, responsible 
for frequently inducing the IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Our aim was 
identification, purification of Buchanania lanzan (Bl-11 kDa) protein along with 
characterization and assessment of allergenic potential of clinically relevant 
allergen. Further study was executed in clinical samples of sensitive patients, 
BALB/c mice, and in-vitro. A major IgE binding 11-kDa protein from Buchanania 
lanzan was purified by anion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high 
pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and characterized using peptide mass 
fingerprinting (PMF). Buchanania lanzan (Bl-11 kDa) protein shows the pepsin 
resistance and depicts IgE interacting capacity to Buchanania lanzan allergic 
patient's sera as well as sensitized mice sera. It also showed increase in the 
allergic mediator's like IgE, IgG1, histamine levels in sensitized mice sera. 
Further study was carried out in-vitro (RBL-2H3 cells) and increased release 
mast cell degranulation mediators such as β-hexosaminidase, histamine, CysL and 
PGD2 in the culture supernatant was found. The activation of Th2 
cytokines/transcription factors and expression of molecular markers in the 
downstream of mast cell signaling were up-regulated while the Th1 
transcriptional factor (T-bet) was decreased in Bl-11 kDa protein treated mice. 
Conclusively, our study demonstrates Buchanania lanzan purified protein to be 
potential allergen that may generate an allergic reaction in sensitized 
individuals, and one of the most important IgE binding protein responsible for 
its allergenicity.

The genus of Pistacia plant systematically fits into the family of 
Anacardiaceae. Pistachios contain protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibers, fat, 
folic acid, vitamin K, magnesium and potassium, gama-tocopherols, 
phytochemicals, and polyphenols. Collectively, these constituents have been 
shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions to improve overall 
health when consumed as a healthy diet. We searched the following keywords 
within the literature databases: pistachio, heart disorders, lipids, weight, 
antioxidants, and allergy. Further searching theses keywords, we have found 50 
articles in PubMed, 40 articles in ISI web of knowledge and 30 articles in 
Google Scholar. We have selected 100 articles, among them 80 articles were used 
as the references of this review. In the current article, we have discussed the 
most recent data published regarding the regulatory effects of pistachios on 
several clinical states such as heart related disorders, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, vascular stiffness and endothelial and gut functions, weight 
management, glucose metabolism, kidney function and finally allergies.

Objective To prospectively examine the relation between the Dietary Approaches 
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Western diets and risk of gout (ie, the clinical 
endpoint of hyperuricemia) in men.Design Prospective cohort study.Setting The 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study.Participants 44 444 men with no history of 
gout at baseline. Using validated food frequency questionnaires, each 
participant was assigned a DASH dietary pattern score (based on high intake of 
fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low fat dairy products, and whole grains, 
and low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats) and 
a Western dietary pattern score (based on high intake of red and processed 
meats, French fries, refined grains, sweets, and desserts).Main outcome 
measure Risk of incident gout meeting the preliminary American College of 
Rheumatology survey criteria for gout, adjusting for potential confounders, 
including age, body mass index, hypertension, diuretic use, and alcohol 
intake.Results During 26 years of follow-up, 1731 confirmed cases of incident 
gout were documented. A higher DASH dietary pattern score was associated with a 
lower risk for gout (adjusted relative risk for extreme fifths 0.68, 95% 
confidence interval 0.57 to 0.80, P value for trend <0.001). In contrast, a 
higher Western dietary pattern score was associated with an increased risk for 
gout (1.42, 1.16 to 1.74, P=0.005).Conclusion The DASH diet is associated with a 
lower risk of gout, suggesting that its effect of lowering uric acid levels in 
individuals with hyperuricemia translates to a lower risk of gout. Conversely, 
the Western diet is associated with a higher risk of gout. The DASH diet may 
provide an attractive preventive dietary approach for men at risk of gout.

Peanut represents one of the most harmful allergenic foods capable of triggering 
severe and sometimes lethal reactions in allergic consumers upon ingestion of 
even small amounts. Several proteins capable of inducing allergic reactions that 
have been recognised by patients' IgE antibodies have been identified from this 
nut source. Methods mainly based on ELISA assays have been developed in order to 
detect peanuts in several food commodities. In addition LC-MS/MS methods based 
on different mass analysers have also been devised for tracing peanut 
contamination in different foods achieving low limits of detection. The 
applicability of a benchtop high-resolution Exactive™ mass spectrometer has 
never been investigated for the rapid screening of peanut contamination in 
complex food matrices like mixtures of nuts. We report in this paper the design 
of suitable peanut markers and the development of an high-resolution Orbitrap™ 
mass spectrometer-based method for peanut detection in a mixture of nuts 
species. With this aim, different types of samples were prepared: (1) nuts-based 
powder made up of a mixture of hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds and walnuts; and 
(2) nuts powder fortified with peanuts. Different levels of fortifications were 
produced and the applicability of the method was tested. Finally, a subset of 
six peptides fulfilling specific analytical requirements was chosen to check the 
suitability of the method tailored to the detection of peanuts in nuts-based 
products, and two of them, peptides VYD and WLG, were selected as quantitative 
markers. The method proved to be a suitable screening tool to assess the 
presence of traces of peanuts in other tree nuts with a limit of detection as 
low as 4 µg of peanuts proteins or 26 µg of peanuts in 1 g of matrix.

Nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are nutrient dense foods with complex matrices rich 
in unsaturated fatty and other bioactive compounds: high-quality vegetable 
protein, fiber, minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds. By 
virtue of their unique composition, nuts are likely to beneficially impact 
health outcomes. Epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a 
reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and gallstones in both genders and 
diabetes in women. Limited evidence also suggests beneficial effects on 
hypertension, cancer, and inflammation. Interventional studies consistently show 
that nut intake has a cholesterol-lowering effect, even in the context of 
healthy diets, and there is emerging evidence of beneficial effects on oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and vascular reactivity. Blood pressure, visceral 
adiposity and the metabolic syndrome also appear to be positively influenced by 
nut consumption. Thus it is clear that nuts have a beneficial impact on many 
cardiovascular risk factors. Contrary to expectations, epidemiologic studies and 
clinical trials suggest that regular nut consumption is unlikely to contribute 
to obesity and may even help in weight loss. Safety concerns are limited to the 
infrequent occurrence of nut allergy in children. In conclusion, nuts are 
nutrient rich foods with wide-ranging cardiovascular and metabolic benefits, 
which can be readily incorporated into healthy diets.

Recent epidemiologic studies have associated nut consumption with a reduced 
incidence of cardiovascular mortality. However, little is known about the 
contribution of nut polyphenols to antioxidant and cardiovascular protection. In 
this investigation, polyphenol-rich extracts from English walnuts (Juglans 
regia) were studied and compared with ellagic acid for their ability to inhibit 
in vitro plasma and LDL oxidation, as well as their effects on LDL 
alpha-tocopherol during oxidative stress. In addition, the Trolox equivalent 
antioxidant activity (TEAC) was determined and liquid chromatography 
electrospray detection mass spectrometry (LC-ELSD/MS) analyses of the walnut 
extracts were performed. 2,2'-Azobis'(2-amidino propane) hydrochloride 
(AAPH)-induced LDL oxidation was significantly inhibited by 87 and 38% with the 
highest concentration (1.0 micromol/L) of ellagic acid and walnut extract, 
respectively. In addition, copper-mediated LDL oxidation was inhibited by 14 and 
84% in the presence of ellagic acid and walnut extract, respectively, with a 
modest, significant LDL alpha-tocopherol sparing effect observed. Plasma 
thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (TBARS) formation was significantly 
inhibited by walnut extracts and ellagic acid in a dose-dependent manner, and 
the extracts exhibited a TEAC value greater than that of alpha-tocopherol. 
LC-ELSD/MS analysis of the walnut extracts identified ellagic acid monomers, 
polymeric ellagitannins and other phenolics, principally nonflavonoid compounds. 
These results demonstrate that walnut polyphenolics are effective inhibitors of 
in vitro plasma and LDL oxidation. The polyphenolic content of walnuts should be 
considered when evaluating their antiatherogenic potential.

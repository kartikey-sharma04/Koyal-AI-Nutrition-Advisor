3D food printing (3DFP) offers a transformative approach in the food industry, 
diverging from traditional manufacturing techniques. The integration of food 
science and nutrition with 3DFP is pioneering personalized, eco-friendly, and 
nutrient-rich food options, overcoming limitations of traditional manufacturing 
methods. For the past 10 years, we have been strongly focused on creating 
innovative, efficient, and functional food products while allowing customization 
of food based on preferences for nutrition, flavor, texture, mouthfeel, and 
appearance. Beyond customization, 3DFP demonstrates promise in addressing 
pressing global challenges including food security, famine, and malnutrition by 
facilitating the production of fortified, shelf-stable food products suitable 
for resource- constrained environments. This comprehensive review explores the 
intersection of 3DFP with food constituents, emphasizing its potential in 
enhancing customization, sustainability, food safety, and shelf-life extension. 
Additionally, it discusses the therapeutic potential of 3D printed foods for 
various diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, diabetes, 
neurodegenerative disorders, and food allergies. Moreover, the review examines 
potential food applications of 3DFP, such as in space food, food packaging, 
dairy industry, fruit and vegetable processing, and cereal-based foods. The 
review also addresses key challenges associated with 3DFP and underscores the 
importance of four-dimensional food printing (4DFP).

Milk is a highly complex food that contains all the nutrients necessary for the 
development of mammalian offspring. For millennia, humans have included milk and 
milk products as major components of their diet. However, the effect of the 
consumption of dairy products on health has been a concern in recent years in 
terms of myths and realities. This review briefly describes the composition of 
bovine milk, the positive and negative effects that have been related to dairy 
products, and those aspects where the scientific evidence is still inconclusive. 
In addition to being nutritional, dairy products are a source of bioactive 
peptides, prebiotics and probiotics, fatty acids such as CLA, and fat globule 
membranes or have a protective effect against certain diseases. Negative effects 
include milk protein allergy or lactose intolerance. The effects of dairy 
products on certain cancers, such as prostate cancer, and their role in type II 
diabetes mellitus or weight gain are still inconclusive. Although the role of 
dairy products in cardiovascular risk is still inconclusive, recent 
meta-analyses have shown that dairy products may have a protective effect.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Iodine deficiency hypothyroidism is an important cause of 
neurocognitive and motor impairment in children globally. In the United States, 
universal salt iodization, which began in the 1920s, led to a dramatic decline 
in iodine deficiency hypothyroidism. However, iodine deficiency may be 
reemerging due to increased consumption of noniodized salts, decreased dairy 
iodine concentrations, and decreased intake of iodine containing foods due to 
food allergies, dietary preferences such as vegan diets, or restrictive food 
intake disorders.
CASE REPORT: We present a case series that challenges the existing clinical 
paradigm for hypothyroidism and describe 3 patients without underlying thyroid 
dysfunction who were diagnosed with iodine deficiency hypothyroidism over an 
18-month period beginning in February 2021 in Northeastern United States. Prior 
studies reported 2 additional cases diagnosed in that same time frame at our 
clinical center.
DISCUSSION: We report significant heterogeneity in clinical presentation: 3 
patients had large goiters, 1 had a mild goiter, and 1 patient had no goiter. 
Biochemical tests were also variable and included a wide range of thyroid 
stimulating hormone elevations.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that a spot urine iodine concentration, combined with an 
elevated serum thyroglobulin level, can be an alternative to a 24-hour urinary 
iodine excretion for the diagnosis of iodine deficiency hypothyroidism given the 
clinical challenges of obtaining the latter. Thyroid function normalized in all 
patients with iodine supplementation.

Fermented fruits and vegetables are rich in phenolic compounds, minerals, and 
vitamins, which have potential health benefits for the prevention of many 
diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. There is a growing 
demand for the development of nondairy probiotic products based on fruits and 
vegetables in view of changing lifestyles (e.g., vegetarianism, veganism, and 
allergy to dairy products) and the rise of nutritional diet therapy. In this 
review, the processes and health potential of fermented fruits and vegetables 
are described. The study focuses on the role of bacteria and fungi in fermented 
fruits and vegetables, outlines the process of transformation of bioactive 
components, and systematically summarizes the possible mechanisms of 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and blood pressure-lowering effects. The health 
effects of fermented fruits and vegetables depend mainly on the microorganisms 
present in the fermentation process and the bioactive components they produce, 
such as phenols, vitamins, and organic acids. These active compounds exert many 
health effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, 
hypotensive, hypoglycemic, and other health benefits. Therefore, the development 
of fermented foods based on fruits and vegetables can be a promising way to 
adapt to the market demand and to reduce the wastage of agriculturally produced 
fruits and vegetables.

Cats are increasingly favored as companion animals; their health has drawn 
widespread attention. Given the continuous improvements in the required living 
standards of both humans and animals, inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, 
diarrhea, constipation, periodontal disease, obesity, diabetes, and other health 
issues have become recognized as valid pet problems. Antibiotics are commonly 
used to treat pet diseases, greatly improving animal health. However, antibiotic 
abuse is common, especially when seeking to treat bacterial infections. 
Probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that may be directly ingested in food 
or as feed additives; they improve the intestinal microflora balance, enhance 
immunity, and ensure healthy growth. However, cat data are usually inferred from 
reports on dogs or humans; cat research remains preliminary in nature. 
Therefore, we here describe the current understanding of how probiotics improve 
cat health, facilitating the further development and application of probiotics 
for cats.

PURPOSE: Cow's milk is one of the most hydrating beverages, but many individuals 
choose not to consume dairy in their diet due to intolerance, allergy, or 
dietary preference. Milk is commonly replaced with plant-based beverages, 
including soya which has the most comparable protein content, but little is 
known about their hydration potential. This study compared fluid and electrolyte 
balance responses between a soya beverage and skimmed cow's milk.
METHODS: Ten healthy males [age 27 (6) y; body mass index 24.6 (2.3) kg/m2] 
completed two randomised counterbalanced trials, involving consuming 1000 mL 
water from approximately isocaloric amounts of skimmed cow's milk (MILK) or a 
sweetened soya beverage (SOYA), in four aliquots over 30 min in a euhydrated 
fasted state. Volume, specific gravity, and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, 
chloride) concentrations were determined in total-void urine samples collected 
pre-/post-beverage ingestion, and hourly for 180 min thereafter. Hunger, thirst, 
nausea and stomach fullness were rated proximal to urine samples.
RESULTS: Total urine mass (MILK, 986 ± 254 g; SOYA, 950 ± 248 g; P = 0.435) and 
urine specific gravity (P = 0.156) did not differ between trials. Potassium 
balance was greater in SOYA 0-180 min post-beverage (P ≤ 0.013), whilst chloride 
balance was greater in MILK 0-120 min post-beverage (P ≤ 0.036). Sodium balance 
(P = 0.258), total electrolyte balance (P = 0.258), and subjective measures 
(P ≥ 0.139) were not different between trials.
CONCLUSION: Replacing cow's milk with a soya beverage did not negatively impact 
fluid balance in healthy young males, making it a viable option for those who 
choose not to consume dairy in their diet.

Fermentation is thought to be born in the Fertile Crescent, and since then, 
almost every culture has integrated fermented foods into their dietary habits. 
Originally used to preserve foods, fermentation is now applied to improve their 
physicochemical, sensory, nutritional, and safety attributes. Fermented dairy, 
alcoholic beverages like wine and beer, fermented vegetables, fruits, and meats 
are all highly valuable due to their increased storage stability, reduced risk 
of food poisoning, and enhanced flavor. Over the years, scientific research has 
associated the consumption of fermented products with improved health status. 
The fermentation process helps to break down compounds into more easily 
digestible forms. It also helps to reduce the amount of toxins and pathogens in 
food. Additionally, fermented foods contain probiotics, which are beneficial 
bacteria that help the body to digest food and absorb nutrients. In today's 
world, non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 
diabetes, cancer, and allergies have increased. In this regard, scientific 
investigations have demonstrated that shifting to a diet that contains fermented 
foods can reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. Moreover, in the last 
decade, there has been a growing interest in fermentation technology to valorize 
food waste into valuable by-products. Fermentation of various food wastes has 
resulted in the successful production of valuable by-products, including 
enzymes, pigments, and biofuels.

Consumers' growing interest in using foods that improve health has motivated 
researchers and the food industry to develop new functional products, such as 
foods containing probiotics or live microbes. Probiotics have functional 
attributes that could satisfy most basic nutritional and therapeutic 
supplementation requirements. These microbes positively respond to clinical 
therapies against diseases and illnesses such as rotavirus-associated diarrhea, 
irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies. Moreover, the role of probiotics 
in the prevention and treatment of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and diseases 
related to pathogenic microbes is an exciting and rapidly advancing research 
arena. Probiotic supplementation usually involves dairy products. However, 
because of the growing number of individuals affected by lactose intolerance 
and/or vegans, other food matrices like fruits, vegetables, cereals, and so on, 
have been studied as potential carriers for these microorganisms, presenting an 
alternative and better source in the process of assessing novel probiotic 
strains. The present review discusses the various factors affecting the survival 
of probiotics during storage in fruit juices, the possible effect of probiotics 
on sensory attributes and the overall acceptance of the products, and future 
technologies to improve the viability of probiotics.

Flavonoids effectively treat cancer, inflammatory disorders (cardiovascular and 
nervous systems), and oxidative stress. Fisetin, derived from fruits and 
vegetables, suppresses cancer growth by altering cell cycle parameters that lead 
to cell death and angiogenesis without affecting healthy cells. Clinical trials 
are needed in humans to prove the effectiveness of this treatment for a wide 
range of cancers. According to the results of this study, fisetin can be used to 
prevent and treat a variety of cancers. Despite early detection and treatment 
advances, cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. We must take proactive 
steps to reduce the risk of cancer. The natural flavonoid fisetin has 
pharmacological properties that suppress cancer growth. This review focuses on 
the potential drug use of fisetin, which has been extensively explored for its 
cancer-fighting ability and other pharmacological activities such as diabetes, 
COVID-19, obesity, allergy, neurological, and bone disorders. Researchers have 
focused on the molecular function of fisetin. In this review, we have 
highlighted the biological activities against chronic disorders, including 
cancer, metabolic illnesses, and degenerative illnesses, of the dietary 
components of fisetin.

Camel milk is known for its exceptional medical uses. It has been used since 
ancient times to treat infant diarrhea, hepatitis, insulin-dependent diabetes 
(IDDM), lactose intolerance, alcohol-induced liver damage, allergies, and 
autism. It has the power to treat several diseases, with cancer being the most 
significant. This study investigated the evolutionary relationship, 
physiochemical characteristics, and comparative genomic analysis of the casein 
gene family (CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN1S2, and CSN3) in Camelus ferus. Molecular 
phylogenetics showing the camelid species clustered casein nucleotide sequences 
into four groups: CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN1S2, and CSN3. The casein proteins from 
camels were evaluated and found to be unstable, thermostable, and hydrophilic. 
CSN1S2, CSN2, and CSN3 were acidic, but CSN1S1 was basic. CSN1S1 showed positive 
selection for one amino acid (Q), CSN1S2 and CSN2 for three (T, K, Q), and CSN3 
showed no positive selection. We also compared high-milk-output species such as 
cattle (Bos Tarus) and low-milk-yield species such as sheep (Ovies Aries) with 
camels (Camel ferus) and discovered that YY1 sites are more frequent in sheep 
than in camels and very low in cattle. We concluded that the ratio of YY1 sites 
in these species may affect milk production.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is a significant health 
issue in the pediatric age, carrying lifelong health implications. To compare 
the impact of different formulas on the occurrence of other atopic 
manifestations (AMs), autoimmune disorders (ADs) and the time of immune 
tolerance acquisition in a population of children with immunoglobulin E 
(IgE)-mediated cow CMPA.
METHODS: In a 72-month prospective cohort study the occurrence of other AMs 
(i.e., eczema, urticaria, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis), ADs (i.e., celiac 
disease, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, idiopathic 
juvenile arthritis) and the time of immune tolerance acquisition were 
comparatively evaluated in IgE-mediated CMPA children treated with different 
formulas: extensively hydrolyzed casein formula containing the probiotic 
L. rhamnosus G (EHCF + LGG), rice hydrolyzed formula (RHF), soy formula (SF), 
extensively hydrolyzed whey formula (EHWF), or amino-acid based formula (AAF).
RESULTS: 313 subjects were evaluated: EHCF + LGG (n = 64), RHF(n = 62), 
SF(n = 63), EHWF(n = 60) and AAF (n = 64). The incidence of AMs was: 
0.30(Bonferroni-corrected 95%CI 0.15 to 0.44) for EHCF + LGG cohort, 0.68 
(0.52-0.83) for RHF cohort, 0.73 (0.59-0.87) for SF cohort, 0.70 (0.55-0.85) for 
EHWF cohort and 0.83 (0.71-0.95) for AAF cohort. The corresponding risk ratios 
are 2.28 (1.51-3.45) for RHF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.46 (1.64-3.69) for SF 
vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001), 2.36 (1.56-3.56) for EHWF vs. EHCF + LGG 
(p < 0.001), and 2.79 (1.88-4.13) for AAF vs. EHCF + LGG (p < 0.001). The 
72-month immune tolerance acquisition rate was higher in the EHCF + LGG cohort. 
The incidence of celiac disease was 2/313 (0.006, binomial exact 95%CI 0.0007 to 
0.023). No cases of other ADs were reported.
CONCLUSION: The dietary treatment with EHCF + LGG is associated with lower 
incidence of AMs and higher rate of immune tolerance acquisition in children 
with CMPA.

Gluten and soy allergies are significant health concerns, particularly in 
individuals with celiac disease or soy sensitivity. While dietary sources of 
these allergens are well-studied, their presence in medicinal products remains 
under-explored. This study assessed the prevalence of gluten and soy-derived 
excipients in 308 medicinal products authorized for marketing in Portugal. A 
systematic search of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) database was 
conducted for 108 analgesics and antipyretics containing paracetamol, 85 NSAIDs 
containing ibuprofen, and 115 antiasthmatic and bronchodilator medicinal 
products. The study found significant associations between pharmacotherapeutic 
groups and the presence of these allergens (p < 0.001). Gluten was more 
prevalent in the group of analgesics and antipyretics (44.4%) than in NSAIDs 
(8.2%), whereas soy-derived excipients were more frequent in NSAIDs (14%) than 
in analgesics and antipyretics (6.5%). No excipients containing gluten or soy 
were identified in antiasthmatic and bronchodilator medicinal products. In 
analgesics and antipyretics, 51.2% of solid oral dosage forms and 40% of liquid 
oral formulations contained gluten. Within the NSAIDs group, gluten was mainly 
present in liquid oral dosage forms (26.7%). Soy-derived excipients were found 
in 30% of liquid oral formulations and in 33.3% of rectal dosage forms of 
analgesics and antipyretics. In the NSAIDs group, soy was more prevalent in 
liquid oral formulations (26.7%). These findings highlight the need for clearer 
labeling of allergens in medicinal products and underscore the importance of 
vigilance for patients with gluten or soy allergies. Further research is 
required to address gaps in allergen disclosure by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
and to promote safer medicinal product use for sensitive populations. Enhanced 
awareness among healthcare providers and patients is essential to mitigate the 
risk of allergic reactions associated with hidden excipients in medicinal 
products.

INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis and management of cow's milk allergy (CMA) is a 
topic of debate and controversy. Our aim was to compare the opinions of expert 
groups from the Middle East (n = 14) and the European Society of Paediatric 
Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) (n = 13).
METHODS: These Expert groups voted on statements that were developed by the 
ESPGHAN group and published in a recent position paper. The voting outcome was 
compared.
RESULTS: Overall, there was consensus amongst both groups of experts. Experts 
agreed that symptoms of crying, irritability and colic, as single manifestation, 
are not suggestive of CMA. They agreed that amino-acid based formula (AAF) 
should be reserved for severe cases (e.g., malnutrition and anaphylaxis) and 
that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a step-down approach. There was 
no unanimous consensus on the statement that a cow's milk based extensively 
hydrolysed formula (eHF) should be the first choice as a diagnostic elimination 
diet in mild/moderate cases. Although the statements regarding the role for 
hydrolysed rice formula as a diagnostic and therapeutic elimination diet were 
accepted, 3/27 disagreed. The votes regarding soy formula highlight the 
differences in opinion in the role of soy protein in CMA dietary treatment. 
Generally, soy-based formula is seldom available in the Middle-East region. All 
ESPGHAN experts agreed that there is insufficient evidence that the addition of 
probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics increase the efficacy of elimination diets 
regarding CMA symptoms (despite other benefits such as decrease of infections 
and antibiotic intake), whereas 3/14 of the Middle East group thought there was 
sufficient evidence.
DISCUSSION: Differences in voting are related to geographical, cultural and 
other conditions, such as cost and availability. This emphasizes the need to 
develop region-specific guidelines considering social and cultural conditions, 
and to perform further research in this area.

Gluten has been a topic of significant interest and research recently. It has 
become a media darling over the past few years for a variety of medical and 
non-medical reasons, and interest has led to a vast body of literature and 
information that is occasionally confusing and misleading. This review 
categorizes the diseases associated with gluten based on confirmed medical 
facts. Gluten (from Latin gluten, meaning glue) is a composite of storage 
proteins termed prolamins and glutelins that are stored together with starch in 
various cereal (grass) grains. It is found in wheat, barley, rye, oat, related 
species, hybrids (such as spelled Khorasan and emmer, among others), and their 
products, such as malt. Gluten gives elasticity to dough, allowing for the puffy 
and chewy texture. About 80% of the protein in bread wheat is gluten. Pasta has 
a lesser degree of gluten. Imitation meats, beer, soy sauce, and occasionally, 
ice cream and ketchup have gluten from the included stabilizing agents. 
Contamination of other food products with gluten is also a common problem. Hair 
products and cosmetics sometimes contain gluten, as well. Gluten is significant 
for physicians since it has a spectrum of illnesses associated with it, for 
example, gluten-sensitive enteropathy or celiac disease (CD), non-celiac gluten 
sensitivity (NCGS), wheat or grain allergy, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis 
herpetiformis (DH). History Aretaeus Cappadocia described a non-specific entity 
termed koiliakos in 250 AD. Koelia is Greek for the abdomen. Francis Adams 
translated this to English in 1856, using the term Coeliacs or celiacs. Samuel 
Gee famously said in 1888 that "to regulate the food is the main part of the 
treatment"  and that "if the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of 
diet." Carnegie Brown published a book in 1908 that described peripheral 
neuritis in patients with CD. The book also discussed "sprue" and ataxia, but 
this was hard to prove since the actual diagnosis could not be confirmed with 
certainty. Second World War II led to devastation and famine across the world. 
Most people suffered from malnutrition and illnesses, but the subgroup with 
celiac improved and felt better. Dutch Pediatrician Willem-Karel Dicke noted 
that mortality from the disease decreased from 30% pre-war to a lesser figure, 
which was reversed after the war. His papers were some of the first that 
mentioned the effect of a wheat-free diet on children. Eventually, small bowel 
biopsy methods were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and diagnosis could be 
confirmed. In 1961, Taylor published an immunological study and linked the 
disease to circulating antibodies. Although it was initially thought to be a 
food allergy, the autoimmune theory was accepted, and HLA-DQ2 was linked to it. 
In 1966, enteropathy was noted in 9 of 12 patients with dermatitis 
herpetiformis. In the same year, it was noted that CD was associated with many 
neurological disorders. In the 1980s, the journal Gastroenterology coined 
“non-celiac gluten sensitivity.” This disease was very prevalent in Europe but 
not so much in the United States. Alessio Fasano, who treated celiac patients in 
Europe, moved to Boston to work at Massachusetts General Hospital and found that 
it was a prevalent disease in the United States as well. His 2003 article in 
the Journal of American Medical Association started a process of recognizing the 
disease and paved the way for many more studies on the subject. Studies in the 
2000s and 2010s linked the disease to almost everything. Gluten was quickly 
vilified. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started requiring the labeling 
of gluten-free products in 2013. Gluten-free mania ballooned the related global 
industry to a $3.5 billion per year figure with a forecast of $4.7 billion in 
2020. Gluten-free pizza, cookbooks, apps, and restaurants have mushroomed 
rapidly since.

Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common chromosomal anomalies. 
Gastrointestinal disorders in DS are predominantly related to anatomical 
anomalies and celiac disease. In 2015, the first two cases of non-IgE-mediated 
food allergy in patients with DS were described. However, gastrointestinal 
symptoms experienced by subjects with DS have never been related to a possible 
non-IgE-mediated food allergy and a Food Protein-induced Enterocolitis syndrome 
(FPIES). A retrospective descriptive single-center study was conducted. Subjects 
included were children with acute FPIES who entered our institutional follow-up 
protocol between January 2013 and January 2020. Among the 85 patients 
(forty-nine boys-57.6%), ten (11.76%) were children with DS. In our population, 
the FPIES triggers included different foods (such as milk, egg, fruit, fish, 
wheat, soy, beef, etc.). Nine patients with DS showed FPIES reactions after 
ingesting cow's milk (one even with beef and three with soy), while the last one 
was affected by FPIES to fish. Considering the subgroup of patients affected by 
cow's milk FPIES (40 subjects overall), 22.5% had a diagnosis of DS. Patients 
with DS experienced acute FPIES reactions with a severity degree slightly higher 
than that reported in other patients, ranging from mild-moderate to severe or 
very severe. During the acute reactions, the patients with DS showed increased 
white blood cell production, absolute neutrophil count and C-reactive protein 
levels. This series provides a starting point for novel hypothesis-testing 
clinical research and possible specific immunological alterations in FPIES 
children with or without DS.

Ongoing research in the food industry is striving to replace wheat flour with 
new alternatives from sustainable sources to overcome the disease burden in the 
existing population. Celiac disease, wheat allergy, gluten sensitivity, or 
non-celiac gluten sensitivity are some common disorders associated with gluten 
present in wheat. These scientific findings are crucial to finding appropriate 
alternatives in introducing new ingredients supporting the consumer's 
requirements. Among the alternatives, amaranth, barley, coconut, chestnut, 
maize, millet, teff, oat, rye, sorghum, soy, rice flour, and legumes could be 
considered appropriate due to their chemical composition, bioactive profile, and 
alternatives utilization in the baking industry. Furthermore, the enrichment of 
these alternatives with proper ingredients is considered effective. Literature 
demonstrated that the flours from these alternative sources significantly 
enhanced the physicochemical, pasting, and rheological properties of the doughs. 
These flours boost a significant reduction in gluten proteins associated with 
food intolerance, in comparison with wheat highlighting a visible market 
opportunity with nutritional and organoleptic benefits for food producers. 
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: New alternatives from sustainable sources to wheat in 
bakery foods as an approach that affects human health. Alternatives from 
sustainable sources are important source of nutrients and bioactive compounds. 
Alternatives from sustainable sources are rising due to nutritional and consumer 
demand in bakery industry. New alternatives from sustainable sources improve 
physicochemical, pasting, and rheological properties of dough. Non-wheat-based 
foods from non-traditional grains have a potential to increase consumer market 
acceptance.

Recent increase in gluten allergy has led to high demand for gluten free 
products such as rice pasta. Although rice grains are rich in bioactive 
compounds and B vitamins, they are generally low in protein compared to wheat 
grains. The aim of this study was to determine the quality attributes of soy 
enriched rice pasta. Five Rice-soy pastas were produced from different blends 
(10-30%) of soybean flour and rice flour. The proximate composition, cooking 
quality, colour, texture profile, and sensory attributes of the pastas were 
determined. Results showed increased in protein (6.7-12.1%), crude fibre 
(0.8-1.3%), ash (0.6-2.2%) and energy values (379-389 kcal/100g). Fortification 
improved the colour, reduce cooking time (15.59-15.11 min) but increased cooking 
loss (7.30-7.49%). The hardness (506-314 g), springiness (1.25-0.71 mm) and 
chewiness (417-334 g x mm) values decreased while gumminess (417-334 g) 
increased. Rice pasta enriched with 15% soybean flour was highly ranked for 
sensory attributes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Rice-soy pasta 
can serve as nutritious alternative to conventional rice pasta, and also add 
variety to food groups for people suffering from celiac disease.

OBJECTIVE: The coexistence of celiac disease (CeD) and eosinophilic esophagitis 
(EoE) in pediatric patients has been increasingly recognized. In the current 
study, we have aimed to assess the outcomes of therapeutic dietary interventions 
in a cohort of pediatric patients with CeD and EoE.
METHODS: Pediatric patient records obtained from the University of Chicago 
Celiac Center Database from August 2008 to July 2013 were reviewed. Information 
was collected on patients with concomitant CeD and EoE regarding age, sex, dates 
of diagnoses, presenting symptoms, length of symptoms before diagnosis, familial 
and personal atopic history, dietary therapy, and esophageal histologic response 
to dietary therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 350 records of patients with CeD were reviewed. Twenty-two 
(6.3%) had a confirmed diagnosis of CeD and EoE, 17 had repeat biopsies. Four of 
17 (23.5%) had resolution of esophageal eosinophilia on an exclusive gluten-free 
diet, 10 of 17 (59%) required additional eliminations to show histologic 
resolution, 1 of 17 (6%) had not reached histological remission, and 2 of 17 
(12%) were lost to follow-up. Success rates of single food reintroductions were: 
soy 5 of 5 (100%), eggs 3 of 5 (60%), dairy 3 of 7 (43%), nuts 2 of 4 (50%), and 
fish 2 of 4 (50%).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest pediatric study to assess the 
histologic outcome of EoE-associated esophageal eosinophilia in response to 
dietary management of pediatric patients with concomitant CeD and EoE. We 
demonstrate that soy is well tolerated in this cohort, and suggest that 
reintroducing this food first, or trialing a soy-inclusive elimination diet is a 
viable strategy.

Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food hypersensitivity includes a spectrum of 
disorders that predominantly affect the gastrointestinal tract. This review will 
focus on the following more common non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity 
syndromes: food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), allergic 
proctocolitis (AP), food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE) and celiac disease. 
FPIES, AP and FPE typically present in infancy and are most commonly triggered 
by cow's milk protein or soy. The usual presenting features are profuse emesis 
and dehydration in FPIES; blood-streaked and mucousy stools in AP; and 
protracted diarrhea with malabsorption in FPE. Since there are no confirmatory 
noninvasive diagnostic tests for most of these disorders, the diagnosis is based 
on a convincing history and resolution of symptoms with food avoidance. The 
mainstay of management for FPIES, AP and FPE is avoidance of the suspected 
inciting food, with periodic oral food challenges to assess for resolution, 
which generally occurs in the first few years of life. Celiac disease is an 
immune-mediated injury caused by the ingestion of gluten that leads to villous 
atrophy in the small intestine in genetically susceptible individuals. Serologic 
tests and small intestinal biopsy are required to confirm the diagnosis of 
celiac disease, and management requires life-long adherence to a strict 
gluten-free diet.

Kendra is a 4-year-old girl with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who presents for 
follow-up of feeding problems to her pediatric clinician. She is an only child 
in a family where both parents are scientists. Feeding concerns date to infancy, 
when she was diagnosed with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) associated 
with persistent bottle refusal and the acceptance of few pureed foods. At 13 
months, milk and peanut allergies were diagnosed. Following a feeding clinic 
evaluation at 24 months, she was prescribed a soy milk supplement and an H2 
blocker. There was no concern for oral-motor dysfunction. She was also referred 
to early intervention for feeding therapy. However, her parents terminated 
participation after 6 months because she became anxious and had tantrum prior to 
treatment groups.She was seen in another feeding program at 3 years; zinc, 
folate, thyroid, and a celiac panel were normal, and an endoscopy was negative 
for eosinophilic esophagitis. She began individual feeding therapy, where 
concerns for rigidity, difficulty transitioning, and limited peer interactions 
led to a neuropsychological evaluation. Kendra was diagnosed with an ASD and 
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Her cognitive skills were 
average, and expressive and receptive language skills were low average.Her diet 
consisted of French fries, Ritz crackers, pretzels, and 32 ounces of soy formula 
daily. She had stopped accepting Cheerios and saltines 2 months prior. She 
controlled other aspects of feeding, insisting on a specific parking spot at a 
fast food restaurant and drinking from a particular sippy cup. Her parents 
accepted these demands with concern about her caloric intake, which they tracked 
daily.Following diagnosis with ARFID, she resumed feeding therapy using a 
systematic desensitization approach with rewards. At the first session, she 
kissed and licked 2 new foods without gagging. Her mother appeared receptive to 
recommendations that included continuing the "food game" at home, replacing 1 
ounce of soy formula by offering water each day, limiting between-meal grazing, 
and refusing specific feeding demands.Currently, her parents plan to discontinue 
feeding therapy with concerns that the treatment was "too harsh." Her father 
produces logs of her caloric and micronutrient intake as evidence that she did 
not replace missed formula with other foods and reports that she subsequently 
became more difficult to manage behaviorally. Her father now demands to see 
randomized controlled trials of feeding therapy approaches. Her weight is 
stable, but she has now limited her pretzel intake to a specific brand. How 
would you approach her continued care?

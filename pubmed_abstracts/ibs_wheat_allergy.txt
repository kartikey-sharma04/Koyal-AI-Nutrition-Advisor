PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of gluten and wheat in irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) is unclear, whereas it plays a key-role in the diagnosis and treatment of 
noncoeliac gluten or wheat sensitivity (NCGWS). This review aims to provide the 
most recent insights in pathophysiological mechanisms and to summarize the 
evidence for a gluten- or wheat-free diet in IBS and NCGWS.
RECENT FINDINGS: The exact role of gluten and wheat in IBS and NCGWS 
pathophysiological mechanisms remains complex. However, recent findings suggest 
a role for antigliadin antibodies to identify those IBS patients who may benefit 
from a gluten-free diet and low levels of fecal calprotectin to differentiate 
IBS and NCGWS. The importance of gut-brain interactions in self-reported gluten 
sensitive individuals was shown by a strong nocebo effect, although a role of 
gluten could not be excluded. Evidence for a gluten-free diet remains debatable 
in both conditions, whereas a wheat-free diet may have more potential, 
especially in NCGWS.
SUMMARY: IBS and NCGWS are two closely related conditions with a complex and 
largely unrevealed pathophysiology. The role of gluten may have been 
overestimated in the past, but it is likely that certain wheat components, along 
with gut-brain interactions, play a role in both conditions.

The gut barrier encompasses several interactive, physical, and functional 
components, such as the gut microbiota, the mucus layer, the epithelial layer 
and the gut mucosal immunity. All these contribute to homeostasis in a 
well-regulated manner. Nevertheless, this frail balance might be disrupted for 
instance by westernized dietary habits, infections, pollution or exposure to 
antibiotics, thus diminishing protective immunity and leading to the onset of 
chronic diseases. Several gaps of knowledge still exist as regards this 
multi-level interaction. In this review we aim to summarize current evidence 
linking food antigens, microbiota and gut permeability interference in diverse 
disease conditions such as celiac disease (CeD), non-celiac wheat sensitivity 
(NCWS), food allergies (FA), eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (EOGID) and 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Specific food elimination diets are recommended 
for CeD, NCWS, FA and in some cases for EOGID. Undoubtfully, each of these 
conditions is very different and quite unique, albeit food antigens/compounds, 
intestinal permeability and specific microbiota signatures orchestrate immune 
response and decide clinical outcomes for all of them.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Gastrointestinal adverse reaction to food (GARF) is 
reported frequently in the general population and even more in patients with 
disorders of the gut brain axis. However, there is a significant difference 
between self-reported and objective proven GARF. The aim of the study was to 
characterize a mucosal correlate of GARF by endoscopic confocal laser 
endomicroscopy (eCLE) with duodenal food challenge (DFC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an observational and proof of concept study we 
evaluated 71 patients with disorders of the gut brain axis without (group I, 
n=19) and with (group II, n=52) GARF by eCLE and DFC. Spontaneous and food 
induced transfer of fluorescein into duodenal lumen was detected 10 minutes 
following intravenously application of fluorescein and 10 minutes after DFC.
RESULTS: According to Rom IV, the patients (group I/II) could be classified as 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 32%/31%, functional abdominal pain without 
changes in bowel movement 47 %/48 %, functional abdominal bloating/distension 0 
%/10 %, functional diarrhea 5 %/ 2 %, and unspecified functional bowel disorder 
16 %/10 %, respectively. 21 %/27 % of the patients responded with a fluorescein 
leakage into the duodenal lumen before and 74 %/69 % following to DFC. Frequency 
rank order of food components that induced a response were soy (55.5 %/60 %), 
wheat (60 %/45.5 %), egg (35.7 %/8.3), milk (30 %/18.2 %) and yeast (10 %/6.6 
%), respectively. Histology of duodenal biopsies, number, form and distribution 
of intraepithelial lymphocytes and mucosal mast cells as well as mast cell 
function were normal. Overall, 14 %/79 % reported main symptom benefit following 
a food exclusion therapy according to eCLE and DFC that was significant 
different between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that eCLE with DFC is a technique 
to clinically evaluate patients with disorders of the gut brain axis and GARF 
resulting in a high proportion of patients reporting symptom benefit upon food 
exclusion dietary advice focussed on the results of eCLE.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND UND STUDIENZIEL: Gastrointestinale 
Nahrungsunverträglichkeiten (GARF) werden häufig in der Allgemeinbevölkerung und 
insbesondere bei Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse berichtet. 
Allerdings besteht eine große Diskrepanz zwischen der subjektiv empfundenen und 
der objektivierten GARF. Das Studienziel war die Charakterisierung eines 
mukosalen Korrelates durch die duodenale Nahrungsprovokation (DFC) mittels 
endoskopischer konfokaler Laserendomikroskopie (eCLE).
PATIENTEN UND METHODE: In einer Observations- und „proof of concept“-Studie 
wurden 71 Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse ohne (Gruppe I, n=19) und 
mit (Gruppe II, n=52) GARF durch eCLE und DFC untersucht. Hierbei wurden der 
spontane und nahrungsinduzierte Transfer von Fluorescein in das Duodenallumen 10 
Minuten nach intravenöser Gabe untersucht.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Patienten (Gruppe I/II) wurden gemäß Rom IV-Kriterien in 
Reizdarmsyndrom (IBS) 32%/31%, funktionelle Bauchschmerzen ohne 
Stuhlgangverändeurngen 47%/48%, funktionelle Blähungen/Bauchdistension 0%/10%, 
funktionelle Diarrhoe 5%/ 2%, and unspezifische funktionelle Bauchbeschwerden 
16%/10% klassifiziert. 21%/27% der Patienten zeigten einen Transfer von 
Fluorescein in das Duodenallumen vor und 74%/69% nach DFC. Die 
Häufigkeitsrangfolge der Nahrungskomponenten, die eine Reaktion auslösten, waren 
Soja (55,5%/60%), Weizen (60%/45,5%), Ei (35,7%/8,3%), Milch (30%/18,2%) und 
Hefe (10%/6,6%). Sowohl die Histologie der Duodenalbiopsien, die Zahl, Form und 
Verteilung der intraepithelialen Lymphozyten und Mastzellen als auch die 
Funktion der Mastzellen waren unauffällig. Insgesamt berichteten 14%/79% über 
eine Symptomenbesserung durch eine diätetische Ausschlusstherapie gemäß den 
Ergebnissen der DFC, die zwischen den beiden Gruppen nicht signifikant 
unterschiedlich war.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigen, dass eCLE mit DFC eine 
Technik zur Untersuchung von Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse und 
GARF ist. Hierdurch kann eine große Gruppe von Patienten charakterisiert werden, 
die von einer diätetischen Auschlusstherapie gemäß den Ergebnissen der eCLE 
profitieren.

Some data suggest the existence of intestinal inflammation in patients with 
non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). We aimed to verify whether fecal 
calprotectin (FCP), a marker of intestinal inflammation, could be used to 
confirm this inflammatory status and to test its diagnostic performance in 
differentiating NCWS from irritable bowel syndrome/functional dyspepsia 
(IBS/FD). We conducted a multicenter study, comparing NCWS patients, diagnosed 
by a double-blind placebo-controlled wheat challenge, with IBS/FD subjects. In 
the retrospective phase, FCP values were analyzed to define the prevalence of 
its positivity and its role as a NCWS diagnostic biomarker. In the prospective 
phase we tested the effects of a strict 6-month wheat-free diet (WFD) on FCP 
values. 31.3% (n = 63/201) of NCWS patients had above normal FCP values (NCWS 
FCP +), whereas all IBS/FD patients proved negative (P = 0.0001). FCP using a 
cut-off value > 41 µg/g showed a 58.6% sensitivity and a 98.0% specificity (AUC 
0.755, 95% C.I. 0.702-0.837) in distinguishing NCWS from IBS/FD patients. Of the 
63 NCWS FCP+, 65.1% had negative FCP values after ≥ 6 months of WFD, with a 
significant reduction in FCP values (P < 0.0001). All NCWS FCP- subjects still 
preserved negative FCP values after ≥ 6 months of WFD. Our study showed that FCP 
can be a useful but supplementary diagnostic marker for differentiating between 
NCWS and IBS/FD. Strict WFD adherence reduced FCP values, normalizing them in 
65.1% of NCWS FCP + subjects. These data suggest the existence of two NCWS 
subgroups: NCWS FCP + characterized by a probable predominantly 
inflammatory/immunologic pattern and NCWS FCP- featuring non-immuno-mediated 
etiopathogenetic mechanisms. (Registration number NCT01762579).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Individuals with celiac disease (CD), non-celiac wheat 
sensitivity (NCWS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), show overlapping 
clinical symptoms and experience gut dysbiosis. A limited number of studies so 
far compared the gut microbiota among these intestinal conditions. This study 
aimed to investigate the similarities in the gut microbiota among patients with 
CD, NCWS, and IBS in comparison to healthy controls (HC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, in total 72 adult subjects, 
including CD (n = 15), NCWS (n = 12), IBS (n = 30), and HC (n = 15) were 
recruited. Fecal samples were collected from each individual. A quantitative 
real-time PCR (qPCR) test using 16S ribosomal RNA was conducted on stool samples 
to assess the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacterium 
spp., and Lactobacillus spp.
RESULTS: In all groups, Firmicutes and Lactobacillus spp. had the highest and 
lowest relative abundance respectively. The phylum Firmicutes had a higher 
relative abundance in CD patients than other groups. On the other hand, the 
phylum Bacteroidetes had the highest relative abundance among healthy subjects 
but the lowest in patients with NCWS. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium 
spp. was lower in subjects with CD (P = 0.035) and IBS (P = 0.001) compared to 
the HCs. Also, the alteration of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) 
was statistically significant in NCWS and CD patients compared to the HCs 
(P = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), as a powerful multivariate 
analysis, suggested that the investigated gut microbial profile of patients with 
IBS and NCWS share more similarities to the HCs. In contrast, patients with CD 
had the most dissimilarity compared to the other groups in the context of the 
studied gut microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Patients suffering from non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) 
frequently report extra-intestinal symptoms, such as anemia.
AIMS: We investigated the prevalence and associated clinical features of anemia 
in NCWS patients.
METHODS: Data from 244 NCWS patients, diagnosed by double-blind 
placebo-controlled wheat challenge, were retrospectively reviewed and compared 
with 2 control groups (celiac disease (CD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)). 
Furthermore, 31 NCWS anemic patients were prospectively re-evaluated after at 
least 12 months on the "strict" wheat-free diet (WFD).
RESULTS: Anemia prevalence in NCWS patients was 34.8% (mean hemoglobin 
10.4 ± 1.4 g/dl), significantly higher than in IBS (17.4%, P = 0.03), but not in 
CD ones. The NCWS group, on the whole, had sideropenic-like features with low 
serum iron and altered iron deposits. Both anemia prevalence and 
sideropenic-like features were more evident in CD than in NCWS patients, whereas 
only a few IBS subjects showed such features. Significant differences were found 
in anemic vs non-anemic NCWS patients as regards to female sex, diagnostic 
delay, poly/hypermenorrhea, iron deficiency, and higher TSH values. A long-term 
WFD significantly reduced anemia and improved iron metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Microcytic/hypochromic anemia and altered iron metabolism occur 
frequently in NCWS and can be treated with a long-term strict WFD. NCWS should 
be included in differential diagnosis of anemic patients with "functional 
gastrointestinal troubles".

Frequently, patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) report 
intolerance of wheat products. We compared gastrointestinal symptoms, sensory 
function, psychiatric comorbidities, gut-homing immune cells, and duodenal 
mucosa-associated microbiome (d-MAM) in FGID patients and controls with and 
without self-reported wheat sensitivity (SR-NCWS). We recruited 40 FGID patients 
and 20 controls referred by GPs for treatment. Gastrointestinal/extraintestinal 
symptoms, visceral sensory function, psychological comorbidities, and SR-NCWS 
were assessed in a standardized approach. Peripheral gut homing T-cells 
(CD4+α4+β7+CCR9+/CD8+α4+β7+CCR9+) were quantified, and the d-MAM was assessed by 
DNA sequencing for 46 subjects. Factors of bacterial genera were extracted 
utilizing factor analysis with varimax rotation and factors univariately 
associated with FGID or SR-NCWS included in a subsequent multivariate analysis 
of variance to identify statistically independent discriminators. Anxiety scores 
(p < .05) and increased symptom responses to a nutrient challenge (p < .05) were 
univariately associated with FGID. Gut homing T-cells were increased in FGID 
patients with SR-NCWS compared to other groups (p all <0.05). MANOVA revealed 
that anxiety (p = .03), visceral sensory function (p = 0.007), and a d-MAM 
factor comprise members of the Alloprevotella, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, 
Leptotrichia, and Veillonella lineages were significantly (p = .001) associated 
with FGID, while gut homing CD4+α4+ β7+CCR9+ T-cells were associated (p = .002) 
with SR-NCWS. Compared to controls, patients with and without SR-NCWS show that 
there are shifts in the amplicon sequence variants within specific bacterial 
genera between the FGID subgroups (particularly Prevotella and Streptococcus) as 
well as distinct bacterial taxa discriminatory for the two different FGID 
subtypes. Compared to controls, both FGID patients with and without SR-NCWS have 
an increased symptom response to a standardized nutrient challenge and increased 
anxiety scores. The FGID patients with SR-NCWS - as compared to FGID without 
SR-NCWS (and controls without SR-NCWS) - have increased gut homing T-cells. The 
d-MAM profiles suggest species and strain-based variations between the two FGID 
subtypes and in comparison to controls.

Many patients report symptoms after wheat ingestion experiencing a wide spectrum 
of clinical manifestations. Three possible diagnoses have been recognized: 
celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA), and non-celiac (gluten) wheat 
sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS). CD is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the small 
bowel caused by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed 
individuals, with a prevalence of approximately 1%. It is characterized by 
mucosal inflammation and atrophy following exposure to gluten and improvement 
after gluten withdrawal. Food allergies are immunological responses to a food 
antigen. WA is the expression of an immunologically mediated process that can be 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) or non-IgE mediated; its many symptoms include 
urticaria/angioedema, asthma, rhinitis, and anaphylaxis. NCGS/NCWS is 
characterized by gastrointestinal and/or extra-intestinal symptoms after 
ingestion of gluten-containing food in subjects not affected by CD or WA. The 
aim of this review is to help physicians and nutritionists diagnose the cause of 
symptoms reported after wheat ingestion, thus avoiding patient frustration, 
inappropriate testing, and incorrect or missed diagnoses. An algorithm for the 
diagnostic approach in these patients is provided, to help to diagnose CD, WA, 
NCGS/NCWS or to identify possible functional disorders as the wheat-sensitive 
irritable bowel syndrome. A personalized approach, regular follow-up, and the 
help of a skilled healthcare professional are mandatory for patients with 
symptoms following wheat ingestion is provided. A gluten-free-diet is often 
recommended for patients with self-reported gluten/wheat-dependent symptoms; for 
patients with symptoms similar to those of functional diseases while there is 
evidence that a low-FODMAP diet could be the first option.

Lactose malabsorption (LM), celiac disease (CD), non-celiac gluten sensitivity 
(NCGS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are conditions associated with food 
triggers, improvement after withdrawal, treatment with dietary restriction, and 
subsequent nutritional detriments. LM occurs when there is incomplete hydrolysis 
of lactose due to lactase deficiency and frequently produces abdominal symptoms; 
therefore, it can cause lactose intolerance (LI). A lactose-restricted diet is 
frequently recommended, although it can potentially lead to nutrient 
deficiencies. Furthermore, lactose is an essential component of fermentable 
oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) and is subsequently 
associated with intolerance to these compounds, especially in IBS. LM commonly 
presents in CD. Nutritional deficits are common in CD and can continue even on a 
gluten-free diet (GFD). Conditions triggered by gluten are known as 
gluten-related disorders (GRDs), including CD, wheat allergy, and NCGS. IBS can 
also be associated with a gluten sensitivity. A GFD is the treatment for CD, 
GRDs, and gluten sensitive IBS, although compliance with this restricted diet 
can be difficult. Strict dietary therapies can have a negative effect on quality 
of life. This review aims to provide an overview of the difficult nutritional 
elements of these disorders, which are critical for medical providers to 
recognize when managing these patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating are frequent in 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like disorders, although little is known about 
their intestinal ultrastructural alterations. The aim of the present study was 
to study duodenal biopsies from IBS-like patients to find ultrastructural 
alterations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design: descriptive comparative pilot study. Thirty 
outpatients (9 male and 21 female; median age 37.7 years; range, 20 to 65 years) 
complaining of IBS-like symptoms were enrolled between January 2015 to May 2019 
and were divided into 6 groups, each equally consisting of 5 patients: (A) 
untreated celiac disease (uCD); (B) treated celiac disease (tCD); (C) wheat 
allergy (WA); (D) Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS); (E) Nickel allergic 
contact mucositis (Ni ACM); (F) controls affected by GERD. Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) morphological characteristics were: microvilli length, 
intermicrovillar distance, junctional complexes (JC) gap width, autophagic 
bodies, apoptosis, altered mitochondria, lipid/chylomicron droplets, and mast 
cells. Regarding JC, we focused on tight junctions (TJ), adherens junctions 
(AJ), and desmosomes.
RESULTS: Major alterations in microvilli length and intermicrovillar distance 
have been observed in the subjects affected by uCD. Microvilli of tCD patients 
showed marked recovery after adequate GFD, although not comparable to controls. 
Intermediate microvillar alterations were instead observed in NCGS and Ni ACM, 
while characteristics of WA subjects appeared more similar to tCD. Regarding JC, 
TJ did not show significant differences between all groups studied, including 
controls. The AJ were significantly more dilated in all groups compared to 
controls, while no significant differences were found between the pathological 
groups. The distance between desmosomes was greater in uCD, NCGS, and Ni ACM 
than in tCD, WA, and controls. Finally, intracellular alterations have been 
detected in most of the groups studied although they seemed more unspecific.
CONCLUSIONS: TEM analysis confirmed damages to the intestinal barrier and 
defense mechanisms by enterocytes in IBS-like patients, probably linked to 
low-grade inflammation or adverse reactions triggered by food allergens, heavy 
metals, or other unknown. On the other hand, our study needs confirmation and 
further investigations with larger populations to facilitate diagnosis, therapy, 
and prevention of IBS-like disorders in the future.

BACKGROUND: IgE binding to linear peptides from the N-terminal region of Ara h 2 
(epitope 1) is associated with the achievement of sustained unresponsiveness 
(SU) in young children receiving oral immunotherapy (OIT) and may be important 
for cross-reactivity between peanuts and tree nuts. This region is also part of 
the binding site for neutralizing IgG monoclonal antibodies associated with SU 
following OIT.
OBJECTIVE: To perform alanine scanning of this epitope to determine the 
importance of individual amino acids and then amino acid scanning to screen for 
sequences with enhanced binding of IgE.
METHODS: A streptavidin IgE ELISA with biotinylated peptides was used to measure 
the binding of IgE to full length and truncated peptides in order to identify a 
core sequence (DRRCQSQLERAN). Peptide microarrays were used to screen multiple 
peptides and quantitate binding of IgE. Statistical analysis included one way 
ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test.
RESULTS: IgE binding was greatly reduced when alanine was substituted for 
arginine at positions 2, 3 and 10 (R2, P<0.001, R3, P<0.01, R10, P<0.001), 
glutamine at position 5 and 7 (Q5, P<0.01, Q7, P<0.001) and glutamate at 
position 9 (E9, P<0.01). Substitution of aspartate with asparagine at position 1 
in conjunction with substitution of asparagine at position 12 with either 
leucine or lysine gave enhanced binding (p<0.0001). Molecular modeling of these 
data suggests a conformational basis for recognition by polyclonal IgE.
CONCLUSIONS: IgE binding assays using pooled and individual sera demonstrated 
the importance of aa throughout the sequence of epitope 1 for immune 
recognition. The results of alanine scanning indicated residues that could be 
changed as part of a larger strategy to generate hypoallergenic forms of Ara h 2 
while sequence variants with enhanced binding were identified that may be useful 
for improving diagnostics.

BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) 
addendum guidelines for primary prevention of peanut allergy1 provide 
recommendations regarding peanut introduction, and a recent consensus statement 
highlighted the importance of timely introduction of other commonly allergenic 
solids, and the role of family history as a risk factor.2ObjectiveTo determine 
whether children in households with a food allergic parent/caregiver or sibling 
have different rates of being fed commonly allergenic solids during the first 
year of life than children lacking this family history.
METHODS: A pretested survey was administered between January-February 2021 to a 
U.S. sample of 3,062 parents/caregivers of children born since the NIAID 
Addendum guidelines. Survey-weighted chi-square statistics and logistic 
regression models tested the independence of key variables across strata of 
interest before and after covariate adjustment.
RESULTS: Peanut, almond, shellfish, and other tree nuts are more likely to be 
introduced to children with one or more food-allergic caregivers. Respondents 
with food-allergic parents (39.3%) and siblings with FA (35.8%) were more 
familiar with the 2017 NIAID guidelines compared to parents (12.9%) and siblings 
without FA (12.7%).
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that respondents with food-allergic parents and 
siblings are more likely to have many of the most prevalent allergens introduced 
at younger ages, which could be due to knowledge related to the NIAID-sponsored 
guidelines and other national guidance, but that even among these higher-risk 
families overall rates of "early" introduction during infancy still remain 
relatively low.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As an ex-vivo test of allergic effector cell activation, 
basophil activation testing (BAT) to allergen enables quantification of the 
in-vivo IgE-mediated allergic response. BAT thus holds promise in the diagnosis 
and monitoring of peanut and tree nut allergies. Recent systematic analyses and 
expert recommendations support a role for BAT in the diagnosis of peanut and 
tree nut allergy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic cut-offs for BAT in peanut and tree nut allergy have 
been identified. Consistently, BAT can discriminate with high sensitivity and 
specificity between allergy and tolerance when measured against oral food 
challenges. Furthermore, the utilization of BAT has can increase the sensitivity 
and specificity of peanut allergy and tree nut allergy diagnosis, both alone and 
in conjunction with specific IgE testing and skin prick testing. BAT is a 
promising tool in the diagnosis of peanut and tree nut allergy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is an increasing awareness among clinicians that 
industrial and household food processing methods can increase or decrease the 
allergenicity of foods. Modification to allergen properties through processing 
can enable dietary liberations. Reduced allergenicity may also allow for lower 
risk immunotherapy approaches. This review will equip physicians, nurses, 
dieticians and other health care providers with an updated overview of the most 
clinically oriented research in this field. We summarize studies assessing the 
allergenicity of processed foods through clinically accessible means, such as 
oral food challenges, skin prick tests, and sIgE levels.
RECENT FINDINGS: Baking, boiling, canning, fermenting, pasteurizing, peeling, 
powdering, and roasting heterogenously impact the likelihood of reactivity in 
egg-, milk-, peanut- and other legume-, tree nut-, fruit-, and seafood-allergic 
patients. These variations may be due to the use of different temperatures, 
duration of processing, presence of a matrix, and the specific allergens 
involved, among other factors. Accurate prediction of tolerance to processed 
allergens with skin prick tests and sIgE levels remains largely elusive. Food 
allergy management strategies, especially with milk and egg, have capitalized on 
the decreased allergenicity of baking. Many milk- and egg-allergic patients 
tolerate baked and heated forms of these allergens, and the use of these 
processed foods in oral immunotherapy (OIT) continues to be extensively 
investigated. Heat is also well recognized to reduce allergic symptoms from some 
fruits and vegetables in food-pollen syndrome. Other forms of processing such as 
boiling, fermenting, and canning can reduce allergenicity to a diverse array of 
foods. Roasting, on the other hand, may increase allergenicity. The application 
of food processing to food allergy treatments remains largely unexplored by 
large clinical studies and provides a key avenue for future research. The 
recognition that food allergy represents a spectrum of hypersensitivity, rather 
than an all-or-nothing phenomenon, has led to approaches to enable dietary 
liberation with processed, less-allergenic foods and their use in food allergy 
immunotherapies.

BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of food allergy (FA) has increased markedly 
across recent decades, with millions of patients engaging in airline travel each 
year. However, air travel can pose specific challenges to FA management.
OBJECTIVE: To collect global data about patients' and families' FA-related 
airline travel experiences, attitudes, and behaviors.
METHODS: An electronic survey was developed and refined by global FA 
stakeholders, which was administered between October 2022 and January 2023 to 
patients with FA and caregivers recruited via 45 FA patient advocacy 
organizations and research institutions.
RESULTS: Most of the 4704 survey respondents self-reported as female (88.4%), 
aged between 40 and 59 years (67.7%), and non-Hispanic White race (75.8%), and 
resided in the United States (79.6%). A history of 1 or more in-flight 
food-allergic reaction was reported by 8.5% of participants, with peanut (3.9%), 
tree nuts (2.4%), and milk (0.6%) the most reported triggers. Epinephrine was 
administered in 15.1% of reactions and was most often self-carried (91.7% of 
events). Only 57.4% of in-flight reactions were reported to either the flight 
crew in the air or the airline on landing. Many preventive measures were 
reportedly taken by respondents to avoid adverse FA outcomes during air travel, 
including specific requests for accommodation, which were often not provided as 
assured. Respondents generally reported high levels of anxiety managing FA 
during air travel and that FA-related policies and other related factors were 
primary drivers of travel-related decision making.
CONCLUSIONS: Air travel presents numerous challenges to optimal FA management, 
many of which can be at least partially mitigated though consistent 
implementation of appropriate FA-related policies.

This Anaphylaxis Manifesto calls on communities to prioritise 10 practical 
actions to improve the lives of people at risk of serious allergic reactions. 
The Global Allergy and Asthma European Network and the European Federation of 
Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients' Associations (EFA) compiled 
patient-centric priorities. We used qualitative consensus methods, research 
evidence and feedback from over 200 patient groups, stakeholder organisations 
and healthcare professionals. We encourage healthcare, education and food 
organisations to collaborate with people at risk of serious allergic reactions 
to tackle safety, anxiety and financial burdens for individuals and societies. 
Key priorities for prevention include awareness-raising campaigns for the public 
and professionals, school and workplace initiatives and mandatory precautionary 
allergen labels on food. Priorities for improving immediate and long-term 
management include educating healthcare professionals, patients and schools 
about when and how to use adrenaline, funding two approved adrenaline devices 
for everyone at risk, and facilitating access to allergy specialists. Integrated 
care pathways should include clinical and non-clinical management options such 
as individualised risk assessment and quality of life assessment, 
self-management plans, dietetic and psychosocial support and peer support. 
Organisations around the world are committing to work together towards these 
priorities.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is increasingly used for the 
treatment of childhood food allergies, with limited data available on cashew nut 
OIT. This real-life study investigated the safety and feasibility of cashew nut 
OIT, comparing it with peanut OIT, with a focus on the up-dosing process.
METHODS: We analysed cashew nut (n = 24) and peanut (n = 38) OIT cases with 
treatment initiated between 2018 and 2022 at the University Children's Hospital 
Basel. All patients who commenced therapy within this time frame were enrolled 
without prior selection. Two different starting protocols were used. Within the 
up-dosing protocol, the nut intake was incrementally increased by 20-30% every 2 
weeks until reaching a maintenance dose of 1 g of nut protein. After consuming 
the maintenance dose regularly for 18-24 months, a second oral food challenge 
was performed. Patients who passed this challenge were considered desensitised. 
The safety of the therapy was evaluated based on the severity of adverse 
reactions during the up-dosing phase. Symptom severity was evaluated using the 
validated ordinal food allergy severity scale (o-FASS-5).
RESULTS: Over the study period, 33% of cashew nut-allergic and 63% of 
peanut-allergic patients experienced mild to moderate allergic reactions. Severe 
allergic reactions occurred in five peanut-allergic children with high baseline 
allergen-specific IgE levels. Six patients with peanut, and none with cashew nut 
OIT, discontinued the therapy due to adverse reactions. The mean duration to 
reach the maintenance phase was longer for children with asthma or another food 
allergy. Among children who already underwent the second oral food challenge, 
desensitisation was achieved in 91% (11 out of 12) of cashew nut- and 73% (11 
out of 15) of peanut-allergic patients.
CONCLUSION: Cashew nut OIT had a low severity of adverse reactions and was 
generally well-tolerated. However, patient characteristics influenced side 
effect risk and treatment duration, emphasising the need for individualised OIT 
strategies.

IgE antibodies raised against innocuous environmental antigens cause allergic 
diseases like allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and allergic asthma. While some 
allergies are often outgrown, others (peanut, shellfish, tree nut) are lifelong 
in the majority of individuals. Lifelong allergies are the result of persistent 
production of allergen-specific IgE. However, IgE antibodies and the plasma 
cells that secrete them tend to be short-lived. Persistent allergen-specific IgE 
titres are thought to be derived from the continued renewal of IgE plasma cells 
from memory B cells in response to allergen encounters. The initial generation 
of allergen-specific IgE is driven by B cell activation by IL-4 producing Tfh 
cells, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the long-term production of 
IgE are poorly characterized. This review investigates the mechanisms governing 
IgE production and Tfh activation in the primary and recall responses, towards 
the objective of identifying molecular targets for therapeutic intervention that 
durably inactivate the IgE recall response.

This common statement of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology 
(AAAAI) and The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) 
provides an update of the 2012 published guidelines on food challenges. The 
guidelines equally address food challenges in the research and the clinical 
settings. They first address the diagnostic tests which can guide the decision 
to conduct a challenge. Safety of food challenges is prime, and the various 
procedures and safety issues as well as medications potentially involved in 
challenges are extensively discussed. Challenges are suggested to be conducted 
with semi-logarithmic incremental doses based on the protein content, typically 
for IgE-mediated food allergy with intervals of 20-30 min between doses. 
Specific protocols for other types of reactions such atopic dermatitis or 
gastrointestinal food allergy are detailed separately. Proper stopping criteria 
are essential in order to reduce the risk of false-positive diagnoses, but also 
severe reactions. The guidelines recommend criteria based on "go on," "stop," or 
"observation." These revised guidelines will clearly provide much needed 
guidance for food challenges in the research and clinical settings. They will 
continue to evolve with new diagnostic tests or new needs in the field of food 
allergy.

BACKGROUND: Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has become the standard of care for 
children with food allergy (FA) and has substantially improved their quality of 
life. The effect of OIT on the quality of life in adults, however, has been 
studied to a much lesser degree.
METHODS: Patients with food allergy aged ≥ 18 years who underwent OIT at Shamir 
Medical Center completed the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-Adult 
Form (FAQLQ-AF) before and at the end of treatment. Adults with FA not 
undergoing OIT who completed the FAQLQ-AF at 2 time points, served as controls.
RESULTS: A total of 44 adults, median age 23.4 years, who underwent OIT for milk 
(n = 19), egg (n = 2), peanut (n = 9), sesame (n = 6), and tree nuts (n = 8), 
and 11 controls were studied. The median OIT starting dose was 23.8 mg protein. 
33 patients (75%) reached full desensitization within a median of 10.3 months. 
The FAQLQ-AF baseline scores were comparable between the study and control 
groups for all items except for Food Allergy related Health (FAH) item in which 
the study group had a significantly better score (p = 0.02). At the second time 
point, the study group had significantly better scores in all items (Allergen 
Avoidance and Dietary Restrictions (AADR), p = 0.02; and Emotional Impact (EI), 
Risk of Allergen Exposure (RAE), FAH and the Total Score, p < 0.01). The change 
in scores for the study group was significantly better, statistically and 
clinically, in AADR, p = 0.04; EI, p < 0.01; RAE, p = 0.01, and in the total 
score, p = 0.01.
CONCLUSIONS: OIT significantly improves quality of life of adults with FA. This 
finding adds important support for providing OIT in this population.

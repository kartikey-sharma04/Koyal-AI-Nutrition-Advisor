This study aimed to investigate the effect of milk peptides on irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS). The mice were intragastrally administered with casein or whey 
protein hydrolysates at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight/day for 24 days and were 
subjected to Citrobacter rodentium infection and water avoidance stress from day 
7 to 24. Results indicated that casein and whey protein hydrolysates effectively 
reduced diarrhea, anxiety, and visceral hypersensitivity in IBS mice. Casein and 
whey protein hydrolysates regulated gut microbiota composition and increased the 
abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, such as Alloprevotella 
and Alistipes. Whey protein hydrolysate significantly increased the mRNA levels 
of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-1 in the colon, while casein 
hydrolysate significantly improved the mRNA levels of occludin. Casein and whey 
protein hydrolysates both decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), while increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine 
interleukin-10 (IL-10). Importantly, casein and whey protein hydrolysates 
significantly reduced colonic mast cell activation and decreased prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) production. Moreover, three novel casein-derived cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX2)-inhibitory peptides RGPF, FPK, and NPW were identified with IC50 values 
of 0.36 ± 0.03, 0.64 ± 0.01, and 1.10 ± 0.09 mM, respectively and predicted to 
form hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with the residues of the active 
site of COX2. This study highlighted the potential of milk peptides as bioactive 
ingredients in functional foods for managing IBS.

INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition 
significantly affecting quality of life. A small randomised trial showed an 
approximately one-third lower incidence of AD in goat milk formula-fed compared 
with cow milk formula-fed infants. However, due to limited statistical power, AD 
incidence difference was not found to be significant. This study aims to explore 
a potential risk reduction of AD by feeding a formula based on whole goat milk 
(as a source of protein and fat) compared with a formula based on cow milk 
proteins and vegetable oils.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This two-arm (1:1 allocation), parallel, randomised, 
double-blind, controlled nutritional trial shall enrol up to 2296 healthy 
term-born infants until 3 months of age, if parents choose to start formula 
feeding. Ten study centres in Spain and Poland are participating. Randomised 
infants receive investigational infant and follow-on formulas either based on 
whole goat milk or on cow milk until the age of 12 months. The goat milk formula 
has a whey:casein ratio of 20:80 and about 50% of the lipids are milk fat from 
whole goat milk, whereas the cow milk formula, used as control, has a 
whey:casein ratio of 60:40 and 100% of the lipids are from vegetable oils. The 
energy and nutrient levels in both goat and cow milk formulas are the same. The 
primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of AD until the age of 12 months 
diagnosed by study personnel based on the UK Working Party Diagnostic Criteria. 
The secondary endpoints include reported AD diagnosis, measures of AD, blood and 
stool markers, child growth, sleep, nutrition and quality of life. Participating 
children are followed until the age of 5 years.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical 
committees of all participating institutions.

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID) comprise a spectrum of 
inflammatory diseases that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. 
The pathogenesis of these conditions is complex; differentiating between primary 
and secondary forms of these disorders can be clinically challenging. We report 
a case of primary EGID in a patient with remote parasite exposure, whose 
symptoms were initially attributed to irritable bowel syndrome. Endoscopy 
revealed the rare finding of EGID involving the entire gastrointestinal tract; 
symptoms improved with an elimination diet. This case raises the possibility of 
a link between prior parasite exposure and development of EGID, and underscores 
the necessity of exploring alternative diagnoses in patients with presumed IBS 
who present with severe symptoms.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifaceted illness involving maladaptive 
shifts in the gut microbiota that affect the enteric nervous and immune systems, 
mucosal barrier function, the balance of neurotransmitters and hormones, and 
emotional well-being. There is abundant evidence indicating that certain foods 
elicit symptoms in IBS. Numerous elimination-type diets have been shown to 
alleviate symptoms. However, among these, the most controversial is a group of 
foods called fructo, oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs). 
This paper reviews the role of diet and systematically analyze the literature 
for the role of FODMAPs in IBS.

BACKGROUND: The first British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines for the 
dietary management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in adults were published in 
2012. Subsequently, there has been a wealth of new research. The aim of this 
work was to systematically review the evidence for the role of diet in the 
management of IBS and to update the guidelines.
METHODS: Twelve questions relating to diet and IBS were defined based on review 
of the previous guideline questions, current evidence and clinical practice. 
Chosen topics were on healthy eating and lifestyle (alcohol, caffeine, spicy 
food, elimination diets, fat and fluid intakes and dietary habits), milk and 
dairy, dietary fibre, fermentable carbohydrates, gluten, probiotics and 
elimination diets/food hypersensitivity. Data sources were CINAHL, Cochrane 
Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science up to 
October 2015. Studies were assessed independently in duplicate using risk of 
bias tools specific to each included study based on inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for each question. National Health and Medical Research Council grading 
evidence levels were used to develop evidence statements and recommendations, in 
accordance with Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition Global protocol used by the 
BDA.
RESULTS: Eighty-six studies were critically appraised to generate 46 evidence 
statements, 15 clinical recommendations and four research recommendations. The 
IBS dietary algorithm was simplified to first-line (healthy eating, provided by 
any healthcare professional) and second-line [low FODMAP (fermentable 
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) to be provided by 
dietitian] dietary advice.
CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide updated comprehensive evidence-based 
details to achieve the successful dietary management of IBS in adults.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an increased prevalence of irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS) after acute gastroenteritis. Food as a precipitating and 
perpetuating factor in IBS has gained recent interest, but food intolerance 
following gastroenteritis is less investigated. The aims of this study were 
firstly, to compare perceived food intolerance in a group previously exposed to 
Giardia lamblia with a control group; secondly, to explore the relation with IBS 
status; and thirdly, to investigate associations with content of fermentable 
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) in foods 
reported.
METHODS: This is a historical cohort study with mailed questionnaire to 1252 
Giardia exposed and a control cohort matched by gender and age. Differences 
between groups were investigated using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate in the exposed group was 65.3 % 
(817/1252) and in the control group 31.4 % (1128/3598). The adjusted odds ratio 
(OR) for perceived food intolerance for the exposed group was 2.00 with 95 % 
confidence interval (CI): 1.65 to 2.42, as compared with the control group. 
Perceived intolerance for dairy products was the most frequently reported 
intolerance, with an adjusted OR for the exposed of 1.95 (95 % CI: 1.51 to 
2.51). Perceived intolerance for fatty foods, vegetables, fruit, cereals and 
alcohol was also significantly higher in the exposed group. The groups did not 
differ in perceived intolerance to spicy foods, coffee or soda. The association 
between exposure to Giardia infection and perceived food intolerance differed 
between the IBS group and the no-IBS group, but IBS was not a significant effect 
modifier for the association. Perceived intolerance for high FODMAP foods 
(adjusted OR 1.91) and low FODMAP foods (adjusted OR 1.55) was significantly 
associated with exposure status.
CONCLUSION: Exposure to Giardia infection was associated with perceived food 
intolerance 3 years after giardiasis. IBS status did not alter the association 
between exposure status and perceived food intolerance. Perceived intolerance to 
high FODMAP foods and low FODMAP foods were both statistically significantly 
associated with exposure to Giardia infection.

Potential role of the intestinal microbiota in programming health and disease.

The composition of the microbiota varies according to prenatal events, delivery 
methods, infant feeding, infant care environment, and antibiotic use. Postnatal 
gut function and immune development are largely influenced by the intestinal 
microbiota. Emerging evidence has shown that early microbiota colonization may 
influence the occurrence of later diseases (microbial programming). The vast 
majority of microbial species (commensals) give rise to symbiotic host-bacterial 
interactions that are fundamental for human health. However, changes in the 
composition of the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) may be associated with several 
clinical conditions, including obesity and metabolic diseases, autoimmune 
diseases and allergy, acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS), allergic gastroenteritis (e.g., eosinophilic gastroenteritis and 
allergic IBS), and necrotizing enterocolitis. Based on recent advances, 
modulation of gut microbiota with probiotics, prebiotics, or fermented dairy 
products has been suggested as a treatment of, or prevention for, different 
disorders such as IBS, infectious diarrhea, allergic disease, and necrotizing 
enterocolitis.

About two-thirds of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients associate their 
symptoms with certain foods. We reviewed food-related factors putatively 
associated with manifestations of IBS. Soluble fiber may improve constipation 
but frequently increases bloating and abdominal pain. Carbohydrate malabsorption 
seems to be more frequent in IBS. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, 
disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet significantly reduces IBS 
symptoms and has been suggested as a therapeutic option. Serological screening 
for celiac disease should be done in patients without constipation. Moreover, 
non-celiac disease gluten sensitivity, defined as gluten intolerance once celiac 
disease and wheat allergy have been ruled out, should be considered in these 
patients. There is no specific diet for IBS patients but small and frequent 
meals, avoiding greasy foods, dairy products, many carbohydrates, caffeine and 
alcohol, is recommended.

OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that food and diet are central issues, that concern 
patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the current understanding about 
the association between the intake of certain foods/food groups and the 
gastrointestinal (GI) symptom pattern, psychological symptoms, and quality of 
life is poor. The aim of this study was to determine which food groups and 
specific food items IBS patients report causing GI symptoms, and to investigate 
the association with GI and psychological symptoms and quality of life.
METHODS: We included 197 IBS patients (mean age 35 (18-72) years; 142 female 
subjects) who completed a food questionnaire in which they specified symptoms 
from 56 different food items or food groups relevant to food 
intolerance/allergy. The patients also completed questionnaires to assess 
depression and general anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression), GI-specific 
anxiety (Visceral Sensitivity Index), IBS symptoms (IBS-Severity Scoring 
System), somatic symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-15), and quality of life 
(Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life Questionnaire).
RESULTS: In all, 84% of the studied population reported symptoms related to at 
least one of the food items surveyed. Symptoms related to intake of food items 
with incompletely absorbed carbohydrates were noted in 138 (70%) patients; the 
most common were dairy products (49%), beans/lentils (36%), apple (28%), flour 
(24%), and plum (23%). Of these, 58% experienced GI symptoms from foods rich in 
biogenic amines, such as wine/beer (31%), salami (22%), and cheese (20%). 
Histamine-releasing foods, such as milk (43%), wine/beer (31%), and pork (21%), 
were also considered causes of symptoms in IBS patients. GI symptoms were also 
frequently reported after intake of fried and fatty foods (52%). With increasing 
IBS symptom severity, patients reported more food items responsible for their GI 
symptoms (P=0.004), and this was also found in patients with more severe somatic 
symptoms (P<0.0001). Women tended to report more food items causing symptoms 
than men (P=0.06). A high number of food items causing GI symptoms was also 
associated with reduced quality of life and this was significant for the 
following domains: sleep (r=-0.25; P=0.001), energy (r=-0.21; P=0.005), food 
(r=-0.29; P<0.001), social functioning (r=-0.23; P=0.001), and physical status 
(r=-0.16; P<0.05). However, the number of food items reported to provoke GI 
symptoms was unrelated to body mass index, age, IBS subtype, anxiety, 
depression, or GI-specific anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of IBS patients believe that certain food items are 
important triggers of their GI symptoms. This is especially true for foods 
containing carbohydrates and fat, and also may be relevant for 
histamine-releasing food items and foods rich in biogenic amines. Self-reported 
food intolerance is associated with high symptom burden and reduced quality of 
life.

BACKGROUND:   Fermented milk (FM) containing Bifidobacterium lactis CNCM I-2494 
and yogurt strains improves irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in 
constipated IBS patients. In rats, stressful events exacerbate IBS symptoms and 
result in the alteration of gut sensitivity and permeability via epithelial cell 
cytoskeleton contraction. In a stress model, we aimed at evaluating the effect 
of B. lactis CNCM I-2494 as a pure strain or contained in an FM product on 
visceral sensitivity and the impact of this FM on intestinal barrier integrity.
METHODS:   Visceral sensitivity was analyzed in rats subjected to partial 
restraint stress (PRS). Rats received during 15 days the B. lactis as a pure 
strain (10(6) to 10(10) CFU mL(-1)), B. lactis in an FM product (10(8) CFU 
g(-1), diluted or not), or a control product. Gut paracellular permeability, 
colonic occluding and Jam-A proteins, and blood endotoxin levels were determined 
in rats receiving B. lactis in an FM product submitted or not to a PRS.
KEY RESULTS:   The FM product showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on 
stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity. A similar antihyperalgesic effect was 
observed at 10(10) CFU mL(-1) of pure B. lactis administration. The FM product 
prevented the increase in intestinal permeability induced by PRS and restored 
occludin and JAM-A expressions to control levels. The FM product abolished the 
increase concentration of blood endotoxin induced by PRS.
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES:   This study illustrates that a probiotic food 
containing B. lactis CNCM I-2494 strain reduces visceral hypersensitivity

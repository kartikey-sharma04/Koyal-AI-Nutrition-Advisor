AIM: To determine the effect of maternal egg consumption during lactation on the 
development of egg allergies in 12-month-old infants. We hypothesized that 
infants whose mothers consume larger amounts of eggs during the early lactation 
period acquire oral immune tolerance and are less likely to develop egg 
allergies at 12 months.
METHODS: This study was a part of the Japan Pregnancy Eating and Activity Cohort 
Study. Mothers answered questionnaires on egg consumption, breastfeeding rates 
at 1 month, infants' eczema at 6 months, and the development of egg allergies 
among infants at 12 months. In order to assess the actual impact of maternal egg 
consumption on infants' egg allergy development, breastfeeding-dependent egg 
consumption was calculated at 1 month by multiplying maternal egg consumption at 
1 month with the breastfeeding rates at the same time. Logistic regression 
analysis was performed to examine the potential risk and protective factors.
RESULTS: Data from 420 infants were analyzed, of whom 27 had egg allergies at 
12 months. No significant impact of breastfeeding-dependent egg consumption was 
observed on infants' egg allergy development at 12 months. However, infants with 
eczema at 6 months showed a greater risk of developing an egg allergy at 
12 months (adjusted odds ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-8.13).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that breastfeeding-dependent egg consumption at 
1 month did not contribute to sufficient oral immune tolerance in 12-month-old 
infants. Eczema at 6 months significantly impacted the development of an egg 
allergy, emphasizing the importance of preventing cutaneous exposure to egg 
allergens.

BACKGROUND: The use of blood specific IgE or skin prick tests (SPT) to guide 
dietary exclusions for disease control in children with atopic dermatitis (AD) 
is controversial. We undertook a consensus exercise on how to interpret SPT 
results and dietary history for cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, and soy in 
children < 2 years old with AD.
METHODS: Fourteen clinicians from general practice, pediatrics, pediatric 
dermatology, pediatric allergy, and pediatric dietetics from UK and Ireland took 
part in an online modified Delphi study. Over three rounds, participants gave 
their anonymous opinions and received individualized and group feedback, based 
on the premise that all children had SPTs. The findings were discussed in an 
online workshop.
RESULTS: Of 18 symptoms, 12 were identified as relevant to immediate and 7 to 
delayed allergy. Regarding SPTs, there was consensus over which allergens to use 
for wheat and soy but not cow's milk or hen's egg; for all study foods, wheal 
size was determined as 0-1 mm negative, ≥ 5 mm sensitized, but between 2 and 
4 mm, categorization varied by food. During the final workshop, consensus was 
reached on dietary advice for nine combinations of SPT results and dietary 
history.
CONCLUSION: We attained consensus on how SPTs and dietary history for four 
common food allergens should be interpreted in young children under 2 years of 
age with AD. These pragmatic recommendations may support clinician education, 
consistency of decision-making, and future research.

BACKGROUND: The role of air pollution in eczema and food allergy development 
remains understudied.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether exposure to air pollution is associated 
with eczema and food allergies in the first 10 years of life.
METHODS: HealthNuts recruited a population-based sample of 1-year-old infants 
who were followed up at ages 4, 6, and 10 years. Annual average fine particulate 
matter (particulate matter with diameter of 2.5 μm or less, or PM2.5) and 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposures were assigned to geocoded residential 
addresses. Eczema was defined by parent report. Oral food challenges to peanut, 
egg, and sesame were used to measure food allergy. Multilevel logistic 
regression models were fitted, and estimates were reported as adjusted odds 
ratios.
RESULTS: Those exposed to high concentration of NO2 (<10 ppb) at age 1 year had 
higher peanut allergy prevalence at ages 1 (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence 
interval], 2.21 [1.40-3.48]) and 4 (2.29 [1.28-4.11]) years. High exposure to 
NO2 at 6 years old were associated with higher peanut allergy prevalence at age 
6 (1.34 [1.00-1.82] per 2.7 ppb NO2 increase) years. Similarly, increased PM2.5 
at age 1 year was associated with peanut allergy at ages 4, 6, and 10 years 
(respectively, 1.27 [1.01-1.60], 1.27 [1.01-1.56], and 1.46 [1.05-2.04] per 1.2 
μg/m PM2.5 increase) years. We found that increased concentrations of NO2 or 
PM2.5 at age 1 year were associated with persistent peanut allergy at later 
ages. Little evidence of associations was observed with eczema or with egg 
allergy.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-life exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with peanut 
allergy prevalence and persistence. Policies aiming at reducing air pollution 
could potentially reduce presence and persistence of peanut allergy.

RATIONALE: Eczematous external otitis (EEO) is the most difficult-to-treat 
otitis externa, and characterized by the symptoms of inflammation with 
hypersensitivity of the external ear canal skin. It is acknowledged as a chronic 
skin inflammation primarily caused by dermatological and allergic reactions. 
Food allergens are also considered a cause to induce the inflammation. However, 
the role of food specific IgG4 in this disease is unclear yet.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old woman complained of recurrent itching of the 
external auditory meatus for 3 years and nails chapping of hands for 2 years.
DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: She was diagnosed with EEO and underwent the 
therapeutic strategy as food elimination of egg, milk and wheat, guided by the 
result of food specific IgG4 together with probiotics on the basis of previous 
symptom controlling therapy.
OUTCOMES: After 17 months' treatment, she was finally free of all the symptoms 
and the serum IgG4 specific to all foods are under normal limit.
LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report revealing the 
clinical significance of food specific IgG4 in EEO, and the successful treatment 
with diet elimination guided by food specific IgG4 threw a new light on the 
clinical management of refractory EEO.

The impact of food matrices on egg allergenicity.

Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.

BACKGROUND: Although many studies show the impact of high and prolonged heating 
on allergenicity, scarce research exists that examined the impact of the food 
matrix effect. We presented a case that demonstrates the need for further 
investigation into this field.
CASE: An 8-month-old breast-fed girl with a history of moderate eczema presented 
with concern for food allergy. At 7 months old, she seemed to have difficulty 
with nursing after consumption of peanut butter, and her pediatrician 
recommended further avoidance. On presentation to allergy, she had not yet 
consumed eggs; therefore, skin testing was obtained for both peanut and egg. Her 
skin testing result to peanut was negative, whereas to egg was elevated at 5/20 
mm. To further support clinical decision-making, blood work was obtained, and 
the egg white specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) value was elevated to 1.33 kU/L. 
It was recommended to the family to pursue home introduction of peanut and 
return for oral challenge to baked egg. At 14 months old, the patient returned 
for oral challenge and successfully tolerated one-half of a muffin. She was 
discharged with instructions to continue consumption of one-half of a muffin 
ideally three or more times a week, which the parents reported she continued to 
tolerate.
CONCLUSION: When the patient was 24 months old, the mother decided, without 
consultation, to introduce banana-chocolate chip muffins. With the first two 
ingestions, she developed immediate urticaria. On the third consumption, she 
developed anaphylaxis, which required epinephrine, with rapid improvement. The 
patient subsequently returned to regular consumption of standard egg muffins (as 
well as bananas and chocolate individually), which she continued to tolerate. 
Based on our patient's ability to tolerate baked egg muffins without banana but 
significant reaction to baked egg muffins with banana, a potential explanation 
is that the addition of banana disrupted the egg-wheat matrix. This report 
points toward a continued need to investigate the role food matrices play on the 
allergenicity of foods. Furthermore, this case demonstrated the importance of 
adhering to allergist-prescribed recipes to prevent allergic reactions.

BACKGROUND: Infant feeding guidelines in Australia changed in 2016 to recommend 
introducing common allergy-causing foods by age 1 year to prevent food allergy. 
Although most Australian infants now eat peanut and egg by age 6 months, some 
still develop food allergy despite the early introduction of allergens.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence of food allergy in a cohort recruited 
after introducing the nationwide allergy prevention recommendations; identify 
characteristics of infants who developed allergy despite early introduction of 
allergens; and estimate the causal effect of modifiable exposures on food 
allergy prevalence and whether this differed between infants who were introduced 
to allergens before or after age 6 months.
METHODS: We recruited a population-based sample of 12-month-old infants in 
Melbourne, Australia. Infants had skin prick tests to four foods and parents 
completed questionnaires. Infants with evidence of sensitization were offered 
oral food challenges. Prevalence estimates were adjusted using inverse 
probability weighting.
RESULTS: In a cohort of infants (n = 1,420) in which nearly all infants had been 
introduced to common allergens such as egg, milk, and peanut by age 1 year, the 
prevalence of food allergy remained high at 11.3% (95% CI, 9.6-13.4). Infants 
who developed food allergy despite introduction of the allergen by age 6 months 
were more likely to have Asian-born parents. Early-onset moderate or severe 
eczema was associated with an increased odds of food allergy irrespective of 
whether allergens were introduced before or after age 6 months. Among infants 
who were introduced to peanut at age 6 months or earlier, antibiotic use by age 
6 months was associated with an increased odds of peanut allergy (adjusted odds 
ratio = 6.03; 95% CI, 1.15-31.60).
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort in which early allergen introduction was common, the 
prevalence of food allergy remained high. Infants who developed food allergy 
despite introduction of the respective allergen by age 6 months were more likely 
to have had Asian parents and early-onset eczema. New interventions are needed 
for infants with a phenotype of food allergy that is not amenable to early 
allergen introduction.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data regarding the early introduction of the 
consumption of allergenic food among Asian infants.
METHODS: We examined infants who had early-onset eczema before 6 months of age 
and received instructions from certified allergists for the early introduction 
of hen's eggs, milk, wheat, peanuts, and tree nuts.
RESULTS: The consumption rates of hen's eggs were 100% at 24 months. For peanuts 
and walnuts, the consumption rate was moderate at 12 months (48.5% and 30.3%, 
respectively), but by 24 months, it had progressed to 78.8% and 81.3%, 
respectively. In contrast, cashews remained at lower levels than other allergens 
at 20.7% at 12 months and 41.4% at 24 months. No adverse events related to early 
introductions occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In infants with eczema, allergenic foods could be introduced early 
and well tolerated in Asian infants. However, having eczema may indicate a 
predisposition to food allergies, so caution is necessary when introducing 
allergenic foods. The early introduction of peanuts and tree nuts was still more 
challenging in real-world practice in Asia as well as in Western countries.

BACKGROUND: Increasing studies linked outdoor air pollution (OAP), indoor 
environmental factors (IEFs), and antibiotics use (AU) with the first wave of 
allergies (i.e., asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema), yet the role of their 
exposures on children's second wave of allergy (i.e., food allergy) are unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between exposure to OAP and IEFs and 
childhood doctor-diagnosed food allergy (DFA) during the pre-pregnancy, 
prenatal, early postnatal, and current periods, and to further explore the 
effect of OAP and IEFs on DFA in children co-exposed to antibiotics.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving 8689 preschoolers was carried 
out in Changsha, China. Data on the health outcomes, antibiotic use, and home 
environment of each child were collected through a questionnaire. Temperature 
and air pollutants data were obtained from 8 and 10 monitoring stations in 
Changsha, respectively. Exposure levels to temperature and air pollutants at 
individual home addresses were calculated by the inverse distance weighted (IDW) 
method. Multiple logistic regression models were employed to assess the 
associations of childhood DFA with exposure to OAP, IEF, and AU.
RESULTS: Childhood ever doctor-diagnosed food allergy (DFA) was linked to 
postnatal PM10 exposure with OR (95% CI) of 1.18 (1.03-1.36), especially for CO 
and O3 exposure during the first year with ORs (95% CI) = 1.08 (1.00-1.16) and 
1.07 (1.00-1.14), as well as SO2 exposure during the previous year with OR (95% 
CI) of 1.13 (1.02-1.25). The role of postnatal air pollution is more important 
for the risk of egg, milk and other food allergies. Renovation-related IAP (new 
furniture) and dampness-related indoor allergens exposures throughout all time 
windows significantly increased the risk of childhood DFA, with ORs ranging from 
1.23 (1.03-1.46) to 1.54 (1.29-1.83). Furthermore, smoke-related IAP 
(environmental tobacco smoke [ETS], parental and grandparental smoking) exposure 
during pregnancy, first year, and previous year was related to DFA. 
Additionally, exposure to pet-related indoor allergens (cats) during first year 
and total plant-related allergens (particularly nonflowering plants) during 
previous year were associated with DFA. Moreover, exposure to plant-related 
allergy during first and previous year was specifically associated with milk 
allergy, while keeping cats during first year increased the risk of 
fruits/vegetables allergy. Life-time and early-life AU was associated with the 
increased risk of childhood DFA with ORs (95% CI) = 1.57 (1.32-1.87) and 1.46 
(1.27-1.67), including different types food allergies except fruit/vegetable 
allergy.
CONCLUSIONS: Postnatal OAP, life-time and early-life IEFs and AU exposure played 
a vital role in the development of DFA, supporting the "fetal origin of 
childhood FA" hypothesis.

BACKGROUND: Children with sensitization against foods have to be orally 
food-challenged before eating these foods for the first time. However, the 
waiting time for an oral food challenge (OFC) in Germany is about 3-6 months. In 
contrast, there are hints that an early introduction of allergenic foods might 
be protective regarding the development of food allergy. The aim of this 
clinical trial is therefore to investigate, whether an introduction and regular 
consumption of small amounts of food allergens is safe and will result in an 
increase of tolerance in children with sensitization against food allergens with 
unknown clinical relevance.
METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center 
trial, 138 children (8 months to 4 years of age) sensitized to the target 
allergen(s) hen's egg, cow's milk, peanuts, and/or hazelnuts with unknown 
clinical relevance will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an active or a 
placebo group, daily receiving a rusk-like biscuit powder with or without the 
target allergen(s) for 3-6 months until an OFC will be performed in routine 
diagnostics. The primary endpoint is an IgE-mediated food allergy to the primary 
target allergen, after the interventional period.
DISCUSSION: Children with sensitization against food allergens with unknown 
clinical relevance often have to avoid the corresponding foods for several 
months until an OFC is performed. Therefore, the "window of opportunity" for an 
early preventive introduction of allergenic foods might be missed. This trial 
will assess whether an introduction of small allergen amounts will favor 
tolerance development in these children.

BACKGROUND: Introducing peanut products early can prevent peanut allergy (PA). 
The "Addendum guidelines for the prevention of PA in the United States" (PPA 
guidelines) recommend early introduction of peanut products to low and moderate 
risk infants and evaluation prior to starting peanut products for infants at 
high risk for PA (those with severe eczema and/or egg allergy). Rapid adoption 
of guidelines could aid in lowering the prevalence of PA. The Intervention to 
Reduce Early (Peanut) Allergy in Children (iREACH) trial was designed to promote 
PPA guideline adherence by pediatric clinicians.
METHODS: A two-arm, cluster-randomized, controlled clinical trial was designed 
to measure the effectiveness of an intervention that included clinician 
education and accompanying clinical decision support tools integrated in 
electronic health records (EHR) versus standard care. Randomization was at the 
practice level (n = 30). Primary aims evaluated over an 18-month trial period 
assess adherence to the PPA guidelines using EHR documentation at 4- and 6-month 
well-child care visits aided by natural language processing. A secondary aim 
will evaluate the effectiveness in decreasing the incidence of PA by age 
2.5 years using EHR documentation and caregiver surveys. The unit of observation 
for evaluations are individual children with clustering at the practice level.
CONCLUSION: Application of this intervention has the potential to inform the 
development of strategies to speed implementation of PPA guidelines.

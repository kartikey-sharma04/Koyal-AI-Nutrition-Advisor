OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the occurrence of sleep-related breathing 
disorders (SRBDs) in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH) and addressed the effect of pulmonary hemodynamics and SRBD indices on 
the severity of nocturnal hypoxemia (NH).
METHODS: An overnight polysomnography (PSG) was conducted in patients with 
CTEPH, who were eligible for pulmonary endarterectomy. Pulmonary hemodynamics 
(mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure 
(PAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) measured with right heart 
catheterization (RHC)), PSG variables (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)), lung 
function and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) values, as well as 
demographics and comorbidities were entered into a logistic regression model to 
address the determinants of severe NH (nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) 
< 90% under >20% of total sleep time (TST)). SRBDs were defined as obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA; as an AHI ≥ 15 events/h), central sleep apnea with 
Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR; CSR pattern ≥ 50% of TST), obesity 
hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and isolated sleep-related hypoxemia (ISRH; SpO2 
< 88% under >5 min without OSA, CSA, or OHS).
RESULTS: In all, 50 consecutive patients (34 men and 16 women; mean age 54.0 (SD 
15.1) years) were included. The average mPAP was 43.8 (SD 16.8) mmHg. SRBD was 
observed in 40 (80%) patients, of whom 27 had OSA, 2 CSA-CSR, and 11 ISRH. None 
had OHS. Severe NH was observed in 31 (62%) patients. Among the variables 
tested, age (odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.15; p = 
0.031), mPAP (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.02-1.12; p = 0.012]), and AHI (OR 1.17 [95% CI 
1.02-1.35; p = 0.031]) were independent determinants of severe NH.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe NH is highly prevalent in patients with CTEPH. Early 
screening for SRBDs and intervention with nocturnal supplemental oxygen and/or 
positive airway pressure as well as pulmonary endarterectomy may reduce adverse 
outcomes in patients with CTEPH.

Soy and red clover for mid-life and aging.

INTRODUCTION: Menopause is associated with mid-life, a time when many women 
begin to experience the signs and symptoms of aging, such as increases in blood 
pressure, changes in lipid profiles, loss of bone mass density, and diminished 
memory and cognition. Given the result of the Women's Health Initiative, many 
women no longer consider hormone therapy the first option for promoting healthy 
aging. Instead, they are turning to botanical and dietary supplement (BDS) 
products in place of hormone therapy. This paper reviews the evidence available 
for use of isoflavones from soy and red clover for the treatment or prevention 
of these health issues.
METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles relating to 
soy or red clover supplement use for prevention and/or treatment of heart 
disease, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, mood disorders and cognitive abilities. 
Studies were included if they were randomized, controlled trials and included 
peri- or postmenopausal women.
RESULTS: Isoflavone products appear to be the most useful for improving lipid 
profiles; however, the evidence suggests that isoflavone extracts from soy are 
less effective than products containing soy protein or red clover isoflavones. 
Soy protein appears to reduce levels of total cholesterol and low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, while red clover reduces levels of triglycerides and 
increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The data were somewhat less 
convincing, although promising, for increasing bone mass density and improving 
cognitive abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Research suggests that isoflavones found in soy foods and red 
clover appear to have a small but positive health effect on plasma lipid 
concentrations, bone mass density, and cognitive abilities. Given the lack of 
serious safety concerns in the short term, it would appear that including soy 
and red clover in the diet of postmenopausal women, not withstanding a soy 
allergy, might be beneficial.

Breast milk contains hormones, growth factors, cytokines, cells, etc., and 
offers many advantages over cow's milk or soy protein infant formulae. The 
composition of breast milk is influenced by gestational and postnatal age. 
Prevalence of breastfeeding in France is one of the lowest in Europe: in 2003, 
only 58% of infants were breastfed when leaving the maternity ward, for a median 
duration of 10 weeks. Breastfeeding allows normal growth until at least 6 months 
of age, and can be prolonged until the age of 2 years or more, provided that 
complementary feeding is started after 6 months. Breastfeeding is associated 
with slightly enhanced performance on tests of cognitive development. Exclusive 
breastfeeding for at least 3 months is associated with a lower incidence and 
severity of diarrhoea, otitis media and respiratory infection. Exclusive 
breastfeeding for at least 6 months is associated with a lower incidence of 
allergic disease in at-risk infants (infants with at least one first-degree 
relative presenting with allergy). Breastfeeding is also associated with a lower 
incidence of obesity during childhood and adolescence, as well as with a lower 
incidence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in adulthood. Maternal 
infection with hepatitis B and C virus is not a contraindication to 
breastfeeding, as opposed to HIV infection and galactosemia. A supplementation 
with vitamin D and K is necessary in the breastfed infant. Very few medications 
contraindicate breastfeeding. Premature babies can be breastfed and/or receive 
mother's milk and/or bank milk, provided they receive energy, protein and 
mineral supplements. Return to prepregnancy weight is earlier in breastfeeding 
mothers. Breastfeeding is also associated with a decreased risk of breast and 
ovarian cancer in the premenopausal period, and of hip fractures and 
osteoporosis in the postmenopausal period.

BACKGROUND: Legumes belonging to the family Fabaceae of the order Fabales are a 
widely consumed source of protein. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions to 
legumes have been described, the most studied allergens being peanuts and 
soybeans. In the Mediterranean region and India, lentils, chickpeas and peas 
have been considered important allergens and legumes have been reported to 
represent the fifth most common cause of food allergy in children under 5 years 
of age in Spain. In Latin America, there are few reports of allergy to legumes 
other than peanuts, and these are especially in the paediatric population.
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of IgE-mediated legume allergy in an adult female 
patient.
CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 65-year-old female patient who reports a 
20-year history of generalized urticaria, accompanied by angioedema and dyspnea 
occurring immediately after consumption of lentils, beans, chickpeas, soya beans 
and cold meats, requiring admission to the emergency department for this cause. 
Tolerates peanuts. She does not report anaphylaxis in any context other than 
those described. He has presented generalized pruritus with exposure to fumes 
from cooking beans. Pathological history: Hypertension, type II diabetes 
mellitus, hypothyroidism. Allergic: Anaphylaxis due to penicillin at the age of 
30. Other history: extensive local reaction to hymenoptera sting. Prick test 
trophoallergens: soya 3 mm. Prick to prick protein based on commercial soybean 
7mm, chickpea 5mm, lentil 6mm and bean 7mm. He was negative for wheat and peanut 
(Image 1) (Attached in separate file). It has a normal tryptase report. 
Indication was given for adequate adrenaline and strict avoidance of legumes, 
except peanuts.
CONCLUSIONS: Legume allergy is little known in our environment and mainly 
affects children. Clinical manifestations include mild reactions and 
anaphylaxis. A high degree of cross-reactivity among legumes has been reported. 
Lentils have cross-reactivity with chickpeas and beans. Peanut allergy may also 
be associated with allergy to lentils, chickpeas, and peas, but is less 
frequently reported.

Publisher: ANTECEDENTES: Las leguminosas pertenecientes a la familia Fabaceae 
del orden Fabales, son una fuente de proteína de amplio consumo. Se han descrito 
reacciones de hipersensibilidad mediadas por IgE a las leguminosas, siendo los 
alérgenos más estudiados el maní y la soya. En la región mediterránea y en 
India, las lentejas, garbanzos y arvejas se han considerado alérgenos 
importantes, y se ha informado que las leguminosas representan la quinta causa 
más común de alergia alimentaria en niños menores de cinco años en España. En 
América Latina, hay pocos reportes de alergia a las leguminosas diferentes al 
maní, y éstos son, especialmente, en población pediátrica.
OBJETIVO: Describir el caso de alergia mediada por IgE a leguminosas, en una 
paciente adulta.
REPORTE DE CASO: Se describe el caso de una paciente de 65 años, quien reporta 
un cuadro de 20 años con evolución consistente de urticaria generalizada, 
acompañada de angioedema y disnea, que ocurre, en forma inmediata, tras el 
consumo lentejas, fríjoles, garbanzos, soya y carnes frías; y requiere de 
ingresos al servicio de urgencias por esta causa. Tolera maní. No se reporta 
anafilaxia en otro contexto diferente a los descritos. Ha presentado prurito 
generalizado con la exposición a vapores de la cocción de fríjoles. Antecedentes 
patológicos: hipertensión arterial, diabetes mellitus tipo II, hipotiroidismo. 
Alérgicos: Anafilaxia por Penicilina a los 30 años. Otros antecedentes: Reacción 
local extensa con picadura de himenópteros. Prick test trofoalérgenos: soya 3 
mm. Prick to prick proteína a base de soya comercial 7mm, garbanzo 5mm, lenteja 
6mm y fríjol 7mm. Fue negativa para trigo y maní (Imagen 1). (Adjunta en archivo 
separado). Tiene reporte de triptasa normal. Se dio indicación de porte adecuado 
de adrenalina y evitación estricta de leguminosas, excepto maní.
CONCLUSIONES: La alergia a las leguminosas es poco conocida en nuestro medio, y 
afecta principalmente a los niños. Sus manifestaciones clínicas incluyen 
reacciones leves y anafilaxia. Se ha informado, un alto grado de reactividad 
cruzada entre las leguminosas. Las lentejas tienen reactividad cruzada con 
garbanzos y fríjoles. La alergia al maní también puede estar asociada con la 
alergia a lentejas, garbanzos y guisantes, pero se informa con menos frecuencia.

Wheat is an important staple food globally, providing a significant contribution 
to daily energy, fiber, and micronutrient intake. Observational evidence for 
health impacts of consuming more whole grains, among which wheat is a major 
contributor, points to significant risk reduction for diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and colon cancer. However, specific wheat components may also elicit 
adverse physical reactions in susceptible individuals such as celiac disease 
(CD) and wheat allergy (WA). Recently, broad coverage in the popular and social 
media has suggested that wheat consumption leads to a wide range of adverse 
health effects. This has motivated many consumers to avoid or reduce their 
consumption of foods that contain wheat/gluten, despite the absence of diagnosed 
CD or WA, raising questions about underlying mechanisms and possible nocebo 
effects. However, recent studies did show that some individuals may suffer from 
adverse reactions in absence of CD and WA. This condition is called non-celiac 
gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). In addition to 
gluten, wheat and derived products contain many other components which may 
trigger symptoms, including inhibitors of α-amylase and trypsin (ATIs), lectins, 
and rapidly fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs). Furthermore, the way in which 
foods are being processed, such as the use of yeast or sourdough fermentation, 
fermentation time and baking conditions, may also affect the presence and 
bioactivity of these components. The present review systematically describes the 
characteristics of wheat-related intolerances, including their etiology, 
prevalence, the components responsible, diagnosis, and strategies to reduce 
adverse reactions.

To ascertain the knowledge, awareness, and practices pertaining to celiac 
disease (CD) among the Indian pediatricians. A survey link containing a 
questionnaire was shared through electronic mail using a pediatric database. The 
survey was kept active for 6 months; all responses received at the end of the 
survey were analyzed. Two hundred and seventy one pediatricians out of more than 
10,000 chose to respond to the survey. Most pediatricians agreed that more 
patients with CD are being diagnosed than earlier. The reasons for higher 
detection of CD were perceived to be higher index of clinical suspicion by 
pediatricians (86.7%) followed by increased awareness among parents (45.8%). 
Most pediatricians opined that clinical manifestations which prompted to a 
diagnosis of CD were failure to thrive (96.2%) and chronic diarrhea (81.4%). 
Knowledge about atypical manifestations of celiac disease was low.  Though 
knowledge about the common association of CD with type 1 diabetes (62.1%) and 
autoimmune hepatitis (55.8%) was there, awareness about its association with 
other uncommon conditions was lacking. Though 68% of the pediatricians were of 
the opinion that the confirmation of diagnosis by a mucosal biopsy is necessary, 
26.5% of respondents believed that only a positive serology was sufficient for a 
diagnosis. A trial of gluten-free diet (GFD) was thought to be a logical step if 
serology was positive by 31.3% of respondents. While 87.7% of pediatricians 
advocated lifelong adherence to GFD, 12.3% felt that GFD could be discontinued 
in the future. This web-based survey revealed that though pediatricians are 
seeing increasing number of celiac disease patients, there is a need to increase 
awareness regarding the disease, its associated conditions, the need for mucosal 
biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and the necessity of lifelong adherence to GFD.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Wheat-related disorders, a spectrum of conditions induced by 
the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals, have been increasing in prevalence. 
Patients with celiac disease have gluten-specific immune responses, but the 
contribution of non-gluten proteins to symptoms in patients with celiac disease 
or other wheat-related disorders is controversial.
METHODS: C57BL/6 (control), Myd88-/-, Ticam1-/-, and Il15-/- mice were placed on 
diets that lacked wheat or gluten, with or without wheat amylase trypsin 
inhibitors (ATIs), for 1 week. Small intestine tissues were collected and 
intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were measured; we also 
investigated gut permeability and intestinal transit. Control mice fed ATIs for 
1 week were gavaged daily with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low 
ATI-degrading capacity. Nonobese diabetic/DQ8 mice were sensitized to gluten and 
fed an ATI diet, a gluten-containing diet or a diet with ATIs and gluten for 2 
weeks. Mice were also treated with Lactobacillus strains that had high or low 
ATI-degrading capacity. Intestinal tissues were collected and IELs, gene 
expression, gut permeability and intestinal microbiota profiles were measured.
RESULTS: In intestinal tissues from control mice, ATIs induced an innate immune 
response by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling to MD2 and CD14, and 
caused barrier dysfunction in the absence of mucosal damage. Administration of 
ATIs to gluten-sensitized mice expressing HLA-DQ8 increased intestinal 
inflammation in response to gluten in the diet. We found ATIs to be degraded by 
Lactobacillus, which reduced the inflammatory effects of ATIs.
CONCLUSIONS: ATIs mediate wheat-induced intestinal dysfunction in wild-type mice 
and exacerbate inflammation to gluten in susceptible mice. Microbiome-modulating 
strategies, such as administration of bacteria with ATI-degrading capacity, may 
be effective in patients with wheat-sensitive disorders.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between allergy and celiac disease (CD) is not 
clear.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to investigate the association of CD 
and CD antibody positivity with hay fever, asthma and immunoglobulin (Ig)E 
sensitization in a general adult population.
METHODS: A total of 2297 individuals were screened for CD antibodies and 
underwent allergy testing. CD antibody-positive participants were invited to 
undergo clinical evaluation including biopsies. Additionally, biobank blood 
samples from four population-based studies (6423, 973, 1718 and 1101 
participants) with data on IgE sensitization to inhalant allergens were screened 
for CD antibodies. CD antibody-positive participants were screened for serum IgE 
against food allergens in three biobank studies. CD-antibody positivity was 
defined as IgA or IgG tissue transglutaminase ≥7 U/ml and/or IgG deamidated 
gliadin peptide ≥10 U/ml.
RESULTS: The nine participants (0.4%) diagnosed with CD had significantly higher 
prevalence of IgE sensitization to wheat and dust mites. The prevalence of CD 
antibody positivity was 0.8% (18/2297), and these participants had a 
significantly higher prevalence of IgE sensitization to food allergens (Fx5), 
egg, dust mites and mugwort. In the biobank studies, the prevalence of CD 
antibody positivity was 0.8% to 1.2%. One study showed a positive association 
between CD antibody positivity and IgE sensitization for dog, horse and food 
allergens.
CONCLUSION: We found a possible association of CD and IgE sensitization to some 
food and inhalant allergens in the Health2006 study. In further studies, 
however, we could not consistently replicate these associations.

Both diabetes and angiotensin II (Ang II) excess trigger cardiac remodeling and 
dysfunction, and diabetic cardiomyopathy. We hypothesized that cardiac 
hypertrophy associated with the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy is 
worsened by increased Ang II. Male type 1 diabetic OVE26 and wild-type mice were 
given Ang II (sc., 1.15 mg/kg, twice a day) for 14 days. Diabetes-induced 
cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy was exacerbated by Ang II treatment as 
determined by echocardiography, wheat germ agglutinin staining and atrial 
natriuretic peptide. Ang II treatment dramatically exacerbated diabetes-caused 
decreased LC3-II, a marker of autophagy, and increased p62, an indicator of 
cytosolic protein clearance. Ang II treatment also augmented diabetes-associated 
increased phosphorylated levels of c-Jun, JNK, mTOR, and miR-221, and decreased 
of p27 expression, a direct target of miR-221. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
assay showed that Ang II elevated c-Jun binding to the promoter of miR-221 in 
diabetic mice. These results suggest that Ang II accelerates cardiac hypertrophy 
in the early stage of murine diabetes, probably through activation of the 
JKN/c-Jun/miR-221 axis and inhibition of downstream autophagy. Therefore, 
inhibition of Ang II or miR-221 in diabetic individuals may be a potential 
approach for delaying the onset and/or reducing the severity of diabetic 
cardiomyopathy.

AIM: To investigate whether coeliac disease (CD) was associated with 
periodontitis among a nationally representative sample of US adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) 2009-2012 enrolled 6,661 subjects with full-mouth periodontal 
examination and serological testing for antitissue transglutaminase (tTg) and 
antiendomysial (EMA) antibodies. CD was defined as (i) self-reported physician 
diagnosis while on a gluten-free diet; or (ii) tTg levels >10.0 U/ml and 
positive EMA results. Positive serology without self-reported diagnosis was 
defined as undiagnosed CD (UdxCD). Periodontitis was defined according to the 
CDC/AAP definition. Multivariable linear and logistic models were used to 
regress the mean probing depth (PD) or attachment loss (AL) outcomes across CD 
categories (none, diagnosed and undiagnosed).
RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate/severe periodontitis and 
diagnosed/undiagnosed CD was 40% and 0.74%, respectively. Mean AL was lower 
among those with CD although results were not statistically significant 
(p = .67). The odds of periodontitis among individuals with diagnosed and 
undiagnosed CD were: 0.5(0.22, 1.16) and 0.62(0.1, 3.75), respectively. Mean PD 
levels among those without CD or with diagnosed or undiagnosed CD were 
1.49 ± 0.02, 1.36 ± 0.11 and 1.31 ± 0.11 (p = .03).
CONCLUSION: CD is associated with modestly lower levels of mean PD but was not 
associated with mean AL or periodontitis. Larger studies are necessary to 
enhance precision and strengthen conclusions.

AIM: Our study examined the growth and nutritional intake of children on milk 
and/or wheat, barley or rye elimination diets.
METHODS: This was a nested case-control study within the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes 
Prediction and Prevention Study. It investigated 295 children born in the 
Tampere University Hospital area between 1997 and 2004 on a diet without cows' 
milk and/or wheat, barley or rye due to food allergies and 265 matched controls. 
Nutritional intake was recorded with three-day food records at the ages of one, 
two and three years. Serial growth measurements were recorded annually up to the 
age of five years.
RESULTS: Despite consuming a balanced diet with sufficient energy and protein, 
the children on milk elimination diets grew slower than the control children (p 
= 0.009). Wheat, barley or rye elimination was not associated with growth. The 
intakes of protein and calcium were lower in children in the milk elimination 
group than the controls, at p < 0.05 for all. However, children on elimination 
diets consumed less saturated fats and sugar and more vitamin C and iron than 
the control children.
CONCLUSION: Children on elimination diets faced an increased risk of growth 
deceleration and suboptimal intake of several micronutrients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association between prevalence of celiac disease and 
geographic region is incompletely understood, but the occurrence of several 
autoimmune disorders has been found to vary along a North-South gradient. We 
examined geographic, demographic, and clinical factors associated with 
prevalence of celiac disease and gluten-free diet in the United States.
METHODS: In a population-based study, we analyzed data on gluten-related 
conditions from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from 2009 
through 2014, on 22,277 participants 6 years and older. We identified persons 
with celiac disease based on results of serum tests for IgA against tissue 
transglutaminase and endomysium or on both a health care provider diagnosis and 
adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten avoidance without celiac disease was 
defined as adherence to a gluten-free diet without a diagnosis of celiac 
disease. We compared mean serum levels of biochemical and nutritional markers 
based on status of gluten-related conditions.
RESULTS: We found 0.7% of participants to have celiac disease and 1.1% of 
participants to avoid gluten without celiac disease. Celiac disease was more 
common among individuals who lived at latitudes of 35°-39° North (odds ratio, 
3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-7.1) or at latitudes of 40° North or more 
(odds ratio, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.6-11.3) than individuals who lived at latitudes 
below 35° North, independent of race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and 
body mass index. Gluten avoidance without celiac disease was more common among 
individuals who lived at latitudes of 40° North or more, independent of 
demographic factors and body mass index. Participants with undiagnosed celiac 
disease (identified by positive results from serologic tests) had lower mean 
levels of vitamin B-12 and folate (data collected from 2009 through 2012) than 
persons without celiac disease. Participants with a health care provider 
diagnosis of celiac disease had a lower mean level of hemoglobin than persons 
without celiac disease. Mean levels of albumin, calcium, iron, ferritin, 
cholesterol, vitamin B-6, and vitamin D (data collected from 2009 through 2010) 
did not differ between participants with gluten-related conditions and those 
without.
CONCLUSIONS: In the US population, a higher proportion of persons living at 
latitudes of 35° North or greater have celiac disease or avoid gluten than 
persons living south of this latitude, independent of race or ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status, or body mass index. Mean levels of vitamin B-12 and folate 
are lower in individuals with undiagnosed celiac disease, and levels of 
hemoglobin are lower in participants with a diagnosis of celiac disease, 
compared with individuals without celiac disease.

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), sometimes known as non-celiac wheat 
sensitivity (NCWS), has recently received much attention, both scientific as 
well as from the alternative medical community. Over the past 5 years, there are 
over 200 publications on NCGS indexed on the PubMed database, the gluten-free 
market has been growing bigger, and it is clear that the number of consumers who 
are on a gluten-free diet (GFD) possibly because of a suspicion for NCGS appears 
to grow even faster. Nevertheless, despite these three rising events, many 
questions about NCGS remain unresolved. It is likely that NCGS represents a 
heterogeneous group of disorders linked by a common response to a GFD. It is 
still not fully understood how gluten, and likely other wheat proteins and 
components, could activate and drive the pathophysiology of NCGS. As a result, 
there are still no clear biomarkers, no robust clinical diagnostic criteria, nor 
a conclusive definition for NCGS. This heterogeneity can be approached by 
reducing the variables, in particular those of human behaviour and placebo 
effect, by studying animal models to address specific biological effects of 
wheat and/or gluten-related proteins. Herein we review the animal models and 
their potential to be used to advance our understanding of these disorders and 
potentially address their prevention and treatment.

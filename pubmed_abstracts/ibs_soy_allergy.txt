BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Gastrointestinal adverse reaction to food (GARF) is 
reported frequently in the general population and even more in patients with 
disorders of the gut brain axis. However, there is a significant difference 
between self-reported and objective proven GARF. The aim of the study was to 
characterize a mucosal correlate of GARF by endoscopic confocal laser 
endomicroscopy (eCLE) with duodenal food challenge (DFC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an observational and proof of concept study we 
evaluated 71 patients with disorders of the gut brain axis without (group I, 
n=19) and with (group II, n=52) GARF by eCLE and DFC. Spontaneous and food 
induced transfer of fluorescein into duodenal lumen was detected 10 minutes 
following intravenously application of fluorescein and 10 minutes after DFC.
RESULTS: According to Rom IV, the patients (group I/II) could be classified as 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 32%/31%, functional abdominal pain without 
changes in bowel movement 47 %/48 %, functional abdominal bloating/distension 0 
%/10 %, functional diarrhea 5 %/ 2 %, and unspecified functional bowel disorder 
16 %/10 %, respectively. 21 %/27 % of the patients responded with a fluorescein 
leakage into the duodenal lumen before and 74 %/69 % following to DFC. Frequency 
rank order of food components that induced a response were soy (55.5 %/60 %), 
wheat (60 %/45.5 %), egg (35.7 %/8.3), milk (30 %/18.2 %) and yeast (10 %/6.6 
%), respectively. Histology of duodenal biopsies, number, form and distribution 
of intraepithelial lymphocytes and mucosal mast cells as well as mast cell 
function were normal. Overall, 14 %/79 % reported main symptom benefit following 
a food exclusion therapy according to eCLE and DFC that was significant 
different between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that eCLE with DFC is a technique 
to clinically evaluate patients with disorders of the gut brain axis and GARF 
resulting in a high proportion of patients reporting symptom benefit upon food 
exclusion dietary advice focussed on the results of eCLE.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND UND STUDIENZIEL: Gastrointestinale 
Nahrungsunverträglichkeiten (GARF) werden häufig in der Allgemeinbevölkerung und 
insbesondere bei Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse berichtet. 
Allerdings besteht eine große Diskrepanz zwischen der subjektiv empfundenen und 
der objektivierten GARF. Das Studienziel war die Charakterisierung eines 
mukosalen Korrelates durch die duodenale Nahrungsprovokation (DFC) mittels 
endoskopischer konfokaler Laserendomikroskopie (eCLE).
PATIENTEN UND METHODE: In einer Observations- und „proof of concept“-Studie 
wurden 71 Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse ohne (Gruppe I, n=19) und 
mit (Gruppe II, n=52) GARF durch eCLE und DFC untersucht. Hierbei wurden der 
spontane und nahrungsinduzierte Transfer von Fluorescein in das Duodenallumen 10 
Minuten nach intravenöser Gabe untersucht.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Patienten (Gruppe I/II) wurden gemäß Rom IV-Kriterien in 
Reizdarmsyndrom (IBS) 32%/31%, funktionelle Bauchschmerzen ohne 
Stuhlgangverändeurngen 47%/48%, funktionelle Blähungen/Bauchdistension 0%/10%, 
funktionelle Diarrhoe 5%/ 2%, and unspezifische funktionelle Bauchbeschwerden 
16%/10% klassifiziert. 21%/27% der Patienten zeigten einen Transfer von 
Fluorescein in das Duodenallumen vor und 74%/69% nach DFC. Die 
Häufigkeitsrangfolge der Nahrungskomponenten, die eine Reaktion auslösten, waren 
Soja (55,5%/60%), Weizen (60%/45,5%), Ei (35,7%/8,3%), Milch (30%/18,2%) und 
Hefe (10%/6,6%). Sowohl die Histologie der Duodenalbiopsien, die Zahl, Form und 
Verteilung der intraepithelialen Lymphozyten und Mastzellen als auch die 
Funktion der Mastzellen waren unauffällig. Insgesamt berichteten 14%/79% über 
eine Symptomenbesserung durch eine diätetische Ausschlusstherapie gemäß den 
Ergebnissen der DFC, die zwischen den beiden Gruppen nicht signifikant 
unterschiedlich war.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigen, dass eCLE mit DFC eine 
Technik zur Untersuchung von Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse und 
GARF ist. Hierdurch kann eine große Gruppe von Patienten charakterisiert werden, 
die von einer diätetischen Auschlusstherapie gemäß den Ergebnissen der eCLE 
profitieren.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Food hypersensitivity (FH), irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD) have many overlapping symptoms, including 
abdominal discomfort, bloating, and altered bowel habits. We aimed to determine 
the frequency of FH in patients with IBS and functional FD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients of either gender diagnosed with IBS and/or 
FD as per the Rome III criteria were recruited. Patients underwent serological 
testing against 6 food allergens: beef, shrimp, egg white, milk, peanut, and 
soy-bean. Those testing positive were subjected to a food elimination diet for 4 
weeks. Those showing improvement on elimination diet were subjected to 
re-challenge. Changes in symptoms were documented by the Global overall 
improvement scale (GOS) and Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS).
RESULTS: Two hundred patients were screened. Average age of the patients was 
38.6, and 55 % were male. Nineteen (38%) patients tested positive, and were 
subjected to a food elimination diet. The most common food hypersensitivity was 
shrimp (17/89%), followed by 4/21% for egg-white, and peanut. Off these, 8 
showed improvement. They were re-challenged, and were evaluated 2 weeks later, 
when all suffered symptom relapse. These 8 (4%) patients were diagnosed with FH. 
There was a statistically significant difference in both GSRS (total and 
component) and GOS scores at baseline between patients testing (+) and (-) on 
food allergen testing, mainly for diarrhoea (p=0.001), abdominal pain (p=0.001) 
and indigestion p=<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: FH is present in 4 % of patients with a functional gastrointestinal 
disorder.

BACKGROUND: Although never evaluated for efficacy, n-3 (ω-3) long-chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) are commercially offered as treatment for 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate, in a mast cell-dependent 
model for visceral hypersensitivity, whether this pathophysiologic mechanism can 
be reversed by dietary LCPUFA treatment via peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor γ (PPARG) activation.
METHODS: Maternally separated rats were subjected to hypersensitivity-inducing 
acute stress at adult age. Reversal was attempted by protocols with tuna 
oil-supplemented diets [4% soy oil (SO) and 3% tuna oil (SO-T3) or 3% SO and 7% 
tuna oil (SO-T7)] and compared with control SO diets (7% or 10% SO) 4 wk after 
stress. The PPARG agonist rosiglitazone was evaluated in a 1 wk preventive 
protocol (30 mg · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹). Erythrocytes were assessed to confirm LCPUFA 
uptake and tissue expression of lipoprotein lipase and glycerol kinase as 
indicators of PPARG activation. Colonic mast cell degranulation was evaluated by 
toluidine blue staining. In vitro, human mast cell line 1 (HMC-1) cells were 
pretreated with rosiglitazone, eicosapentaenoic acid, or docosahexaenoic acid, 
stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium ionophore or 
compound 48/80 and evaluated for tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and 
β-hexosaminidase release.
RESULTS: Stress led to visceral hypersensitivity in all groups. Hypersensitivity 
was not reversed by SO-T3 or control treatment [prestress vs. 24 h poststress 
vs. posttreatment area under the curve; 76 ± 4 vs. 128 ± 12 (P < 0.05) vs. 115 ± 
14 and 82 ± 5 vs. 127 ± 16 (P < 0.01) vs. 113 ± 19, respectively]. Comparison of 
SO-T7 with its control showed similar results [74 ± 6 vs. 103 ± 13 (P < 0.05) 
vs. 115 ± 17 and 66 ± 3 vs. 103 ± 10 (P < 0.05) vs. 117 ± 11, respectively]. 
Erythrocytes showed significant LCPUFA uptake in the absence of colonic PPARG 
activation. Rosiglitazone induced increased PPARG target gene expression, but 
did not prevent hypersensitivity. Mast cell degranulation never differed between 
groups. Rosiglitazone and LCPUFAs significantly reduced PMA/calcium 
ionophore-induced TNF-α release but not degranulation of HMC-1 cells.
CONCLUSION: Dietary LCPUFAs did not reverse stress-induced visceral 
hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats. Although further research is 
needed, claims concerning LCPUFAs as a treatment option in IBS cannot be 
confirmed at this point and should be regarded with caution.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) often associated with 
psychological distress, is characterized by increased gut permeability and 
visceral sensitivity. In animals, stress increases intestinal paracellular 
permeability (IPP), visceral sensitivity and colonic proteolytic activity. 
Estradiol reduces IPP and affects visceral sensitivity in non-stressed 
ovariectomized rats, but whether estrogens affect stress-induced 
hyperpermeability and hypersensitivity in cyclic females remains unclear. We 
aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of a phytoestrogen-rich soy germ fermented 
ingredient (SG) on visceral hypersensitivity, hyperpermeability and other 
symptoms in stressed intact female rats, (ii) the mechanisms of action involved 
on the basis of both estrogenic and protease inhibitor activities of SG.
METHODS: Female rats received orally for 15-d either SG, 17β-estradiol benzoate 
(EB), or vehicles, with or without the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist 
ICI182.780 before stress. Visceral sensitivity, IPP, faecal proteolytic 
activity, plasma corticosterone, rat mast cell protease II immunostaining, and 
occludin expression were assessed.
RESULTS: Stress increased IPP (concomitantly to a drop in occludin expression), 
visceral sensitivity, faecal proteolytic activity and plasma corticosterone. 
Similarly to EB, SG prevented the stress-induced hyperpermeability, and 
hypersensitivity, without changes in plasma corticosterone. SG inhibited the 
increase in faecal proteolytic activity, enhanced occludin expression, and 
reduced the colonic mast cell density. All SG effects, except decrease on faecal 
proteolytic activity, were blocked by ICI182.780.
CONCLUSION: A 2-wk oral treatment with SG prevented the stress-induced 
hyperpermeability and visceral hypersensitivity in cyclic rats through ER 
activation, and blocked the increase in colonic proteolytic activity, suggesting 
that SG can be promising in IBS management.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: A percentage of patients with symptoms of irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS) suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH) and improve on a 
food-elimination diet. No assays have satisfactory levels of sensitivity for 
identifying patients with FH. We evaluated the efficacy of an in vitro basophil 
activation assay in the diagnosis of FH in IBS-like patients.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 consecutive patients diagnosed 
with IBS according to Rome II criteria. We analyzed in vitro activation of 
basophils by food allergens (based on levels of CD63 expression), as well as 
total and food-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels in serum. Effects of 
elimination diets and double-blind food challenges were used as standards for FH 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: Twenty-four of the patients (20%) had FH (cow's milk and/or wheat 
hypersensitivity); their symptom scores improved significantly when they were 
placed on an elimination diet. Patients with FH differed from other IBS patients 
in that they had a longer duration of clinical history, a history of FH as 
children, and an increased frequency of self-reported FH; they also had 
hypersensitivities to other antigens (eg, egg or soy). The basophil activation 
assay diagnosed FH with 86% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 87% accuracy; this 
level of sensitivity was significantly higher than that of serum total IgE or 
food-specific IgE assays.
CONCLUSIONS: A cytometric assay that quantifies basophils after stimulation with 
food antigens based on cell-surface expression of CD63 had high levels of 
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing FH. This assay might be 
used to diagnose FH in patients with IBS-like symptoms.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the outpatient with chronic inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) is a difficult but important challenge to recognize and treat. It 
is very helpful to have effective treatment approaches for IBS that are 
practical and use minimal medications. Because of the underlying chronic 
inflammation in IBD, IBS symptoms occur with increased frequency and severity, 
secondary to increased hypersensitivity to foods and beverages that stimulate 
the gastrointestinal tract. This paper discusses how to treat IBS in the IBD 
outpatient, with emphasis on using a food and beverage intolerance, avoidance 
diet. The adverse effects of many foods and beverages are amount dependent and 
can be delayed, additive, and cumulative. The specific types of foods and 
beverages that can induce IBS symptoms include milk and milk containing 
products; caffeine containing products; alcoholic beverages; fruits; fruit 
juices; spices; seasonings; diet beverages; diet foods; diet candies; diet gum; 
fast foods; condiments; fried foods; fatty foods; multigrain breads; sourdough 
breads; bagels; salads; salad dressings; vegetables; beans; red meats; gravies; 
spaghetti sauce; stews; nuts; popcorn; high fiber; and cookies, crackers, 
pretzels, cakes, and pies. The types of foods and beverages that are better 
tolerated include water; rice; plain pasta or noodles; baked or broiled 
potatoes; white breads; plain fish, chicken, turkey, or ham; eggs; dry cereals; 
soy or rice based products; peas; applesauce; cantaloupe; watermelon; fruit 
cocktail; margarine; jams; jellies; and peanut butter. Handouts that were 
developed based upon what worsens or helps IBS symptoms in patients are included 
to help patients learn which foods and beverages to avoid and which are better 
tolerated.

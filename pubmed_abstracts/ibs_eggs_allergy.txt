Background/Objectives: Food hypersensitivity remains an understudied and 
overlooked subject globally. It is characterized by adverse reactions to dietary 
substances, potentially triggered by various mechanisms. Food allergy, a subset 
of food hypersensitivity, denotes an immune response to food proteins 
categorized into immunoglobulin IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated reactions. 
Conversely, food intolerance, another facet of food hypersensitivity, refers to 
non-immunological reactions, in which the human body cannot properly digest 
certain foods or components, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort and other 
non-immune-related symptoms. The main objective of this study was to determine 
and differentiate the differences, characteristics, and types of food 
hypersensitivity. Methods: This study involved a comprehensive review of key 
research from 1990 onward, including review articles, prospective studies, 
nested case-control studies, and meta-analyses. Results: Recognizing these 
differences is essential for healthcare professionals to ensure accurate 
diagnosis, effective management, and improved patient outcomes, while also 
aiding dietitians in providing optimal nutritional and dietary guidance. 
Conclusions: there are big differences between the main characteristics, such as 
symptoms, complications, and treatments between allergies, and food 
intolerances. Commonly reported trigger foods include cow milk, gluten, eggs, 
nuts, and seafood.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Gastrointestinal adverse reaction to food (GARF) is 
reported frequently in the general population and even more in patients with 
disorders of the gut brain axis. However, there is a significant difference 
between self-reported and objective proven GARF. The aim of the study was to 
characterize a mucosal correlate of GARF by endoscopic confocal laser 
endomicroscopy (eCLE) with duodenal food challenge (DFC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an observational and proof of concept study we 
evaluated 71 patients with disorders of the gut brain axis without (group I, 
n=19) and with (group II, n=52) GARF by eCLE and DFC. Spontaneous and food 
induced transfer of fluorescein into duodenal lumen was detected 10 minutes 
following intravenously application of fluorescein and 10 minutes after DFC.
RESULTS: According to Rom IV, the patients (group I/II) could be classified as 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 32%/31%, functional abdominal pain without 
changes in bowel movement 47 %/48 %, functional abdominal bloating/distension 0 
%/10 %, functional diarrhea 5 %/ 2 %, and unspecified functional bowel disorder 
16 %/10 %, respectively. 21 %/27 % of the patients responded with a fluorescein 
leakage into the duodenal lumen before and 74 %/69 % following to DFC. Frequency 
rank order of food components that induced a response were soy (55.5 %/60 %), 
wheat (60 %/45.5 %), egg (35.7 %/8.3), milk (30 %/18.2 %) and yeast (10 %/6.6 
%), respectively. Histology of duodenal biopsies, number, form and distribution 
of intraepithelial lymphocytes and mucosal mast cells as well as mast cell 
function were normal. Overall, 14 %/79 % reported main symptom benefit following 
a food exclusion therapy according to eCLE and DFC that was significant 
different between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that eCLE with DFC is a technique 
to clinically evaluate patients with disorders of the gut brain axis and GARF 
resulting in a high proportion of patients reporting symptom benefit upon food 
exclusion dietary advice focussed on the results of eCLE.

Publisher: HINTERGRUND UND STUDIENZIEL: Gastrointestinale 
Nahrungsunverträglichkeiten (GARF) werden häufig in der Allgemeinbevölkerung und 
insbesondere bei Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse berichtet. 
Allerdings besteht eine große Diskrepanz zwischen der subjektiv empfundenen und 
der objektivierten GARF. Das Studienziel war die Charakterisierung eines 
mukosalen Korrelates durch die duodenale Nahrungsprovokation (DFC) mittels 
endoskopischer konfokaler Laserendomikroskopie (eCLE).
PATIENTEN UND METHODE: In einer Observations- und „proof of concept“-Studie 
wurden 71 Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse ohne (Gruppe I, n=19) und 
mit (Gruppe II, n=52) GARF durch eCLE und DFC untersucht. Hierbei wurden der 
spontane und nahrungsinduzierte Transfer von Fluorescein in das Duodenallumen 10 
Minuten nach intravenöser Gabe untersucht.
ERGEBNISSE: Die Patienten (Gruppe I/II) wurden gemäß Rom IV-Kriterien in 
Reizdarmsyndrom (IBS) 32%/31%, funktionelle Bauchschmerzen ohne 
Stuhlgangverändeurngen 47%/48%, funktionelle Blähungen/Bauchdistension 0%/10%, 
funktionelle Diarrhoe 5%/ 2%, and unspezifische funktionelle Bauchbeschwerden 
16%/10% klassifiziert. 21%/27% der Patienten zeigten einen Transfer von 
Fluorescein in das Duodenallumen vor und 74%/69% nach DFC. Die 
Häufigkeitsrangfolge der Nahrungskomponenten, die eine Reaktion auslösten, waren 
Soja (55,5%/60%), Weizen (60%/45,5%), Ei (35,7%/8,3%), Milch (30%/18,2%) und 
Hefe (10%/6,6%). Sowohl die Histologie der Duodenalbiopsien, die Zahl, Form und 
Verteilung der intraepithelialen Lymphozyten und Mastzellen als auch die 
Funktion der Mastzellen waren unauffällig. Insgesamt berichteten 14%/79% über 
eine Symptomenbesserung durch eine diätetische Ausschlusstherapie gemäß den 
Ergebnissen der DFC, die zwischen den beiden Gruppen nicht signifikant 
unterschiedlich war.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Die Ergebnisse der Studie zeigen, dass eCLE mit DFC eine 
Technik zur Untersuchung von Patienten mit Störungen der Darm Hirn Achse und 
GARF ist. Hierdurch kann eine große Gruppe von Patienten charakterisiert werden, 
die von einer diätetischen Auschlusstherapie gemäß den Ergebnissen der eCLE 
profitieren.

Altered gut regulation, including motor and secretory mechanisms, is 
characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The severity of postprandial 
symptoms in IBS patients is associated with discomfort and pain; gas-related 
symptoms such as bloating and abdominal distension; and abnormal colonic 
motility. The aim of this study was to assess the postprandial response, i.e., 
gut peptide secretion and gastric myoelectric activity, in patients with 
constipation-predominant IBS. The study was conducted on 42 IBS patients (14 
males, 28 females, mean age 45.1 ± 15.3 years) and 42 healthy participants (16 
males, 26 females, mean age 41.1 ± 8.7 years). The study assessed plasma gut 
peptide levels (gastrin, CCK-Cholecystokinin, VIP-Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide, 
ghrelin, insulin) and gastric myoelectric activity obtained from 
electrogastrography (EGG) in the preprandial and postprandial period (meal-oral 
nutritional supplement 300 kcal/300 ml). Mean preprandial gastrin and insulin 
levels were significantly elevated in IBS patients compared to the control group 
(gastrin: 72.27 ± 26.89 vs. 12.27 ± 4.91 pg/ml; p < 0.00001 and insulin: 
15.31 ± 12.92 vs. 8.04 ± 3.21 IU/ml; p = 0.0001), while VIP and ghrelin levels 
were decreased in IBS patients (VIP: 6.69 ± 4.68 vs. 27.26 ± 21.51 ng/ml; 
p = 0.0001 and ghrelin: 176.01 ± 88.47 vs. 250.24 ± 84.55 pg/ml; p < 0.0001). A 
nonsignificant change in the CCK level was observed. IBS patients showed 
significant changes in postprandial hormone levels compared to the preprandial 
state-specifically, there were increases in gastrin (p = 0.000), CCK 
(p < 0.0001), VIP (p < 0.0001), ghrelin (p = 0.000) and insulin (p < 0.0001). 
Patients with IBS showed reduced preprandial and postprandial normogastria 
(59.8 ± 22.0 vs. 66.3 ± 20.2%) compared to control values (83.19 ± 16.7%; 
p < 0.0001 vs. 86.1 ± 9.4%; p < 0.0001). In response to the meal, we did not 
observe an increase in the percentage of normogastria or the average percentage 
slow-wave coupling (APSWC) in IBS patients. The postprandial to preprandial 
power ratio (PR) indicates alterations in gastric contractions; in controls, 
PR = 2.7, whereas in IBS patients, PR = 1.7, which was significantly lower 
(p = 0.00009). This ratio reflects a decrease in gastric contractility. 
Disturbances in the postprandial concentration of gut peptides (gastrin, insulin 
and ghrelin) in plasma may contribute to abnormal gastric function and 
consequently intestinal motility, which are manifested in the intensification of 
clinical symptoms, such as visceral hypersensitivity or irregular bowel 
movements in IBS patients.

BACKGROUND: Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) in adults is 
being increasingly recognized; however, little is known about its 
characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and associated 
factors in adult FPIES.
METHODS: A 10-year prospective study was conducted in the Allergy Section of 
Alicante General Hospital in adults diagnosed with FPIES. Detailed interviews 
with patients and oral food challenges (OFCs) were performed to confirm 
diagnosis or evaluate for tolerance. Comorbidities and possible risk factors 
were analyzed retrospectively through electronic medical records to assess their 
association with the disease.
RESULTS: One hundred and seven adults with FPIES (93.5% female) were followed 
for a median of 6.2 years. Abdominal pain was the most common manifestation 
(96.3%), followed by diarrhea (72%) and vomiting (60.7%). Seafood (59.8%), egg 
(14%), and milk (10.3%) were the most common triggers, whereas 43.9% reacted to 
more than 1 food group. We performed 49 OFCs: 9 to confirm diagnosis and 40 to 
evaluate for tolerance. After a median 3.5 years, 16.8% achieved tolerance. 
Resolution was correlated inversely with duration of the disease (P = .04) and 
seafood (P = .023) but not with age of onset. The prevalence of gastrointestinal 
pathologies such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), eosinophilic esophagitis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease was higher than in the general 
population. A higher number of FPIES triggers were correlated with also having a 
diagnosis of IBS (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Although adult FPIES normally persists, some patients achieve 
tolerance. Adults with FPIES have a relatively high prevalence of 
gastrointestinal pathologies. The predominance of women may be related to 
hormonal factors. The clinical differences with pediatric FPIES warrant a 
revision of diagnostic criteria in adults.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a technique that 
permits real-time detection and quantification of changes in intestinal tissues 
and cells, including increases in intraepithelial lymphocytes and fluid 
extravasation through epithelial leaks. Using CLE analysis of patients with 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), we found that more than half have responses to 
specific food components. Exclusion of the defined food led to long-term symptom 
relief. We used the results of CLE to detect reactions to food in a larger 
patient population and analyzed duodenal biopsy samples and fluid from patients 
to investigate mechanisms of these reactions.
METHODS: In a prospective study, 155 patients with IBS received 4 challenges 
with each of 4 common food components via the endoscope, followed by CLE, at a 
tertiary medical center. Classical food allergies were excluded by negative 
results from immunoglobulin E serology analysis and skin tests for common food 
antigens. Duodenal biopsy samples and fluid were collected 2 weeks before and 
immediately after CLE and were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblots. Results from 
patients who had a response to food during CLE (CLE+) were compared with results 
from patients who did not have a reaction during CLE (CLE-) or healthy 
individuals (controls).
RESULTS: Of the 108 patients who completed the study, 76 were CLE+ (70%), and 46 
of these (61%) reacted to wheat. CLE+ patients had a 4-fold increase in 
prevalence of atopic disorders compared with controls (P = .001). Numbers of 
intraepithelial lymphocytes were significantly higher in duodenal biopsy samples 
from CLE+ vs CLE- patients or controls (P = .001). Expression of claudin-2 
increased from crypt to villus tip (P < .001) and was up-regulated in CLE+ 
patients compared with CLE- patients or controls (P = .023). Levels of occludin 
were lower in duodenal biopsy samples from CLE+ patients vs controls (P = .022) 
and were lowest in villus tips (P < .001). Levels of messenger RNAs encoding 
inflammatory cytokines were unchanged in duodenal tissues after CLE challenge, 
but eosinophil degranulation increased, and levels of eosinophilic cationic 
protein were higher in duodenal fluid from CLE+ patients than controls (P = 
.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In a CLE analysis of patients with IBS, we found that more than 50% 
of patients could have nonclassical food allergy, with immediate disruption of 
the intestinal barrier upon exposure to food antigens. Duodenal tissues from 
patients with responses to food components during CLE had immediate increases 
in expression of claudin-2 and decreases in occludin. CLE+ patients also had 
increased eosinophil degranulation, indicating an atypical food allergy 
characterized by eosinophil activation.

Hospital, Pakistan.

BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Food hypersensitivity (FH), irritable bowel syndrome 
(IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD) have many overlapping symptoms, including 
abdominal discomfort, bloating, and altered bowel habits. We aimed to determine 
the frequency of FH in patients with IBS and functional FD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients of either gender diagnosed with IBS and/or 
FD as per the Rome III criteria were recruited. Patients underwent serological 
testing against 6 food allergens: beef, shrimp, egg white, milk, peanut, and 
soy-bean. Those testing positive were subjected to a food elimination diet for 4 
weeks. Those showing improvement on elimination diet were subjected to 
re-challenge. Changes in symptoms were documented by the Global overall 
improvement scale (GOS) and Gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS).
RESULTS: Two hundred patients were screened. Average age of the patients was 
38.6, and 55 % were male. Nineteen (38%) patients tested positive, and were 
subjected to a food elimination diet. The most common food hypersensitivity was 
shrimp (17/89%), followed by 4/21% for egg-white, and peanut. Off these, 8 
showed improvement. They were re-challenged, and were evaluated 2 weeks later, 
when all suffered symptom relapse. These 8 (4%) patients were diagnosed with FH. 
There was a statistically significant difference in both GSRS (total and 
component) and GOS scores at baseline between patients testing (+) and (-) on 
food allergen testing, mainly for diarrhoea (p=0.001), abdominal pain (p=0.001) 
and indigestion p=<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: FH is present in 4 % of patients with a functional gastrointestinal 
disorder.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) often relate their 
symptoms to the intake of food and modify their diet. IgE-mediated food allergy 
is uncommon in IBS, but the role of IgG-mediated food hypersensitivity remains 
inconclusive. The primary aim of this study was to compare food- and 
yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies in subjects with and without IBS.
METHODS: This was a case control study in the general population for which 
subjects completed questionnaires about abdominal complaints and their intake of 
common food items. Blood samples were collected, and food- and yeast-specific 
IgG and IgG4 antibodies were measured. Antibodies were measured in mg/L.
RESULTS: We included 269 subjects with IBS and 277 control subjects. After 
correction for subject characteristics and diet, there were no significant 
differences with regard to food- and yeast-specific IgG and IgG4 antibodies 
between subjects with IBS and controls. Lower values of IgG antibodies against 
egg (OR 0.99 (0.98 to 1.00), p = 0.002) and beef (OR 0.75 (0.60 to 0.94), 
p = 0.012) and higher values of IgG antibodies against chicken (OR 1.14 (1.03 to 
1.27), p = 0.009) were associated with more severe symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that IgG-and IgG4-mediated food and yeast 
hypersensitivity in IBS is unlikely. IgG antibodies against food and yeast may 
reflect the diet.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like 
symptoms suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH); their symptoms improve when 
they are placed on elimination diets. No assays identify patients with FH with 
satisfactory levels of sensitivity. We determined the frequency of FH among 
patients with symptoms of IBS and the ability of fecal assays for tryptase, 
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), or calprotectin to diagnose FH.
METHODS: The study included 160 patients with IBS, 40 patients with other 
gastrointestinal diseases, and 50 healthy individuals (controls). At the start 
of the study, patients completed a symptom severity questionnaire, fecal samples 
were assayed, and levels of specific immunoglobulin E were measured. Patients 
were observed for 4 weeks, placed on an elimination diet (without cow's milk and 
derivatives, wheat, egg, tomato, and chocolate) for 4 weeks, and kept a diet 
diary. Those who reported improvements after the elimination diet period were 
then diagnosed with FH, based on the results of a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, oral food challenge (with cow's milk proteins and then with 
wheat proteins).
RESULTS: Forty of the patients with IBS (25%) were found to have FH. Levels of 
fecal ECP and tryptase were significantly higher among patients with IBS and FH 
than those without FH. The ECP assay was the most accurate assay for diagnosis 
of FH, showing 65% sensitivity and 91% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-five percent of patients with IBS have FH. These patients 
had increased levels of fecal ECP and tryptase, indicating that they might cause 
inflammation in patients with IBS. Fecal assays for ECP could be used to 
identify FH in patients with IBS.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and expression of corticotropin 
releasing factor (CRF) in spinal cord, hypothalamus and third ventricle of 
cerebrum, of the hypersensitive viscera rats, and to research on the mechanism 
of CRF in the hypersensitive vicera signal conduction pathway in IBS (irritable 
bowel syndrome) and to investigate possible active mechanisms of tongxie 
prescription on IBS.
METHOD: Forty SD rats were divided randomly into three groups. The rats of model 
No. 1 were sensitized by injecting egg albumin into abdominal cavity. The rats 
of model No. 2 were sensitised by conditional stimulus and unconditional 
stimulus. The two model groups were both divided randomly into two groups. The 
five groups were given intragastric administration with Tongxie prescription or 
normal saline for four weeks. Then quantitative analysis of CRF in the 
lumbosacral spinal cord and brain of rats were achieved by immunohistochemical 
method and computerized image system.
RESULT: The sensitivity of the groups being treated with tongxie prescription 
were much lower than the model groups (P < 0.01). The immunohistochemical method 
showed that CRF was expressed in the lumbar intumescentia of spinal cord, 
hypothalamus and the diaphragmatic surface of third ventricle of cerebrum. The 
CRF positive index of the model groups was higher than that of the blank group 
(P < 0.01). The CRF positive index of the healing groups was lower than that of 
the model groups (P < 0.01). The CRF positive index of the healing groups was 
higher than that of the blank group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The two model rats evoked by two different stimulation both appeared 
visceral hypersensitivity state. CRF is related to stress. The increase of CRF 
expression in the lumbar intumescentia of spinal cord, hypothalamus and the 
diaphragmatic surface of third ventricle of cerebrum showed that CRF is critical 
to the introduce of stimulus signal of vicera. Tongxie prescription can 
significantly decrease CRF expression. This is one mechanism to decrease 
sensitivity of hypersensitive viscera rats.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: A percentage of patients with symptoms of irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS) suffer from food hypersensitivity (FH) and improve on a 
food-elimination diet. No assays have satisfactory levels of sensitivity for 
identifying patients with FH. We evaluated the efficacy of an in vitro basophil 
activation assay in the diagnosis of FH in IBS-like patients.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 120 consecutive patients diagnosed 
with IBS according to Rome II criteria. We analyzed in vitro activation of 
basophils by food allergens (based on levels of CD63 expression), as well as 
total and food-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E levels in serum. Effects of 
elimination diets and double-blind food challenges were used as standards for FH 
diagnosis.
RESULTS: Twenty-four of the patients (20%) had FH (cow's milk and/or wheat 
hypersensitivity); their symptom scores improved significantly when they were 
placed on an elimination diet. Patients with FH differed from other IBS patients 
in that they had a longer duration of clinical history, a history of FH as 
children, and an increased frequency of self-reported FH; they also had 
hypersensitivities to other antigens (eg, egg or soy). The basophil activation 
assay diagnosed FH with 86% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and 87% accuracy; this 
level of sensitivity was significantly higher than that of serum total IgE or 
food-specific IgE assays.
CONCLUSIONS: A cytometric assay that quantifies basophils after stimulation with 
food antigens based on cell-surface expression of CD63 had high levels of 
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in diagnosing FH. This assay might be 
used to diagnose FH in patients with IBS-like symptoms.

Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection with blood 
flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Widely distributed in the Middle East, 
southeast Asia, Latin America, and (mostly) sub-Saharan Africa, schistosomiasis 
is acquired upon skin penetration of infective larvae released by freshwater 
snails. Acute infection might present with self-limiting hypersensitivity 
reactions (known as Katayama fever). Chronic infection typically leads to two 
main clinical patterns: intestinal or urogenital schistosomiasis, depending on 
the infecting species. Impairment of other body sites (eg, the CNS or 
respiratory tract) can occur. The intestinal form is characterised by abdominal 
pain and diarrhoea, with or without blood; complications are hepatic fibrosis, 
portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and variceal bleeding. The urogenital form is 
characterised by dysuria and haematuria; complications are renal failure and 
squamous-cell carcinoma of the bladder. Conventional diagnosis is based on egg 
detection in faeces or urine, although sensitivity might be low. Praziquantel is 
the first-line treatment, and it is also provided in preventive chemotherapy 
campaigns by mass drug administration to afflicted communities.

BACKGROUND: Katayama syndrome is an acute manifestation of schistosomiasis, a 
parasitic infection that manifests itself through a hypersensitivity reaction to 
migrating larvae and early egg deposition. Left undiagnosed and untreated, acute 
schistosomiasis can develop into chronic schistosomiasis which can lead to 
debilitating morbidity such as pulmonary hypertension. This case highlights that 
Katayama syndrome can also been seen in regions where the parasite is not 
endemic, as it occurs in travelers returning from endemic regions or in 
immigrants.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 26-year-old asthmatic male, who 
presented with systemic symptoms including fever, myalgia, night sweats as well 
as gastro-intestinal and pulmonary complaints since five days. At presentation, 
there was a raised blood eosinophil count and nodular lesions were seen on 
computed tomography. After considering diagnoses such as tuberculosis, 
vasculitis and hypereosinophilic syndrome, it was repeated history taking that 
revealed that the patient had suffered from swimmer's itch during a stay in 
Guinea. A stool sample showed microscopic presence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs, 
confirming the diagnosis of Katayama syndrome. The patient was treated with 
tapered corticosteroids to suppress the hypersensitivity reaction and 
praziquantel was added to cure the parasitic infection. This led to a complete 
resolution of the patients' symptoms and radiological abnormalities. Negative 
stool samples confirmed the eradication of the schistosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Swimmer's itch and Katayama syndrome are manifestations of acute 
schistosomiasis. It is important to recognize the syndrome, because early 
diagnosis and adequate treatment can prevent chronic disease and significant 
morbidity.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can occur as a complication of 
schistosomiasis. In humans, schistosomiasis-PH persists despite antihelminthic 
therapy and parasite eradication. We hypothesized that persistent disease arises 
as a consequence of exposure repetition.
METHODS: Following intraperitoneal sensitization, mice were experimentally 
exposed to Schistosoma eggs by intravenous injection, either once or three times 
repeatedly. The phenotype was characterized by right heart catheterization and 
tissue analysis.
RESULTS: Following intraperitoneal sensitization, a single intravenous 
Schistosoma egg exposure resulted in a PH phenotype that peaked at 7-14 days, 
followed by spontaneous resolution. Three sequential exposures resulted in a 
persistent PH phenotype. Inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different 
between mice exposed to one or three egg doses, but there was an increase in 
perivascular fibrosis in those who received three egg doses. Significant 
perivascular fibrosis was also observed in autopsy specimens from patients who 
died of this condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeatedly exposing mice to schistosomiasis causes a persistent PH 
phenotype, accompanied by perivascular fibrosis. Perivascular fibrosis may 
contribute to the persistent schistosomiasis-PH observed in humans with this 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Severe anaphylactic reactions to home doses may occur during food 
allergy oral immunotherapy (OIT).
OBJECTIVE: To study the rate and risk factors for such reactions.
METHODS: We studied all patients aged greater than 3.5 years who completed OIT 
in a single center between April 2010 and January 2020. All home 
epinephrine-treated reactions (HETRs) were identified. High-grade HETRs 
(HG-HETRs) were defined as HETRs involving respiratory (SpO2 of 94% or less), 
cardiovascular (low blood pressure), or central nervous system impairment (loss 
of consciousness). We investigated the rate and risk factors for HG-HETRs.
RESULTS: A total of 1,637 OIT treatments were studied: milk (880), peanut (346), 
tree nuts (221), sesame (115), and egg (75). Of 390 identified HETRs, 30 
HG-HETRs occurred during 27 treatments (1.65% of all treatments). Nearly all (26 
of 30) were during milk OIT in patients with house dust mite (HDM) sensitization 
and asthma (26 of 30 each). Of the 30 patients with HG-HETRs, 21 recovered with 
one or two epinephrine treatments, but nine (0.55% of all treatments) did not 
respond to a second dose of epinephrine and were deemed to have refractory 
anaphylaxis. Three patients required intensive care unit admission and three 
received epinephrine drip, but none required ventilatory support. Risk factors 
for HG-HETRs included milk OIT (P = .031), asthma (P = .02) and HDM 
sensitization (P = .02). No specific triggers for HG-HETR were identified. Of 
patients with HG-HETRs, 25.9% were fully desensitized, including the four 
non-milk treated patients; 22.2% were partially desensitized; and 51.9% failed.
CONCLUSIONS: High-grade HETRs are uncommon, particularly refractory anaphylactic 
reactions to home OIT doses. Although milk OIT, asthma, and HDM sensitization 
are the main risk factors for such reactions, identification of patients who are 
at risk is challenging.

The parasitic worms, Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum, reside in 
the mesenteric veins, where they release eggs that induce a dramatic 
granulomatous response in the liver and intestines. Subsequently, infection may 
further develop into significant fibrosis and portal hypertension. Over the past 
several years, uncovering the mechanism of immunopathology in schistosomiasis 
has become a major research objective. It is known that T lymphocytes, 
especially CD4+ T cells, are essential for immune responses against Schistosoma 
species. However, obtaining a clear understanding of how T lymphocytes regulate 
the pathological process is proving to be a daunting challenge. To date, CD4+ T 
cell subsets have been classified into several distinct T helper (Th) phenotypes 
including Th1, Th2, Th17, T follicular helper cells (Tfh), Th9, and regulatory T 
cells (Tregs). In the case of schistosomiasis, the granulomatous inflammation 
and the chronic liver pathology are critically regulated by the Th1/Th2 
responses. Animal studies suggest that there is a moderate Th1 response to 
parasite antigens during the acute stage, but then, egg-derived antigens induce 
a sustained and dominant Th2 response that mediates granuloma formation and 
liver fibrosis. In addition, the newly discovered Th17 cells also play a 
critical role in the hepatic immunopathology of schistosomiasis. Within the 
liver, Tregs are recruited to hepatic granulomas and exert an immunosuppressive 
role to limit the granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, recent 
studies have shown that Tfh and Th9 cells might also promote liver granulomas 
and fibrogenesis in the murine schistosomiasis. Thus, during infection, T-cell 
subsets undergo complicated cross-talk with antigen presenting cells that then 
defines their various roles in the local microenvironment for regulating the 
pathological progression of schistosomiasis. This current review summarizes a 
vast body of literature to elucidate the contribution of T lymphocytes and their 
associated cytokines in the immunopathology of schistosomiasis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modalities and timing of the introduction of solid foods to 
infants may influence growth, obesity, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic disease. The most debated effects of solid 
foods introduction are those on the development of food allergy.
RECENT FINDINGS: For the first time, in recent years prospective studies have 
been published about the effects of early vs. delayed introduction of allergenic 
foods into the infants' diet on food allergy. According to these studies, the 
early introduction of peanut may be a powerful protecting factor against peanut 
allergy in some risk categories. This seems not be true for wheat, cow's milk, 
sesame, and whitefish. The effect of early introduction of egg on egg allergy 
are controversial.
SUMMARY: The recent studies have changed the practice recommendations given by 
healthcare providers to families. We review the modifications of the 
recommendations of international societies on the introduction of solid foods, 
both to the general population and to infants at risk for allergy.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenic mechanisms underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 
resulting from schistosomiasis, one of the most common causes of pulmonary 
hypertension worldwide, remain unknown. We hypothesized that transforming growth 
factor-β (TGF-β) signaling as a consequence of Th2 inflammation is critical for 
the pathogenesis of this disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice sensitized and subsequently challenged with 
Schistosoma mansoni eggs developed pulmonary hypertension associated with an 
increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, thickening of the pulmonary 
artery media, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Rho-kinase-dependent 
vasoconstriction accounted for ≈60% of the increase in right ventricular 
systolic pressure. The pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension 
were dependent on increased TGF-β signaling, as pharmacological blockade of the 
TGF-β ligand and receptor, and mice lacking Smad3 were significantly protected 
from Schistosoma-induced pulmonary hypertension. Blockade of TGF-β signaling 
also led to a decrease in interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 concentrations, which 
drive the Th2 responses characteristic of schistosomiasis lung pathology. Lungs 
of patients with schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension have 
evidence of TGF-β signaling in their remodeled pulmonary arteries.
CONCLUSION: Experimental S mansoni-induced pulmonary vascular disease relies on 
canonical TGF-β signaling.

Cerebral and spinal schistosomiasis.

Barcelona, Spain. fjcarod-artal@hotmail.com

Cerebral schistosomiasis and spinal schistosomiasis are severe underrecognized 
complications of Schistosoma sp. infection, and can occur at any time during the 
parasitic infection. Neuroschistosomiasis has been increasingly reported not 
only in endemic areas but also in Western countries owing to immigration and 
international travel. Immunogenic interaction between schistosome egg deposition 
and the delayed hypersensitivity reaction of the host are the main 
neuropathogenic mechanisms involved. Eggs induce a periovular granulomatous 
reaction in the tissues. In some cases, schistosome adult worms may aberrantly 
migrate to the central nervous system via the vertebral venous plexus and place 
the ova at an ectopic site. Headache and seizures are common in cerebral 
schistosomiasis, and intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus may occur in 
tumour-like and cerebellar schistosomiasis. Spinal schistosomiasis may manifest 
itself as acute myelitis and/or myeloradiculopathy. Recognition of 
neuroschistosomiasis is important so that early treatment with praziquantel and 
steroids can be started in an attempt to prevent severe disability.

BACKGROUND: Egg white proteins are usually subjected to heating, making them 
edible for the majority of children with egg allergy.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for 
the reduced allergenicity displayed by heat-treated egg white allergens.
METHODS: C3H/HeJ mice were orally sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) or ovomucoid 
and challenged with native or heated proteins to evaluate their allergenicity. 
Immunoreactivity was assessed by immunoblotting using sera from children with 
egg allergy. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of native and heated OVA and 
ovomucoid was studied by SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography. Intestinal uptake 
of intact native and heated OVA and ovomucoid by human intestinal epithelial 
(Caco-2) cells was investigated. Rat basophil leukemia cells passively 
sensitized with mouse serum and human basophils passively sensitized with serum 
from children with egg allergy were used to assess the effector cell activation 
by heated, digested, and transported OVA and ovomucoid.
RESULTS: Heated OVA and ovomucoid did not induce symptoms of anaphylaxis in 
sensitized mice when administered orally. Heating did not completely destroy 
IgE-binding capacity of OVA or ovomucoid but enhanced in vitro digestibility of 
OVA. Digestion of both OVA and ovomucoid diminished mediator release in rat 
basophil leukemia assay and basophil activation. Heating of allergens prevented 
transport across human intestinal epithelial cells in a form capable of 
triggering basophil activation or T-cell activation.
CONCLUSION: Heat treatment reduces allergenicity of OVA and ovomucoid. This is 
partially a result of the enhanced gastrointestinal digestibility of heated OVA 
and the inability of heated OVA or ovomucoid to be absorbed in a form capable of 
triggering basophils.

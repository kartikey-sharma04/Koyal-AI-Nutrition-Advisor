Gluten proteins in cereal grains are often considered unsafe for health. Indeed, 
the dissemination of misinformation through various sources has led to a 
widespread misconception that the consumption of gluten by healthy individuals 
results in adverse health consequences and contributes to obesity. In recent 
years, many health-conscious consumers have started reducing or avoiding gluten 
consumption without a medical recommendation. Consequently, the adoption of 
gluten-free diets has expanded significantly. This study compared 39 gluten-free 
products and their gluten-containing counterparts for energy, sugar, dietary 
fiber content, and price. We found that, on average, gluten-free products 
available to United States consumers contained significantly less protein and 
more sugar and calories. Furthermore, on average, gluten-free products are more 
expensive than gluten-containing products. Our finding may serve as a guide for 
dietitians, nutritionists, and legislators in introducing a gluten-free 
prescription list for individuals with celiac disease, wheat allergy, and 
non-celiac wheat sensitivity.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental 
condition characterized by social difficulties, speech and nonverbal 
communication issues, and restricted behaviors. Nutritional issues, such as food 
allergies and intolerances, can affect children with ASD. This study aimed to 
evaluate the impact of diet programs on ASD behavior and gastrointestinal 
symptoms, which would be considered as a starting point to increase the family's 
knowledge about how to practice healthy and suitable dieting for their children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional observational study on 45 
children with an autism spectrum disorder in four centers aged 2-18 in Khartoum 
state. Data was collected through an interview questionnaire, which included 
sociodemographic, diet, gastrointestinal, and behavioral assessments. The data 
was analyzed using SPSS to find the correlation between the various variables. 
Independent t-test, Analysis of Variance, and Mann-Whitney test were used in 
univariant analysis to assess the association between study variables, while 
multiple linear regression was used in multivariant analysis for the same 
purpose.
RESULTS: The study involved a large number of children with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD), with 80% being male and 73.3% being school-aged. Most had 
parents as guardians and 71.1% were in intermediate financial status. About 20% 
were overweight or obese, and 57.8% did not have a specific diet program. Food 
selectivity was prevalent, with 22.7% having allergies to milk and wheat. ASD 
children experienced vomiting, gastric reflux, abdominal pain, and changes in 
stool characteristics. A significant link was found between financial status, 
behavioral status and gastrointestinal changes. High financial status was 
significantly different from intermediate and low statuses based on behavioral 
changes. However, no significant association was found in multivariant analysis.
CONCLUSION: The study found that ASD children generally have good nutritional 
health, with a higher degree of dietary selection. The financial status of 
guardians significantly influenced behavioral and gastrointestinal changes in 
the children. Further interventional studies are recommended to assess the 
direct impact of diet programs on these symptoms.

With a variety of symptoms that can impede children's development, food 
allergies are an important public health concern. With the help of information 
from the King Fahad Medical City Hospital in Riyadh, we looked at how 
restricting certain foods affected the growth of Saudi children who had food 
allergies. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire asking about the 
individuals' demographics and their restricted eating habits was completed by 72 
children (48 boys and 24 girls) between the ages of 2 and 14. The sensitivity of 
six allergens (hen eggs, cow milk, fish, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans), 
anthropometric indices, specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and sensitivity 
were examined. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), version 26, 
was used to analyze the data. Chi-square and t-tests were used to examine the 
relationships between various category variables. According to the findings, 
most of the mothers of the children were between the ages of 30 and 40 (80.6%), 
had a college degree (72.3%), were unemployed (59.7%), and had a monthly family 
income between 5000 and 15,000 SAR (69.4%). Both sexes had specific IgE 
antibodies for allergens in classes 2 and 3, with boys having noticeably (p ≤ 
0.05) higher quantities than girls. While females were more sensitive to fish 
and peanuts, boys were more likely than girls to show specific IgE sensitivity 
to egg white, cow milk, wheat, and soybeans. Both sexes' allergy levels were 
considerably (p ≤ 0.01) higher in children aged 5.01 to 10 than in other age 
groups. In terms of classifications of thinness, overweightness, and obesity, 
boys were slenderer than girls, and a greater percentage of boys than girls were 
overweight or obese. The exclusion of hen eggs, cow milk, wheat, and peanuts 
from the diet had a significant and detrimental effect on body mass index (BMI) 
and height-for-age ratio among children with impaired growth, in contrast to the 
demographic factors, which had a significant and favorable effect on the growth 
of other children. In conclusion, restrictions on food allergens impairs growth 
in Saudi children, particularly boys' growth.

BACKGROUND: Bifidobacterium longum ES1 is a strain probiotic, colonizing the 
human gut and capable of a degradative action on gliadin. In an attempt to find 
new nutritional solutions aimed at improving the quality of life of patients 
with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) we evaluated the effectiveness of this 
strain, in association with a gluten-free diet, comparing its efficacy versus 
diet therapy alone.
METHODS: The experimental design included a non-randomized, open-label, 1:1 
intervention study in parallel groups. Enrolled patients with symptoms 
attributable to NCGS, and with negative diagnoses of both wheat allergy and 
celiac disease, were included in this three-month trial divided into four 
outpatient visits (baseline, T1, T2 and T3). Fifteen patients for each group 
completed the experimental protocol.
RESULTS: Our results showed that a combination of diet and probiotic determined 
a more significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of intestinal and 
extra-intestinal symptoms, and a clear improvement in stool consistency.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the study was carried out on a small number of patients, 
the results of our pilot trial suggest that a combined strategy of naturally 
gluten-free diet therapy with administration of the probiotic strain ES1 appears 
to offer a greater advantage than the dietary regime alone in improving the 
clinical symptomatic picture and in stabilizing the intestinal microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity (NCWS) is still a largely undefined 
condition, due to the lack of a diagnostic marker. Few data are available about 
the nutritional characteristics of NCWS patients at diagnosis.
AIMS: To evaluate the proportion of NCWS patients who were underweight, normal 
weight, overweight, or obese at diagnosis, and to search for possible 
correlations between their Body Mass Index (BMI) and other NCWS-related disease 
characteristics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical charts of 145 NCWS patients (125 F, 20 M, 
mean age 37.1 ± 11.4 years), diagnosed between January 2012 and March 2018, were 
reviewed. As a comparison, 84 celiac disease (CD) patients (73 F, 11 M, mean age 
39.8 ± 13.9 years) were evaluated. All NCWS diagnoses were based on a 
double-blind placebo-controlled wheat challenge (DBPCWC) method.
RESULTS: BMI distribution was similar in the NCWS (6.2% underweight and 15.2% 
obese subjects) and CD patients (6% underweight and 7.1% obese subjects). 
Underweight NCWS subjects were significantly younger and had a shorter clinical 
history than the overweight or obese ones. Unlike the other NCWS patients, none 
of them had a DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotype. Overweight and obese NCWS patients were 
more frequently suffering from associated autoimmune diseases than the other BMI 
categories (P = 0.05). Compared to the CD controls, NCWS patients showed a 
higher frequency of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)-like (P = 0.01) and 
extraintestinal symptoms (P = 0.03) and a longer clinical history (P = 0.04), 
whereas weight loss was more frequent in CD (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: NCWS patients showed a BMI distribution similar to CD patients. 
However, NCWS was found to be a heterogenous condition that regards BMI, and 
clinical characteristics differed between the underweight and overweight/obese 
patients.

We aimed to assess the possible relationship between food allergy and two key 
adipokines - leptin and adiponectin - in children with food allergy. A total of 
forty patients with definite diagnosis of food allergy according to clinical 
history and specific IgE (sIgE) for food allergens (group I) were enrolled in 
this pilot study. The control group (group II) included thirty children with no 
evidence of allergic symptoms. Serum levels of leptin and adiponectin were 
measured by ELISA. Meanwhile, sIgE was measured for the eight most common food 
allergens by the immunoblot method in all participants. The median ages in 
groups I and II were 18·5 and 23·5 months, respectively. The respective 
Caesarean section rate was 64·9 and 16·7 % in groups I and II (P<0·001). Serum 
levels of adiponectin were significantly higher in the patient group compared 
with controls (24·11 (sd 12·14) v. 10·67 (sd 12·23) μg/ml, P<0·001), whereas no 
statistically meaningful difference was detected in serum leptin concentrations 
(P=0·92). There was a significant inverse relationship between age and 
adiponectin levels in group I (P=0·002, r -0·479) and group II (P=0·04, r 
-0·365), and it was more significant in group I. The most common allergens in 
the patient group were wheat (52·5 %), hazelnut (52·5 %), cow's milk (50 %) and 
egg white (30 %). The results of this study suggest an essential link between 
adiponectin and food allergy that is probably unlikely to be affected by obesity 
as a confounding factor.

BACKGROUND: Serum IgG and IgA food antibodies have been used for dietary advice 
to subjects with gastrointestinal symptoms and perceived food intolerance, but 
the role of these antibodies in mediating intolerance is controversial. The 
present study investigated associations between perceived gastrointestinal 
intolerance to milk-or wheat and the corresponding s-IgG and s-IgA food 
antibodies in subjects with morbid obesity.
METHODS: Subjects with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 or ≥35 kg/m2 with 
obesity-related complications) were included. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) was 
diagnosed based on the Rome III criteria. Severity of specific gastrointestinal 
symptoms were measured with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale 
(GSRS)-IBS. S-IgG against cow's milk, cheese, wheat and gluten, and s-IgA 
against casein and gliadin were measured.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven subjects (80 females) with mean age 45 (SD 8.4) years were 
included, 70 had gastrointestinal complaints, 25 had IBS, and 22 and 20 reported 
milk- and wheat- intolerance respectively. There were no significant differences 
in serum concentrations or proportions of subjects above defined cut-off values 
for the antibodies between subjects with and without gastrointestinal 
complaints. In the group with gastrointestinal complaints, no significant 
differences were found between subjects with and without perceived food 
intolerance. Except for a significant correlation between IgG against cheese and 
GSRS-diarrhea (Rho: -0.25, P = 0.04), no significant correlations were found 
between the antibodies and type or degree of gastrointestinal symptoms, 
including IBS.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed no associations between perceived milk or wheat 
intolerance and the corresponding s-IgG and s-IgA food antibodies in subjects 
with morbid obesity.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often report food 
hypersensitivities with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms despite being in clinical 
remission. We aimed to identify the most frequent symptoms and dietary triggers 
in such patients, and also explored whether a strict elimination diet may reduce 
their GI symptoms.
METHODS: We assessed GI symptoms and dietary triggers in 16 patients with CD in 
clinical remission. Of these, 12 patients subsequently participated in a dietary 
intervention trial: two weeks on a habitual diet including wheat and dairy 
products followed by two weeks of a strict elimination diet. The severity of 
seven symptoms (overall symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, abnormal feces, 
wind, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain) was measured by using visual analog 
scales throughout the four weeks intervention period.
MAIN RESULTS: The most common symptoms were abdominal pain, wind, bloating, 
odorous wind/feces, and diarrhea. Dairy and wheat products were reported as the 
most frequent dietary symptom triggers. All symptoms improved (p < .05) during 
the elimination diet period, especially in patients with small intestinal 
affection.
CONCLUSION: Our exploratory study suggests that dietary interventions such as an 
elimination diet may reduce GI symptoms in patients with CD in remission.

AIM: Our study examined the growth and nutritional intake of children on milk 
and/or wheat, barley or rye elimination diets.
METHODS: This was a nested case-control study within the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes 
Prediction and Prevention Study. It investigated 295 children born in the 
Tampere University Hospital area between 1997 and 2004 on a diet without cows' 
milk and/or wheat, barley or rye due to food allergies and 265 matched controls. 
Nutritional intake was recorded with three-day food records at the ages of one, 
two and three years. Serial growth measurements were recorded annually up to the 
age of five years.
RESULTS: Despite consuming a balanced diet with sufficient energy and protein, 
the children on milk elimination diets grew slower than the control children (p 
= 0.009). Wheat, barley or rye elimination was not associated with growth. The 
intakes of protein and calcium were lower in children in the milk elimination 
group than the controls, at p < 0.05 for all. However, children on elimination 
diets consumed less saturated fats and sugar and more vitamin C and iron than 
the control children.
CONCLUSION: Children on elimination diets faced an increased risk of growth 
deceleration and suboptimal intake of several micronutrients.

cDivision of Allergy and Immunology, Cincinnati Children's Medical Center, 
Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modalities and timing of the introduction of solid foods to 
infants may influence growth, obesity, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic disease. The most debated effects of solid 
foods introduction are those on the development of food allergy.
RECENT FINDINGS: For the first time, in recent years prospective studies have 
been published about the effects of early vs. delayed introduction of allergenic 
foods into the infants' diet on food allergy. According to these studies, the 
early introduction of peanut may be a powerful protecting factor against peanut 
allergy in some risk categories. This seems not be true for wheat, cow's milk, 
sesame, and whitefish. The effect of early introduction of egg on egg allergy 
are controversial.
SUMMARY: The recent studies have changed the practice recommendations given by 
healthcare providers to families. We review the modifications of the 
recommendations of international societies on the introduction of solid foods, 
both to the general population and to infants at risk for allergy.

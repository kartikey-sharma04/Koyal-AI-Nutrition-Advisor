Consumption of nuts and seeds is associated with a range of health outcomes. 
Summarizing the best evidence on essential health outcomes from the consumption 
of nuts is essential to provide optimal recommendations. Our objective is to 
comprehensively assess health outcome associations related to the consumption of 
nuts and seeds, using a culinary definition including tree nuts and peanuts 
(registered in PROSPERO: CRD42021258300). Health outcomes of interest include 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, respiratory disease, 
mortality, and their disease biomarkers. We present associations for high 
compared with low consumption, per serving, and dose-response relations. 
MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos were searched and screened for 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Evidence was extracted from 89 articles on 
the consumption of nuts and relevant health outcomes, including 23 articles with 
meta-analysis on disease and mortality, 66 articles on biomarkers for disease, 
and 9 articles on allergy/adverse outcomes. Intake of nuts was associated with 
reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and related risk factors, with moderate 
quality of evidence. An intake of 28 g/d nuts compared with not eating nuts was 
associated with a 21% RR reduction of cardiovascular disease (including coronary 
heart disease incidence and mortality, atrial fibrillation, and stroke 
mortality), an 11% risk reduction of cancer deaths, and 22% reduction in 
all-cause mortality. Nut consumption was also inversely associated with 
mortality from respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, and diabetes; however, 
associations between nut consumption and diabetes incidence were mixed. 
Meta-analyses of trials on biomarkers for disease generally mirrored 
meta-analyses from observational studies on cardiovascular disease, cancers, and 
diabetes. Allergy and related adverse reactions to nuts were observed in 1-2% of 
adult populations, with substantial heterogeneity between studies. Overall, the 
current evidence supports dietary recommendations to consume a handful of nuts 
and seeds per day for people without allergies to these foods.

Diet plays a key role in the maintenance and optimal functioning of immune 
cells. The Mediterranean dietary pattern is an example of a prudent choice of 
lifestyle and scientifically accepted to help preserve human health by 
protecting against major chronic and inflammatory diseases. Mediterranean diets 
(MedDiets) are characteristically high in the consumption of fruits, vegetables 
and salad, bread and whole grain cereals, potatoes, legumes/beans, nuts, and 
seeds. Their common central feature is the usage of olive oil as the main source 
of fat. The health benefits attributed to olive oil are specifically related to 
extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) intake with its high nutritional quality and 
multiple positive effects on health. Overall, MedDiets have direct 
(mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), tocopherols, polyphenols) and indirect 
(low saturated fats, well-balanced linoleic/alpha linolenic acid) effects on the 
immune system and inflammatory responses. In the present paper, we summarize the 
current knowledge on the effect of olive oil per se and MedDiets generally on 
immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases, such as coronary heart disease 
(CHD)/cardiovascular diseases (CVD), obesity, type-2 diabetes, cancer, asthma, 
and allergies.

Milk beverages derived from plant-based protein have attracted the interest of 
consumers and researchers as a health-promoting functional food. It can also be 
considered as a substitute for animal milk due to various allergy concerns 
associated with dairy milk. The plant-based emulsions are directed to prevent 
diet-related chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular, obesity and 
other disorders due to the presence of healthy long-chain unsaturated fatty 
acids as compared to bovine milk. Further, associations between nutritional 
contents (vitamins, minerals and low fat) and pharmacological properties of 
plant-based protein may have extra beneficial effects. The review aims to 
summarize the four different groups of plant sources (nuts, cereals, seeds and 
legumes) used for the preparation of plant-based milk beverages. In addition, it 
also provides a detailed review of the general characteristics and functional 
properties of these plant sources. Physicochemical composition, protein and fats 
quality, functional properties, effect of heat and high-pressure treatment is 
also provided in detail. It also covers fats digestibility, protein stability, 
protein solubility and digestibility. Furthermore, the effect of processing, 
possible comparative study and potential applications in healthcare have been 
discussed.

BACKGROUND: Intake of nuts has been inversely associated with risk of type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease, partly through inducing a healthy lipid 
profile. How nut intake may affect lipid metabolites remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the plasma lipid metabolites 
associated with habitual nut consumption in US men and women.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 1099 participants in the Nurses' 
Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Metabolic 
profiling was conducted on plasma by LC-mass spectrometry. Nut intake was 
estimated from food-frequency questionnaires. We included 144 known lipid 
metabolites that had CVs ≤25%. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess 
the associations of nut consumption with individual plasma lipid metabolites.
RESULTS: We identified 17 lipid metabolites that were significantly associated 
with nut intake, based on a 1 serving (28 g)/d increment in multivariate models 
[false discovery rate (FDR) P value <0.05]. Among these species, 8 were 
positively associated with nut intake [C24:0 sphingomyelin (SM), C36:3 
phosphatidylcholine (PC) plasmalogen-A, C36:2 PC plasmalogen, C24:0 ceramide, 
C36:1 PC plasmalogen, C22:0 SM, C34:1 PC plasmalogen, and C36:2 
phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen], with changes in relative metabolite level 
(expressed in number of SDs on the log scale) ranging from 0.36 to 0.46 for 1 
serving/d of nuts. The other 9 metabolites were inversely associated with nut 
intake with changes in relative metabolite level ranging from -0.34 to -0.44. In 
stratified analysis, 3 metabolites were positively associated with both peanuts 
and peanut butter (C24:0 SM, C24:0 ceramide, and C22:0 SM), whereas 6 
metabolites were inversely associated with other nuts (FDR P value <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A panel of lipid metabolites was associated with intake of nuts, 
which may provide insight into biological mechanisms underlying associations 
between nuts and cardiometabolic health. Metabolites that were positively 
associated with intake of nuts may be helpful in identifying potential 
biomarkers of nut intake.

BACKGROUND: Angioedema (AE) is acute oedema of the skin and mucous surfaces, 
involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. AE could be a 
life-threatening medical condition. Regardless of its growing clinical 
importance, many aspects of its aetiology and pathogenesis remain poorly 
understood. Its incidence, demographic characteristics, diagnosis and therapy, 
need further investigation.
AIM: This study reports our experience with angioedema concerning its social and 
demographic characteristics, aetiology, clinical features, diagnosis and 
treatment outcomes. Study design: Eighty-eight patients with AE were enrolled. 
The study is a retrospective analysis of patients treated in our Clinics.
METHODS: All participants were asked on a voluntary basis to fill out a 
specially designed questionnaire on the day of their discharge. Other important 
data sources included: patients' history and notes during the hospital stay, 
information from previous admissions, etc. Parametric and non-parametric 
statistical methods were used for data processing. Data analysis was performed 
using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM SPSS Statistica) version 20.0.
RESULTS: Based on our results, AE affects more frequently patients over 50 years 
of age, regardless of their sex. Urban residents prevail, among them - more 
commonly working women. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormones 
and antibiotics were among the most common triggers - in 8%, 4.5% and 11.4% of 
the cases respectively. In 9.09% of the patients, food-induced AE was seen, the 
most common foods reported, were - nuts, eggs and egg products. The common sites 
of involvement were periorbital area and lips. In only 9.1% of the patients, 
oedema progressed to spread to the upper respiratory tract. Cardiac conditions 
were the most frequent underlying disorders - 33%, of the patients, auto-immune 
thyroiditis was the second most common-14.8%, followed by musculo- skeletal 
disorders (10.2%) and diabetes (4.5%) Family history of allergy was seen in 8.4% 
of the patients, the most frequent allergic disorder, reported, was asthma. In 
patients with HAE, family history was present in 2.9% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients received therapy with steroids and antihistamines, 
resulting in resolution of symptoms and no invasive procedures were necessary. 
Based on our results, the diagnosis of AE is often difficult and delayed and 
requires specialist evaluation. If recognised on time and adequately treated, 
the outcomes are favourable.

The genus of Pistacia plant systematically fits into the family of 
Anacardiaceae. Pistachios contain protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibers, fat, 
folic acid, vitamin K, magnesium and potassium, gama-tocopherols, 
phytochemicals, and polyphenols. Collectively, these constituents have been 
shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions to improve overall 
health when consumed as a healthy diet. We searched the following keywords 
within the literature databases: pistachio, heart disorders, lipids, weight, 
antioxidants, and allergy. Further searching theses keywords, we have found 50 
articles in PubMed, 40 articles in ISI web of knowledge and 30 articles in 
Google Scholar. We have selected 100 articles, among them 80 articles were used 
as the references of this review. In the current article, we have discussed the 
most recent data published regarding the regulatory effects of pistachios on 
several clinical states such as heart related disorders, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, vascular stiffness and endothelial and gut functions, weight 
management, glucose metabolism, kidney function and finally allergies.

A 51-year-old woman with a history of asthma and Hashimoto's thyroiditis 
presented to the dermatology service with a chief complaint of "itchy bumpy 
rashes" that persisted beyond 24 hours. She noted that, 3 days prior to the 
onset of urticaria, a pyrroloquinoline quinone supplement had been started. The 
urticaria was accompanied by variable episodes of transient facial swelling and 
difficulty breathing. The patient noted that exposure to fish, nuts, and 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs triggered facial swelling. Other reported 
findings included a 5-year history of diarrhea, sense of memory deterioration, 
concentration difficulties, and clinical manifestations of anomic aphasia. 
Although her allergy testing was "negative," she had been given the diagnoses of 
lactose intolerance and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Laboratory studies on 
initial presentation were significant for a positive history of 
antithyroperoxidase antibodies and elevated total complement activity. 
Medications included budesonide/formoterol, fluticasone/salmeterol, 
levothyroxine, albuterol, and fexofenadine 180 mg twice daily. Although her 
"rash" had initially responded to fexofenadine, it soon became refractory to 
treatment. Her family history was significant only for thyroid disease.

Chronic inflammation is a prolonged and dysregulated immune response leading to 
a wide variety of physiological and pathological conditions such as neurological 
abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, pulmonary diseases, 
immunological diseases, cancers, and other life-threatening conditions. 
Therefore, inhibition of persistent inflammation will reduce the risk of 
inflammation-associated chronic diseases. Inflammation-related chronic diseases 
require chronic treatment without side effects. Use of traditional medicines and 
restricted diet has been utilized by mankind for ages to prevent or treat 
several chronic diseases. Bioactive dietary agents or "Nutraceuticals" present 
in several fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, fibers, and certain spices have 
shown potential to inhibit or reverse the inflammatory responses and several 
chronic diseases related to chronic inflammation. Due to safe, nontoxic, and 
preventive benefits, the use of nutraceuticals as dietary supplements or 
functional foods has increased in the Western world. Fisetin 
(3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a dietary flavonoid found in various fruits 
(strawberries, apples, mangoes, persimmons, kiwis, and grapes), vegetables 
(tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers), nuts, and wine that has shown strong 
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-tumorigenic, anti-invasive, 
anti-angiogenic, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects in 
cell culture and in animal models relevant to human diseases. In this chapter, 
we discuss the beneficial pharmacological effects of fisetin against different 
pathological conditions with special emphasis on diseases related to chronic 
inflammatory conditions.

BACKGROUND: Increased nut consumption has been associated with reduced risk of 
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, as well as a healthy lipid profile. 
However, the associations between nut consumption and inflammatory biomarkers 
are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated habitual nut consumption in relation to inflammatory 
biomarkers in 2 large cohorts of US men and women.
DESIGN: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 5013 participants in the Nurses' 
Health Study (NHS) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) who were free 
of diabetes. Nut intake, defined as intake of peanuts and other nuts, was 
estimated from food-frequency questionnaires, and cumulative averages from 1986 
and 1990 in the NHS and from 1990 and 1994 in the HPFS were used. Plasma 
biomarkers were collected in 1989-1990 in the NHS and 1993-1995 in the HPFS. 
Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the associations of nut 
consumption with fasting plasma C-reactive protein (CRP, n = 4941), interleukin 
6 (IL-6, n = 2859), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2, n = 2905).
RESULTS: A greater intake of nuts was associated with lower amounts of a subset 
of inflammatory biomarkers, after adjusting for demographic, medical, dietary, 
and lifestyle variables. The relative concentrations (ratios) and 95% CIs 
comparing subjects with nut intake of ≥5 times/wk and those in the categories of 
never or almost never were as follows: CRP: 0.80 (0.69, 0.90), P-trend = 0.0003; 
and IL-6: 0.86 (0.77, 0.97), P-trend = 0.006. These associations remained 
significant after further adjustment for body mass index. No significant 
association was observed with TNFR2. Substituting 3 servings of nuts/wk for 3 
servings of red meat, processed meat, eggs, or refined grains/wk was associated 
with significantly lower CRP (all P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (P ranges from 0.001 to 
0.017).
CONCLUSION: Frequent nut consumption was associated with a healthy profile of 
inflammatory biomarkers.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a common neoplasm that is known to be causally 
associated with genetic factors and environmental carcinogens. The receptor for 
advanced glycosylation endproducts (RAGE) is a transmembrane protein of the 
immunoglobulin superfamily with broad specificity for multiple ligands, and it 
has been shown to play vital roles in several pathophysiologic processes, 
including diabetes, Alzheimer disease, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, 
and cancer. The present study aimed to assess the influences of RAGE gene 
polymorphisms, combined with environmental carcinogens on the predisposition to 
oral tumorigenesis. Five polymorphisms of the RAGE gene-including -374T>A 
(rs1800624), -429T>C (rs1800625), 1704G>T (rs184003), Gly82Ser (rs2070600), and 
a 63-bp deletion allele (-407 to -345)-were examined from 592 controls and 618 
patients with oral cancer. We found that individuals carrying the polymorphic 
allele of rs1800625 are more susceptible to oral cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.899; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.355 to 2.661; adjusted OR [AOR], 2.053; 95% CI, 
1.269 to 3.345) after adjustment for age, sex, betel nut chewing, and tobacco 
consumption. Moreover, we observed a significant association of rs1800625 
variants with late-stage tumors (stage III/IV, OR, 1.736; 95% CI, 1.126 to 
2.677; AOR, 1.771; 95% CI, 1.101 to 2.851) and large-size tumors (>2 cm in the 
greatest dimension; OR, 1.644; 95% CI, 1.083 to 2.493; AOR, 1.728; 95% CI, 1.089 
to 2.741). Based on behavioral exposure of environmental carcinogens, the 
presence of 4 RAGE single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), combined with betel 
quid chewing and/or tobacco use, greatly augmented the risk of oral cancer. In 
addition, carriers of particular haplotypes of the 4 RAGE SNPs examined are more 
prone to develop oral cancer. These results indicate an involvement of RAGE SNP 
rs1800625 in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma and implicate the 
interaction between RAGE gene polymorphisms and environmental mutagens as a 
predisposing factor of oral carcinogenesis.

Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) pose a growing healthcare challenge, with a 
substantial proportion of patients showing inadequate response to biological 
treatment. There is renewed interest in dietary changes to optimize treatment 
regimens, with a growing body of evidence suggesting beneficial effects with 
adherence to a gluten-free diet. This study compared the likelihood of achieving 
clinical response to biological treatment after 14-16 weeks in patients with CID 
with high versus low-to-medium gluten intake. Secondary outcomes of interest 
included changes in disease activity, health-related quality of life and 
C-reactive protein. The study was a multicentre prospective cohort of 193 
participants with a CID diagnosis (i.e. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, 
Rheumatoid Arthritis, Axial Spondyloarthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis or Psoriasis) 
who initiated biological treatment between 2017 and 2020. Participants were 
stratified based on their habitual gluten intake: the upper 33.3% (high gluten 
intake) and the remaining 66.6% (low-to-medium gluten intake). The proportion of 
patients achieving clinical response to biological treatment after 14-16 weeks 
was compared using logistic regression models. The median gluten intake differed 
significantly between groups (12.5 g/day vs. 5.9 g/day, standardized mean 
difference = 1.399). In total, 108 (56%) achieved clinical response to 
treatment, with no difference between 35 (55%) in the high gluten group and 73 
(57%) in the medium-to-low gluten group (OR = 0.96 [0.51-1.79], p = 0.897). No 
differences were found with secondary outcomes. In conclusion, this study found 
no association between gluten intake and response to biological treatment in 
patients with CID.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition with cutaneous and 
systemic involvement. Although many efficacious treatment options are available, 
concerns regarding costs and duration of treatment have expanded interest in the 
role of integrative medical therapies for psoriasis.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim to provide evidence for the use of integrative 
medical approaches in the management of psoriasis, namely approaches utilizing 
the microbiome, probiotics, diet, and mindfulness.
METHODS: PubMed/Medline and Google Scholar databases were searched from 
inception up to 16 August 2023 to identify clinical studies that evaluated how 
integrative medical therapies affect psoriasis severity. Search terms combined 
"psoriasis" or "psoriatic arthritis" with terms related to the microbiome, diet, 
and lifestyle.
RESULTS: Multiple clinical studies have shown that integrative approaches can 
reduce psoriasis severity. Probiotic supplementation in psoriatic patients 
decreased PASI scores, decreased inflammatory markers, increased quality of 
life, and reduced the risk of disease relapse. Intermittent fasting, in the 
context of Ramadan, decreased PASI scores and plasma CRP levels. Low-calorie 
diets and low-calorie ketogenic diets have been shown to reduce psoriasis 
severity. Notably, combining low-calorie diets with biologics and cyclosporine 
synergistically improved psoriasis to a greater extent than pharmaceutical 
therapy alone. A gluten-free diet improved psoriasis and reduced antigliadin 
antibodies in those with hypersensitivity. Mindfulness therapies also improved 
psoriasis severity with and without phototherapy.
CONCLUSION: Several studies show that integrative medicine can be used to manage 
psoriasis. Specifically, probiotic supplementation, diets that promote weight 
loss or modulate antigliadin antibodies, and mindfulness therapies may improve 
disease severity.

INTRODUCTION: Plaque psoriasis and celiac disease are multisystemic diseases. 
The association of psoriasis and enteropathy with histological changes similar 
to celiac disease has already been described, and it has also been found that a 
gluten-free diet improves psoriatic changes. This study assesses the 
relationship between celiac disease antibodies and psoriasis.
METHODS: The study included 112 participants: 60 with psoriasis in a test group 
and 52 healthy subjects in a control group. Within the psoriasis group, 
participants were further divided into two subgroups: one consisting of patients 
with both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (n = 17) and another comprising 
patients with psoriasis alone (n = 43). After informed consent was obtained, the 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score and Psoriasis Area and Severity 
Index (PASI) score were evaluated. Laboratory tests included assessment of 
anti-deaminated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP), anti-gliadin antibodies (AGA), 
and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG).
RESULTS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) DGP antibodies were 
detected more frequently and at higher serum concentrations in patients with 
psoriasis compared to healthy controls (p = 0.03, p = 0.04, respectively). 
Similarly, elevated levels of IgG-tTG antibodies (p = 0.003) and IgA-DGP 
antibodies (p = 0.02) were observed in the same test group.
CONCLUSIONS: A relationship between positivity to celiac disease antibodies and 
psoriasis, particularly with regard to AGA, has been identified. Further studies 
are required to elucidate the nature, pathophysiology, and significance of these 
findings.

Recent advances in palmoplantar pustulosis.

Brunasso AMG(1), Massone C(1).

Author information:

Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a chronic inflammatory condition where crops of 
sterile pustules with erythematous keratotic lesions causing bleeding and pain 
appear on the palms and soles. Recently, the European Rare and Severe Expert 
Network considered PPP as a variant of pustular psoriasis with or without 
psoriasis vulgaris. The prevalence of PPP varies from 0.050 to 0.12%. PPP occurs 
more frequently in women and the highest prevalence occurred between the ages of 
50 and 69 years. Nail psoriasis seems to be frequent in PPP, ranging from 30 to 
76%, and psoriatic arthritis in 8.6 to 26% of PPP patients. Synovitis, acne, 
pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome and pustulotic 
arthro-osteitis are considered PPP-associated disorders. PPP has been reported 
with other co-morbidities such as psychiatric disorders, thyroid-associated 
disease, altered calcium homeostasis, gluten sensitivity diabetes, obesity, and 
dyslipidemia, but larger studies are required to prove such associations. 
Environmental exacerbating factors might contribute to the onset or worsening of 
PPP such as cigarette smoking, stress, focal infections, metal allergies, and 
drug intake. Genetic predisposition plays an important role in PPP. In PPP, both 
the innate and the adaptive immune systems are activated. The acrosyringeal 
expression of IL-17 has been demonstrated, indicating that the eccrine sweat 
gland is an active component of the skin barrier and an immune-competent 
structure. Increased levels of several inflammatory molecules, including IL-8, 
IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23A, and IL-23 receptor, 
have been detected in PPP biopsies. Increased serum levels of TNF-α, IL-17, 
IL-22, and IFN-γ have been detected in patients with PPP in comparison to 
healthy subjects, suggesting a similar inflammatory pattern to psoriasis 
vulgaris. Oral and tonsillar infections serve as trigger factors for PPP. 
Long-term therapy is required for many patients, but high-quality data are 
limited, contributing to uncertainty about the ideal approach to treatment.

BACKGROUND: Associations between gluten intake and psoriasis, psoriatic 
arthritis, and atopic dermatitis are poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether increased gluten intake is associated with 
incident psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis.
METHODS: Cohort studies among women in Nurses' Health Study II. Food frequency 
questionnaires were used to calculate gluten content of participants' diet every 
4 years (1991-2015 for psoriatic disease, 1995-2013 for atopic dermatitis). 
Disease outcomes were assessed by self-report and subsequently validated. 
Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate 
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between gluten 
intake (quintiles) and psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis.
RESULTS: We included 85,185 participants in the psoriasis analysis, 85,324 in 
the psoriatic arthritis analysis, and 63,443 in the atopic dermatitis analysis. 
Increased gluten intake was not associated with any of the outcomes (all P for 
trend >.05). Comparing highest and lowest gluten intake quintiles, the 
multivariable hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.15 (0.98-1.36) for 
psoriasis, 1.12 (0.78-1.62) for psoriatic arthritis, and 0.91 (0.66-1.25) for 
atopic dermatitis.
LIMITATIONS: No assessment of a strictly gluten-free diet.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the amount of dietary gluten intake as 
a risk factor for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or atopic dermatitis in adult 
women.

Going Against the Grains: Gluten-Free Diets in Patients Without Celiac 
Disease-Worthwhile or Not?

While the gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only known effective therapy for celiac 
disease, in recent years it has become increasingly popular in the USA and 
worldwide, with many believing it to be more "healthful" and others claiming 
that it has beneficial effects for health conditions, many extraintestinal, 
other than celiac disease. This review examines the evidence for use of the GFD 
in patients without celiac disease who self-report intestinal and/or 
extraintestinal symptoms (non-celiac gluten sensitivity), as well as for 
enhancement of athletic performance and treatment of autism, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and psychiatric disorders. Overall, the evidence for use of GFDs in 
conditions other than celiac disease is poor. Though non-celiac gluten 
sensitivity may ultimately emerge as a biomarker-defined condition, a large 
proportion of patients with apparent non-celiac gluten sensitivity have, after 
careful investigation, an alternative diagnosis. In light of this, and coupled 
with the potential physical and psychological harms associated with the 
avoidance of gluten, initiating a GFD should not be encouraged for people who 
have these other conditions or are seeking physical/athletic enhancement.

Gluten and Neuroimmunology. Rare association with Myasthenia Gravis and 
Literature Review.

As the celiac disease (CD), the non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has also 
been associated with several autoimmune manifestations. It is rarely associated 
with myasthenia gravis (MG). This paper shall introduce the case of a young 
female patient, initially presenting a peripheral neuropathy framework. During 
clinical and neurological follow-up, she began to present symptoms of various 
immune-mediated morbidities. Diseases related to gluten represent a clinical 
spectrum of manifestations with a trigger in common, the ingestion of gluten. CD 
is the most well-known and serious disease of the spectrum, also called 
gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The NCGS is diagnosed from clinical evidence of 
improvement in symptoms followed by a Gluten Free Diet (GFD) in patients without 
signs of enteropathy in duodenal biopsy. There are indications that, although 
rare, with a prevalence of 1 in 5000, myasthenia gravis (MG) may occur more 
often when CD is also present. Between 13 to 22% of the patients with MG have a 
second autoimmune disorder. However, it is often associated with dermatomyositis 
or polymyositis, lupus erythematosussystemic lupus erythematosus, Addison's 
disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the 
symptoms of neuromuscular junction involvement may give a diagnostic evidence of 
this rare association.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Celiac disease (CD) is a common enteropathy triggered by the 
ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It is frequently 
found in conjunction with other autoimmune diseases. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the prevalence of CD in patients with juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA) and those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in southwestern Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 53 children with JIA and 55 adults with RA 
were enrolled. Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin (Ig) A serum 
levels were measured by performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Patients with anti-tTG IgA serum levels of >15 U/mL were considered seropositive 
and subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Duodenal biopsies were 
histopathologically evaluated based on the modified Marsh classification.
RESULTS: One child with JIA (1.8%) and six adults with RA (11.3%) were positive 
for the anti-tTG IgA antibody, but the histopathological evaluations of the 
duodenal biopsies in these patients revealed no evidence of CD-related 
enteropathy.
CONCLUSION: Although the investigation of anti-tTG antibodies is widely used as 
a noninvasive serologic test for the initial diagnosis of CD, because of the 
high positive predictive value, the clinical utility of this test alone for 
making a diagnosis is doubtful. We found no cases of CD among our patients with 
JIA and RA. The periodic screening of rheumatologic patients with positive 
anti-tTG IgA for CD can be helpful in making an early diagnosis of CD in these 
patients.

Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune enteropathy based disorder 
that is triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible 
individuals. The global prevalence of 1% to 2% represents only the tip of the 
iceberg. The diagnosis is confirmed by positive specific antibody, 
anti-transglutaminase or anti-endomysium, specific lesions of the small 
intestine and a response to strict gluten-free diet. The diagnosis is difficult 
and often delayed because the clinical variability is very large, ranging from 
digestive clinical presentation "classic" to "atypical" symptoms, often 
extra-intestinal, that are sometimes attributed to a concomitant disease or a 
complication. Among them, there are frequent musculoskeletal manifestations such 
as osteoporosis and osteomalacia. In the absence of risk factor, osteoporosis, 
in a premenopausal women or in a man less than 55 years, more is if it is severe 
and refractory to medications, need to rheumatologists on the track of celiac 
disease in the absence of digestive symptoms. Osteomalacia is related to 
secondary hypovitaminosis D malabsorption. Supplementation by calcifediol, 
water-soluble vitamin D, may be indicated. Celiac disease is associated with an 
autoimmune disease in almost 1/3 of the cases. Knowing these potential 
associations allows earlier diagnosis in patients whose only manifestation, a 
concomitant disease. Anemia, chronic fatigue or unexplained polyarthralgia are 
symptoms associated with celiac disease to look for specific antibodies. The aim 
of early diagnosis is to prevent the emergence of other systemic disorders and 
avoid complications such as bone fractures and cancer, especially intestinal 
lymphoma. Non-celiac gluten intolerance is a new entity defined by 
symptomatology similar to that of celiac disease induced by the ingestion of 
gluten and disappearing after crowding-out, among patients without specific 
antibodies and without intestinal lesion of celiac disease. This entity is a 
cause, at least in part, of increasing interest in gluten-free diet in the 
general population.

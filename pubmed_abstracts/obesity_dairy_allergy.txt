Recently, the non-intestinal functions of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) 
have been widely documented, including their roles in promoting brain 
development and growth, as well as ameliorating anxiety, allergies, and obesity. 
Understanding their mechanisms of action is becoming increasingly critical. 
Furthermore, these effects are frequently associated with the type and structure 
of HMOs. As an innovative technology, "plant factory" is expected to complement 
traditional synthesis technology. This study reviews the novel "plant factory" 
synthesis techniques. Particular emphasis is placed on the processes, 
advantages, and limitations of "plant factory" synthesis of HMOs. This 
technology can express genes related to HMO synthesis instantaneously in plant 
leaves, thereby enabling the rapid and cost-effective generation of HMOs. 
However, "plant factory" technology remains underdeveloped, and challenges 
related to low yield and unsustainable production must be addressed. 
Furthermore, we present an overview of the most recent clinical and preclinical 
studies on the non-intestinal functions of HMOs. This review emphasizes the 
mechanisms of action underlying the non-intestinal functions of HMOs. HMOs 
primarily exert non-intestinal functions through the cleavage of beneficial 
monomer components, metabolism to produce advantageous metabolites, and 
regulation of immune responses.

Fermented fruits and vegetables are rich in phenolic compounds, minerals, and 
vitamins, which have potential health benefits for the prevention of many 
diseases such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. There is a growing 
demand for the development of nondairy probiotic products based on fruits and 
vegetables in view of changing lifestyles (e.g., vegetarianism, veganism, and 
allergy to dairy products) and the rise of nutritional diet therapy. In this 
review, the processes and health potential of fermented fruits and vegetables 
are described. The study focuses on the role of bacteria and fungi in fermented 
fruits and vegetables, outlines the process of transformation of bioactive 
components, and systematically summarizes the possible mechanisms of 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and blood pressure-lowering effects. The health 
effects of fermented fruits and vegetables depend mainly on the microorganisms 
present in the fermentation process and the bioactive components they produce, 
such as phenols, vitamins, and organic acids. These active compounds exert many 
health effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, 
hypotensive, hypoglycemic, and other health benefits. Therefore, the development 
of fermented foods based on fruits and vegetables can be a promising way to 
adapt to the market demand and to reduce the wastage of agriculturally produced 
fruits and vegetables.

Cats are increasingly favored as companion animals; their health has drawn 
widespread attention. Given the continuous improvements in the required living 
standards of both humans and animals, inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, 
diarrhea, constipation, periodontal disease, obesity, diabetes, and other health 
issues have become recognized as valid pet problems. Antibiotics are commonly 
used to treat pet diseases, greatly improving animal health. However, antibiotic 
abuse is common, especially when seeking to treat bacterial infections. 
Probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that may be directly ingested in food 
or as feed additives; they improve the intestinal microflora balance, enhance 
immunity, and ensure healthy growth. However, cat data are usually inferred from 
reports on dogs or humans; cat research remains preliminary in nature. 
Therefore, we here describe the current understanding of how probiotics improve 
cat health, facilitating the further development and application of probiotics 
for cats.

Signs and symptoms attributed to adverse reactions to foodstuffs (ARFS) need 
tools for research and evaluation in clinical practice. The objectives of this 
study were (a) to evaluate the most frequent self-reported signs and symptoms 
attributed to ARFS in Spanish adults, (b) to determine the prevalence of 
food-specific IgG4 antibody reactions (AbRs), and (c) to investigate the 
association between self-reported ARFS symptomatology and food-specific IgG4 
AbRs. Food-specific IgG4 AbRs against 57 common food and beverages 
(AESKUCARE-T2FA® in vitro point-of-care test kit, Aesku.Diagnostics GmbH, 
Germany) were determined in capillary blood samples of 205 volunteers living in 
the Region of Madrid (Spain). The most frequent self-reported signs and symptoms 
were related to skin (43%), digestive (41%), and nervous system (NS, 33%) 
problems. The prevalence of food-specific IgG4 AbRs was cow's milk (73%), 
sheep's milk (70%), casein (66%), and goat's milk (56.10%). Positive IgG4 AbRs 
against tomato had a profile consisting of 3/4 of skin problems, more than half 
of digestive, and 2/5 of NS self-reported signs and symptoms. In conclusion, at 
least 1/3 of the studied sample reported skin, digestive, and NS signs and 
symptoms. The most frequent food-specific IgG4 AbRs were related to dairy. Skin 
problems were more frequent in positive tomato IgG4 AbRs.

Camel milk (CM), known for its immune-regulatory, anti-inflammatory, 
antiapoptotic, and antidiabetic properties, is a natural healthy food. It is 
easily digestible due to the high levels of β-casein and diverse secreted 
antibodies, exhibiting superior antibacterial and antiviral activities compared 
with bovine milk. β-casein is less allergic and more digestible because it is 
more susceptible to digestive hydrolysis in the gut; therefore, higher levels of 
β-casein make CM advantageous for human health. Furthermore, antibodies help the 
digestive system by destroying the antigens, which are then overwhelmed and 
digested by macrophages. The connection between the gut microbiota and human 
health has gained substantial research attention, as it offers potential 
benefits and supports disease treatment. The gut microbiota has a vital role in 
regulating the host's health because it helps in several biological functions, 
such as protection against pathogens, immune function regulation, energy 
harvesting from digested foods, and reinforcement of digestive tract biochemical 
barriers. These functions could be affected by the changes in the gut microbiota 
profile, and gut microbiota differences are associated with several diseases, 
such as inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, irritable bowel disorder, 
mental illness, allergy, and obesity. This review focuses on the digestibility 
of CM components, particularly protein and fat, and their influence on gut 
microbiota modulation. Notably, the hypoallergenic properties and small fat 
globules of CM contribute to its enhanced digestibility. Considering the rapid 
digestion of its proteins under conditions simulating infant gastrointestinal 
digestion, CM exhibits promise as a potential alternative for infant formula 
preparation due to the high β-/αs-casein ratio and protective proteins, in 
addition to the absence of β-lactoglobulin.

Consumers' growing interest in using foods that improve health has motivated 
researchers and the food industry to develop new functional products, such as 
foods containing probiotics or live microbes. Probiotics have functional 
attributes that could satisfy most basic nutritional and therapeutic 
supplementation requirements. These microbes positively respond to clinical 
therapies against diseases and illnesses such as rotavirus-associated diarrhea, 
irritable bowel syndrome, and food allergies. Moreover, the role of probiotics 
in the prevention and treatment of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and diseases 
related to pathogenic microbes is an exciting and rapidly advancing research 
arena. Probiotic supplementation usually involves dairy products. However, 
because of the growing number of individuals affected by lactose intolerance 
and/or vegans, other food matrices like fruits, vegetables, cereals, and so on, 
have been studied as potential carriers for these microorganisms, presenting an 
alternative and better source in the process of assessing novel probiotic 
strains. The present review discusses the various factors affecting the survival 
of probiotics during storage in fruit juices, the possible effect of probiotics 
on sensory attributes and the overall acceptance of the products, and future 
technologies to improve the viability of probiotics.

Flavonoids effectively treat cancer, inflammatory disorders (cardiovascular and 
nervous systems), and oxidative stress. Fisetin, derived from fruits and 
vegetables, suppresses cancer growth by altering cell cycle parameters that lead 
to cell death and angiogenesis without affecting healthy cells. Clinical trials 
are needed in humans to prove the effectiveness of this treatment for a wide 
range of cancers. According to the results of this study, fisetin can be used to 
prevent and treat a variety of cancers. Despite early detection and treatment 
advances, cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. We must take proactive 
steps to reduce the risk of cancer. The natural flavonoid fisetin has 
pharmacological properties that suppress cancer growth. This review focuses on 
the potential drug use of fisetin, which has been extensively explored for its 
cancer-fighting ability and other pharmacological activities such as diabetes, 
COVID-19, obesity, allergy, neurological, and bone disorders. Researchers have 
focused on the molecular function of fisetin. In this review, we have 
highlighted the biological activities against chronic disorders, including 
cancer, metabolic illnesses, and degenerative illnesses, of the dietary 
components of fisetin.

BACKGROUND: An Oesophageal atresia (OA) affects almost 1 in 3500 newborn and its 
aetiology for development between 4th to 6th pregnancy weeks had not yet been 
clarified.
METHODS: This retrospective, observational control group-supported (n = 30) 
examination was performed with OA mothers (n = 20) who were interrogated via 
specialized questionnaires and interviews to evaluate data on medical pregnancy 
history including hormonal treatment, changing of life habits (nutrition, diet, 
medication), drug consumption (alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs) as well as 
exposure to nuclear waste or poisonous substance exposition. Aim was to assess 
risk factors during pregnancy and in particular in the first trimester.
RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI) prior pregnancy of OA mothers was significant 
lower (p = 0.022) and the number of mothers with obesity (BMI>30) did not differ 
to control group mothers (p = 0.081). They had additionally more pre-existing 
illnesses (p = 0.009) and allergies (p = 0.001). Control group mothers changed 
dietary habits with higher meat (p = 0.032) and caffeine intake (p = 0.012) 
compared to OA mothers, which had higher rates of abnormalities during pregnancy 
(p < 0.001) and 38.7% of them suffered of ≥1 abortion in the past. The ethnical 
background of OA mothers was more often German (p < 0.033), while OA fathers had 
a lower socioeconomic status (p = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: Maternal factors like previous abortions, obesity and immunological 
predispositions like existence of allergies combined with increased daily dairy 
consumption influenced obviously the occurrence of OA.

The gut microbiota influences many aspects of the host, including immune system 
maturation, nutrient absorption and metabolism, and protection from pathogens. 
Increasing evidences from cohort and animal studies indicate that changes in the 
gut microbiota early in life increases the risk of developing specific diseases 
early and later in life. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to 
identify specific disease prevention or therapeutic solutions targeting the gut 
microbiota, especially during infancy, which is the window of the human gut 
microbiota establishment process. In this review, we provide an overview of 
current knowledge concerning the relationship between disturbances in the gut 
microbiota early in life and health consequences later in life (e.g., 
necrotizing enterocolitis, celiac disease, asthma, allergies, autism spectrum 
disorders, overweight/obesity, diabetes and growth retardation), with a focus on 
changes in the gut microbiota prior to disease onset. In addition, we summarize 
and discuss potential microbiota-based interventions early in life (e.g., diet 
adjustments, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, 
environmental changes) to promote health or prevent the development of specific 
diseases. This knowledge should aid the understanding of early life microbiology 
and inform the development of prediction and prevention measures for short- and 
long-term health disorders based on the gut microbiota.

The metabolomic profiles of Chinese human milk have been poorly documented. The 
objective of the study was to explore associations between human milk 
metabotypes, maternal adiposity, infant growth patterns, and risk of allergies. 
Two hundred mother−infant dyads from seven cities were randomly selected from 
the Chinese Human Milk Project (CHMP). Untargeted human milk metabolomic 
profiles were determined using HPLC-MS/MS. Two human milk metabotypes were 
identified using principal component analysis. Principal component (PC) 1 was 
characterized by high linoleic acid metabolites with low purine nucleosides and 
metabolites of glutamate and glutathione metabolism. PC 2 was characterized by 
high glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins content. Higher PC1 scores were 
associated with slower infant growth rate and higher ambient temperature (p < 
0.05). Higher PC 2 scores were related to higher maternal BMI and increased risk 
of infant allergies (p < 0.05). Future work is needed to understand the biologic 
mechanisms of these human milk metabotypes.

Observational associations between milk consumption and essential hypertension 
have been reported. However, their causal inferences have not been proven, and 
the effects of different types of milk consumption on hypertension risk remain 
poorly characterized. The Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed 
using public summary-level statistics from genome-wide association studies to 
determine whether the different types of milk consumption affect essential 
hypertension differently. Six different milk consumption types were defined as 
exposure conditions, whereas essential hypertension identified by the ninth and 
tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases was considered 
the outcome of interest. Genetic variants, which were genome-wide associated 
with the types of milk consumed, were used as an instrumental variable for MR 
analysis. In primary MR analysis, the inverse-variance weighted method was 
adopted followed by several sensitivity analyses. Our findings suggested that of 
the 6 common types of milk consumed, semi-skimmed and soya milk products were 
protective against essential hypertension, whereas skim milk had the opposite 
effect. Consistent results were also observed in sensitivity analyses that 
followed. The present study provided genetic evidence that a causal link between 
milk consumption and the risk of essential hypertension and a new reference for 
the diet antihypertensive treatment plan for patients with hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major risk for cardiovascular disease. Several 
studies have connected dairy consumption with lower blood pressure (BP). 
However, these have not considered the Latin American population. The aim of 
this study was to examine the relationship between consumption of full-fat or 
low fat/fat free dairy products and high blood pressure in Chilean adults.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study containing data from 3,807 adults between 20 and 
98 years old from the National Health Survey (NHS) of Chile 2016-2017. 
Information on lifestyle, food frequency, and socio-demographics was collected 
using standardized questionnaires. Trained fieldworkers took anthropometric and 
blood pressure measurements. The frequency of consumption data included seven 
ad-hoc questions on habitual eating and frequency options, based on the 
Mediterranean diet (fish products, fruit and vegetable, and dairy products) and 
its protective effect on cardiovascular diseases. The selection of foods was 
supported by expert opinion.
RESULTS: Of the 3,807 adults, 37% were male and 63% were female. Sex, education 
level, frequency of dairy products and fish, smoking, and sport or physical 
activity had a direct relationship with consumption of dairy products (P < 
0.05). Consumption of low fat/fat free dairy products was protectively 
associated with high blood pressure in the unadjusted model (OR: 0.76, CI 95% 
0.64-0.91). However, after adjustment for confounding variables (education level 
modifies the effect 10.2%), this association was attenuated (OR: 0.88; CI 95% 
0.71-1.08).
CONCLUSION: We found limited evidence that the type of dairy products consumed 
is associated with high blood pressure in the Chilean population.

AIM: To evaluate nutritional patterns in patient with arterial hypertension (AH) 
compared to the control group without elevated blood pressure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective search for unique records of the patients 
aged 1875 y.o. with complete data on usual nutrition with food frequency methods 
who had no mentions of diabetes mellitus, food intolerance or allergies, and 
history of major abdominal surgery, as well as signs of secondary reasons of AH. 
Nutritional patterns were assessed with the use of healthy eating pyramid 
principles. Ststistical analysis was performed with the use of SPSS 13.0 for 
Windows software (SPSS Inc., USA).
RESULTS: The data of 711 patients were available for the final analysis (595 of 
them in AH group). Both groups consumed lower compared to the recommended 
amounts of fruits, dairy and higher amounts of meat. Those with AH consumed 
larger amounts of vegetables (1.130.74 compared to the values of healthy eating 
pyramid vs 0.940.63 in the control group; p=0.004), fruits (0.800.66 vs 
0.520.57; p=0.001), meat (1.851.05 vs 1.620.91; p=0.002) and fats (0.770.60 vs 
0.490.55; p=0.001). On the other hand, there were lower rates of consumption of 
sugars, and confectionaries in the structure of nutritional patterns in patients 
with AH compared to the control group: (0.350.44 of the healthy eating pyramid 
in AH vs 1.930.98, in the control group; p=0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Nutritional patterns of patients with arterial hypertension 
significantly differ compared to the control group. The obtained data may be 
used for diet modification in patients with arterial hypertension.

Publisher: Цель. Изучить структуру (паттерн) питания больных артериальной 
гипертензией (АГ) в сравнении с контрольной группой без повышения артериального 
давления (контрольная группа). Материалы и методы. Проведен ретроспективный 
анализ базы данных системы ПО Нутрилоджик (ООО Нутрилоджик, Россия), в ходе 
которого идентифицированы данные пациентов в возрасте от 18 до 75 лет с 
полностью заполненными и адекватными данными анализа фактического питания 
методом частотного анализа, без признаков вторичной АГ и сопутствующих 
заболеваний, которые могли бы привести к искажению пищевых привычек вследствие 
необходимости специальных ограничений в питании (сахарный диабет, пищевая 
непереносимость, операции на желудочно-кишечном тракте). Оценка структуры 
питания проводилась по частоте и количеству потребления основных групп продуктов 
в сравнении с принципом пирамиды здорового питания. Дополнительный анализ 
проведен в отношении состава подгрупп продуктов. Для математической обработки 
результатов использовался непараметрический модуль ПО SPSS 13.0 for Windows 
(SPSS Inc., USA). Результаты. Конечному анализу доступны данные 711 обследуемых 
(595 в группе АГ). Как для группы АГ, так и контрольной, характерны 
недостаточное потребление фруктов и молочных продуктов, а также избыточное 
потребление мяса. При сравнении групп между собой выявлено, что больные АГ 
потребляли больше овощей (1,130,74 относительно величины пирамиды здорового 
питания против 0,940,63 в группе контроля соответственно; р=0,004), фруктов 
(0,800,66 против 0,520,57; р=0,001), мяса (1,851,05 против 1,620,91; р=0,002) и 
жиров (0,770,60 против 0,490,55; р=0,001). В то же время структура рациона 
больных АГ характеризовалась меньшим относительным количеством сахара и 
кондитерских изделий, чем в группе контроля (0,350,44 относительно показателей 
пирамиды здорового питания в группе АГ против 1,930,98 в группе контроля; 
р=0,0001). Заключение. Структура рациона больных АГ существенно отличается от 
таковой без признаков заболевания. Полученные данные могут быть использованы для 
научно обоснованной модификации рационов у больных АГ.

The most recent scientific evidence supports the consumption of cow's milk and 
dairy products as part of a balanced diet. However, these days, the public and 
practicing physicans are exposed to a stream of inconsistent (and often 
misleading) information regarding the relationship between cow's milk intake and 
health in the lay press and in the media. The purpose of this article, in this 
context, is to facilitate doctor-patient communication on this topic, providing 
physicians with a series of structured answers to frequently asked patient 
questions. The answers range from milk and milk-derived products' nutritional 
function across the life span, to their relationship with diseases such as 
osteoporosis and cancer, to lactose intolerance and milk allergy, and have been 
prepared by a panel of experts from the Italian medical and nutritional 
scientific community. When consumed according to appropriate national 
guidelines, milk and its derivatives contribute essential micro- and 
macronutrients to the diet, especially in infancy and childhood where bone mass 
growth is in a critical phase. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests 
potentially protective effects of milk against overweight, obesity, diabetes, 
and cardiovascular disease, while no clear data suggest a significant 
association between milk intake and cancer. Overall, current scientific 
literature suggests that an appropriate consumption of milk and its derivatives, 
according to available nutritional guidelines, may be beneficial across all age 
groups, with the exception of specific medical conditions such as lactose 
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Key teaching points: Milk and its 
derivatives contribute essential micro and macronutrients to the diet, when 
consumed according to appropriate national guidelines, especially in infancy and 
childhood where bone mass growth is in a critical phase. Preliminary evidence 
suggests potentially protective effects of milk against overweight, obesity, 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease No clear data are available about the 
association between milk intake and cancer. Current scientific literature 
suggests that an appropriate consumption of milk and its derivatives may be 
beneficial at all ages, with the exception of specific medical conditions such 
as lactose intolerance or milk protein allergy.

BACKGROUND: Both systemic redox status and diet quality are associated with risk 
outcomes in chronic disease. It is not known, however, the extent to which diet 
quality influences plasma thiol/disulfide redox status.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of diet, 
as measured by diet quality scores and other dietary factors, on systemic 
thiol/disulfide redox status.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 685 working men and women 
(ages ≥18 y) in Atlanta, GA. Diet was assessed by 3 diet quality scores: the 
Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 
(DASH), and the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS). We measured concentrations of 
plasma glutathione (GSH), cysteine, their associated oxidized forms [glutathione 
disulfide (GSSG) and cystine (CySS), respectively], and their redox potentials 
(EhGSSG and EhCySS) to determine thiol/disulfide redox status. Linear regression 
modeling was performed to assess relations between diet and plasma redox after 
adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), sex, race, and history of chronic 
disease.
RESULTS: MDS was positively associated with plasma GSH (β = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.003, 
0.03) and total GSH (GSH + GSSG) (β = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.03), and inversely 
associated with the CySS:GSH ratio (β = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.04, -0.004). There 
were significant independent associations between individual MDS components 
(dairy, vegetables, fish, and monounsaturated fat intake) and varying plasma 
redox indexes (P < 0.05). AHEI and DASH diet quality indexes and other diet 
factors of interest were not significantly correlated with plasma thiol and 
disulfide redox measures.
CONCLUSION: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was significantly associated 
with a favorable plasma thiol/disulfide redox profile, independent of BMI, in a 
generally healthy working adult population. Although longitudinal studies are 
warranted, these findings contribute to the feasibility of targeting a 
Mediterranean diet to improve plasma redox status.

Objective To prospectively examine the relation between the Dietary Approaches 
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Western diets and risk of gout (ie, the clinical 
endpoint of hyperuricemia) in men.Design Prospective cohort study.Setting The 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study.Participants 44 444 men with no history of 
gout at baseline. Using validated food frequency questionnaires, each 
participant was assigned a DASH dietary pattern score (based on high intake of 
fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low fat dairy products, and whole grains, 
and low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats) and 
a Western dietary pattern score (based on high intake of red and processed 
meats, French fries, refined grains, sweets, and desserts).Main outcome 
measure Risk of incident gout meeting the preliminary American College of 
Rheumatology survey criteria for gout, adjusting for potential confounders, 
including age, body mass index, hypertension, diuretic use, and alcohol 
intake.Results During 26 years of follow-up, 1731 confirmed cases of incident 
gout were documented. A higher DASH dietary pattern score was associated with a 
lower risk for gout (adjusted relative risk for extreme fifths 0.68, 95% 
confidence interval 0.57 to 0.80, P value for trend <0.001). In contrast, a 
higher Western dietary pattern score was associated with an increased risk for 
gout (1.42, 1.16 to 1.74, P=0.005).Conclusion The DASH diet is associated with a 
lower risk of gout, suggesting that its effect of lowering uric acid levels in 
individuals with hyperuricemia translates to a lower risk of gout. Conversely, 
the Western diet is associated with a higher risk of gout. The DASH diet may 
provide an attractive preventive dietary approach for men at risk of gout.

The structural and allergenic modifications of tropomyosin Tod p1 (TMTp1) in 
fresh squids induced by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) were investigated. The 
α-helix in TMTp1 decreased along with increasing pressure from 200 to 600 MPa, 
where almost 53% α-helix was converted into β-sheet and random coils at 600 MPa. 
The free sulfhydryl group dropped significantly as pressure went up, but the 
surface hydrophobicity increased at 200 and 400 MPa, while it slightly decreased 
at 600 MPa. Based on in vitro gastrointestinal digestion test, digestibility of 
TMTp1 was promoted by HHP treatment, in which 400 and 600 MPa were more 
effective in reducing the allergenicity than 200 MPa based on indirect ELISA. 
This study suggested that HHP can decrease allergenicity of TMTp1 by protein 
unfolding and secondary structure modification, thus providing potential for 
alleviating allergenicity of squid.

Cow's milk and goat's milk.

Turck D(1).

Pediatrics, Jeanne de Flandre Children's Hospital, Lille University Faculty of 
Medicine, INSERM U995, Lille, France.

Cow's milk is increasingly suggested to play a role in the development of 
chronic degenerative, non-communicable disorders whereas goat's milk is 
advocated as having several health benefits. Cow's milk is a rich and cheap 
source of protein and calcium, and a valuable food for bone health. Despite 
their high content in saturated fats, consumption of full-fat dairy products 
does not seem to cause significant changes in cardiovascular disease risk 
variables. Early introduction of cow's milk is a strong negative determinant of 
iron status. Unmodified cow's milk does not meet nutritional requirements of 
infants although it is acceptable to add small volumes of cow's milk to 
complementary foods. Cow's milk protein allergy has a prevalence ranging from 2 
to 7%, and the age of recovery is usually around 2-3 years. The evidence linking 
cow's milk intake to a later risk of type 1 diabetes or chronic degenerative, 
non-communicable disorders (obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension) is not convincing. Milk probably protects against colorectal 
cancer, diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer, and there 
is limited evidence suggesting that high consumption of milk and dairy products 
increases the risk for prostate cancer. There is no evidence to support the use 
of a cow's milk-free diet as a primary treatment for individuals with autistic 
spectrum disorders. Unmodified goat's milk is not suitable for infants because 
of the high protein and minerals content and of a low folate content. Goat's 
milk has no clear nutritional advantage over cow's milk and is not less 
allergenic. The European Food Safety Authority recently stated that proteins 
from goat's milk can be suitable as a protein source for infant and follow-on 
formula, provided the final product complies with the compositional criteria 
laid down in Directive 2006/141/EC.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: It has been postulated that a higher dairy consumption 
may affect blood pressure regulation. The aim of this study was to examine the 
association between dairy consumption and blood pressure in mid-childhood.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Subjects (n = 335) were participants of a birth cohort at high 
risk of asthma with information on diet at 18 months and blood pressure at 8 
years. Multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of dairy 
consumption (serves) and micronutrient intakes (mg). In a subgroup of children 
(n = 201), dietary intake was also measured at approximately 9 years.
RESULTS: Children in the highest quintile of dairy consumption at 18 months had 
lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at 8 
years (2.5 mm Hg, P=0.046 and 1.9 mm Hg, P = 0.047, respectively) than those in 
the lowest quintiles. SBP was lowest among children in the highest quintiles of 
calcium, magnesium and potassium intakes. Significant negative linear trends 
were observed between SBP and intakes of dairy serves, calcium, magnesium and 
potassium. Furthermore, SBP and DBP were lowest in the group of children that 
consumed at least two dairy serves at both 18 months and the follow-up dietary 
data collection at 9 years, compared with all other children (SBP 98.7 vs 101.0 
mm Hg, P = 0.07; and DBP 56.5 vs 59.3 mm Hg, P = 0.006, respectively).
CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a protective effect of dairy 
consumption in childhood on blood pressure at age 8 years.

Prospective trials have shown an independent negative correlation between dairy 
food consumption and overweight, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and 
ischaemic cardiovascular diseases. Large amounts of calcium can reduce 
intestinal fat absorption. They can also reduce lipogenesis, through an 
inhibitory effect on calcium calcitriol-mediated intracellular fluxes. Some 
soluble aminoacids appear to reduce appetite and may also improve tissular 
insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, arterial pressure and cardiovascular 
morbidity. Milk and dairy foods are recommended for patients with obesity, 
diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome, and also for patients at risk. 
The high quality and low price of dairy proteins must be underlined. Controversy 
surrounding the possible atherogenic effect of dairy fatty acids means that 
fat-free milk and other dairy foods without added sugar should be preferred. 
Contraindications include lactose maltolerance and milk protein allergy.

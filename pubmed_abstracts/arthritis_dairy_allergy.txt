IMPORTANCE: Plant-based diets are increasing in popularity due, in part, to 
their health benefits for selected cardiometabolic diseases as well as favorable 
environmental impact. Little is known about how such a diet is related to gout 
risk.
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between adherence to a plant-based diet 
(including healthy and unhealthy versions of this diet), as well as its 18 
individual food groups, and incident gout.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study used data from 
population-based cohorts of US men and women enrolled in the Health 
Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2012) and Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010). 
Participants were men and women free of gout at baseline. Statistical analyses 
were performed over March 2020 to August 2023.
EXPOSURES: An overall plant-based diet index (PDI), as well as healthy (hPDI) 
and unhealthy (uPDI) versions of this index that emphasize healthy and less 
healthy plant-based foods, respectively. These diet indices were comprised of 18 
food groups, assessed using a validated semiquantitative food frequency 
questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident cases of gout that were confirmed with a 
supplementary questionnaire to meet the preliminary American College of 
Rheumatology survey criteria for gout. Cox proportional hazards regression 
models were used to evaluate multivariable-adjusted associations of all 3 PDIs 
with incident gout using quintiles (Q) of adherence.
RESULTS: Among a total of 122 679 participants (mean [SD] age, 53.8 [9.8] years 
among 43 703 men; mean [SD] age, 50.9 [7.2] years among 78 976 women) over 
2 704 899 person-years of follow-up, 2709 participants experienced incident 
gout. The overall PDI was not significantly associated with gout in either 
cohort (Q5 vs Q1 pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 [95% CI, 0.89-1.17]; P for 
trend = .63). In the pooled analysis, hPDI was significantly inversely 
associated with risk of gout (Q5 vs Q1 HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]; P for 
trend = .002), while the uPDI was positively associated with risk of gout (Q5 vs 
Q1 HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.03-1.33]; P for trend = .02), particularly in women (Q5 
vs Q1 HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.05-1.62]; P for trend = .01). In analysis of 
individual food groups, higher intakes of certain healthy plant foods, such as 
whole grains (pooled HR per 1 serving/d, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89-0.97]) and tea and 
coffee (pooled HR per 1 serving/d, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.97]), as well as dairy 
(pooled HR per 1 serving/d, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.82-0.90]), were independently 
associated with a lower risk of gout, while selected unhealthy plant foods, such 
as fruit juice (pooled HR per 1 serving/d, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.00-1.13]) and 
sugar-sweetened beverages (pooled HR per 1 serving/d, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.07-1.26]) 
were associated with increased risk of gout.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this prospective cohort study of PDIs 
and gout support current dietary recommendations to increase consumption of 
healthy plant foods while lowering intake of unhealthy plant foods to mitigate 
gout risk.

IMPORTANCE: An estimated 7.6% of children and 10.8% of adults have IgE-mediated 
food-protein allergies in the US. IgE-mediated food allergies may cause 
anaphylaxis and death. A delayed, IgE-mediated allergic response to the 
food-carbohydrate galactose-α-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) in mammalian meat 
affects an estimated 96 000 to 450 000 individuals in the US and is currently a 
leading cause of food-related anaphylaxis in adults.
OBSERVATIONS: In the US, 9 foods account for more than 90% of IgE-mediated food 
allergies-crustacean shellfish, dairy, peanut, tree nuts, fin fish, egg, wheat, 
soy, and sesame. Peanut is the leading food-related cause of fatal and 
near-fatal anaphylaxis in the US, followed by tree nuts and shellfish. The 
fatality rate from anaphylaxis due to food in the US is estimated to be 0.04 per 
million per year. Alpha-gal syndrome, which is associated with tick bites, is a 
rising cause of IgE-mediated food anaphylaxis. The seroprevalence of 
sensitization to alpha-gal ranges from 20% to 31% in the southeastern US. 
Self-injectable epinephrine is the first-line treatment for food-related 
anaphylaxis. The cornerstone of IgE-food allergy management is avoidance of the 
culprit food allergen. There are emerging immunotherapies to desensitize to one 
or more foods, with one current US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral 
immunotherapy product for treatment of peanut allergy.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: IgE-mediated food allergies, including delayed 
IgE-mediated allergic responses to red meat in alpha-gal syndrome, are common in 
the US, and may cause anaphylaxis and rarely, death. IgE-mediated anaphylaxis to 
food requires prompt treatment with epinephrine injection. Both food-protein 
allergy and alpha-gal syndrome management require avoiding allergenic foods, 
whereas alpha-gal syndrome also requires avoiding tick bites.

Studies linking type of diet and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) have 
variable results and are inconsistent. This case shows an evolution which 
fulfilled the criteria of JIA, but was diagnosed as food allergy. Case: A 
seven-year old boy had fever, arthralgia, general malaise, headaches, abdominal 
pain and rashes. These symptoms were diagnosed as fever of unknown origin (FUO) 
and probable JIA. There was a stabbing pain in the right iliac fossa. An upper 
and lower endoscopy were performed and nodular ileocolitis was detected. A 
hypoallergenic diet was prescribed, in addition to mesalazine and oral 
corticosteroids. The patient was asymptomatic for 2.5 months and then relapsed 
with all symptoms after consuming dairy. This JIA case shows the diagnostic 
phases of food allergy: improvement and recurrence of symptoms with the 
reintroduction of the allergen (oral challenge=gold standard of food allergy). 
There is evidence that supports the existence of a gut-joint axis, where the 
luminal content triggers a series of immunologically mediated reactions that can 
cause systemic diseases such as J other connective tissue diseases. This case 
report adds reasonable evidence in support of food allergy as a cause of JIA.

BACKGROUND: There is strong evidence of under-reporting of harms in manuscripts 
on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared with the volume of raw data 
retrieved from these trials. Many guidelines have been developed to tackle this, 
but they have failed to address some important issues that would allow for 
standardization and transparency. As a consequence, harms reporting in 
manuscripts remains suboptimal.
OBJECTIVE: The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of 
Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) aimed to 
deliver accurate recommendations for better reporting of harms in clinical 
trials manuscripts on anti-osteoarthritis (OA) drugs. These could help to better 
inform clinicians on harms recorded in RCTs and further help researchers 
conducting meta-analyses.
METHODS: Using the outcomes of several systematic reviews on the safety of 
anti-OA drugs, we summarized the ways in which harms have been reported in OA 
RCT manuscripts to date. Next, we drafted some recommendations and initiated a 
modified Delphi process that involved a panel of clinicians and clinical 
researchers to build an expert consensus on recommendations from the ESCEO for 
the reporting of harms in future manuscripts on RCTs assessing anti-OA drugs.
RESULTS: These recommendations emphasize that all treatment-emergent adverse 
events (AEs) should always be taken into account for harms reporting, with no 
frequency threshold, and describe how specific AEs should be reported; they also 
provide a list of the most relevant organ systems to be considered according to 
each class of drug for reporting of harms within the results section of a 
manuscript. Irrespective of the drug, the ESCEO recommends that total, severe 
and serious AEs and withdrawals due to AEs should always be reported; guidance 
on the reporting of specific events pertaining to each category is provided. The 
ESCEO also recommends the reporting of information on drug effect on biological 
parameters, with specific guidance.
CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations may contribute to improve transparency in the 
field of safety of anti-OA medications. Pharmaceutical companies developing 
drugs for OA, and researchers conducting clinical trials, are encouraged to 
comply with them when reporting harms-related results in manuscripts on RCTs. 
The ESCEO also encourages journals to refer to the ESCEO recommendations in 
their instructions to authors for the publication of manuscripts on trials of 
anti-OA medications.

BACKGROUND: Some controversy exists regarding the safety of intra-articular 
hyaluronic acid (IAHA) in the management of osteoarthritis (OA).
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to re-assess the safety profile of 
IAHA in patients with OA, through a comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized, 
placebo-controlled trials.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the databases 
MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus. 
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that 
assessed adverse events (AEs) with IAHA in patients with OA were eligible for 
inclusion. Authors and/or study sponsors were contacted to obtain the full 
report of AEs. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well 
as the following MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)-related AEs: gastrointestinal, 
cardiac, vascular, respiratory, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, musculoskeletal, renal and urinary disorders, infections and 
infestations, and hypersensitivity reaction.
RESULTS: Database searches initially identified 1481 records. After exclusions 
according to the selection criteria, 22 studies were included in the qualitative 
synthesis, and nine studies having adequate data were ultimately included in the 
meta-analysis. From the studies excluded according to the pre-specified 
selection criteria, 21 with other pharmacological OA treatments permitted during 
the trials were a posteriori included in a parallel qualitative synthesis, from 
which eight studies with adequate data were finally included in a parallel 
meta-analysis. Since this meta-analysis was designed to assess safety, the 
exclusion criterion on concomitant anti-OA medication was crucial. However, due 
to the high number of studies that allowed mainly concomitant oral non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we decided to include them in a post hoc 
parallel analysis in order to compare the results from the two analyses. No 
statistically significant difference in odds was found between IAHA and placebo 
for all types of SOC-related disorders, except for infections and infestations, 
for which significantly lower odds were found with IAHA compared with placebo, 
both overall (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.93; 
I2 = 0%) and in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 0.49, 95% 
CI 0.27-0.89). There were significant increased odds of reporting serious AEs 
with IAHA compared with placebo, both overall (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.21-2.63; 
I2 = 0%) and in studies with concomitant anti-OA medication (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 
1.10-2.89), but not in studies without concomitant anti-OA medication 
(OR = 1.78, 95% CI 0.92-3.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Using the available data on studies without any concomitant anti-OA 
medication permitted during clinical trials, IAHA seems not to be associated 
with any safety issue in the management of OA. However, this evidence was 
associated with only a "low" to "moderate" certainty. A possible association 
with increased risk of serious AEs, particularly when used with concomitant OA 
medications, requires further investigation.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) (Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple 
sclerosis) are diseases of the immune system that have some shared genetic and 
environmental predisposing factors, but still few studies have investigated the 
effects of lifestyle on disease risk of several CIDs. The primary aim of this 
prospective cohort study is to investigate the impact of fibre, red meat and 
processed meat on risk of late-onset CID, with the perspective that results of 
this study can contribute in supporting future diet recommendations for 
effective personalised prevention.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will use data from 57 053 persons from the 
prospective Danish cohort study 'Diet, Cancer and Health' together with National 
Health Registry data. The follow-up period is from December 1993 to December 
2018. Questionnaire data on diet and lifestyle were collected at entry to the 
Diet, Cancer and Health study. The outcome CID is defined as having a diagnosis 
of one of the CIDs registered in the National Patient Registry or, for multiple 
sclerosis, in the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Registry during follow-up and being 
treated with a drug used for the specific disease. The major outcome of the 
analyses will be to detect variability in risk of late onset of any CID and, if 
power allows, disease risk of late onset of each CID diagnosis between persons 
with different fibre and red meat, and processed meat intake. The outcome will 
be adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, energy, alcohol, 
fermented dairy products, education, smoking status, hormone replacement therapy 
and comorbidity.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection 
Agency (2012-58-0018). The core study is an open register-based cohort study. 
The study does not need approval from the Ethics committee or Institutional 
Review Board by Danish law. Study findings will be disseminated through 
peer-reviewed journals, patient associations and presentations at international 
conferences.

Objective To prospectively examine the relation between the Dietary Approaches 
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and Western diets and risk of gout (ie, the clinical 
endpoint of hyperuricemia) in men.Design Prospective cohort study.Setting The 
Health Professionals Follow-up Study.Participants 44 444 men with no history of 
gout at baseline. Using validated food frequency questionnaires, each 
participant was assigned a DASH dietary pattern score (based on high intake of 
fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes, low fat dairy products, and whole grains, 
and low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats) and 
a Western dietary pattern score (based on high intake of red and processed 
meats, French fries, refined grains, sweets, and desserts).Main outcome 
measure Risk of incident gout meeting the preliminary American College of 
Rheumatology survey criteria for gout, adjusting for potential confounders, 
including age, body mass index, hypertension, diuretic use, and alcohol 
intake.Results During 26 years of follow-up, 1731 confirmed cases of incident 
gout were documented. A higher DASH dietary pattern score was associated with a 
lower risk for gout (adjusted relative risk for extreme fifths 0.68, 95% 
confidence interval 0.57 to 0.80, P value for trend <0.001). In contrast, a 
higher Western dietary pattern score was associated with an increased risk for 
gout (1.42, 1.16 to 1.74, P=0.005).Conclusion The DASH diet is associated with a 
lower risk of gout, suggesting that its effect of lowering uric acid levels in 
individuals with hyperuricemia translates to a lower risk of gout. Conversely, 
the Western diet is associated with a higher risk of gout. The DASH diet may 
provide an attractive preventive dietary approach for men at risk of gout.

OBJECTIVES: A dietary link to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been suspected and 
an influence on arthritic symptoms by different diets has been reported. Our 
primary aim was to record the self-experienced adverse food reactions in 
patients with RA. A secondary aim was to relate self-experienced adverse 
reactions to dairy produce and wheat to the local mucosal reactivity observed 
after rectal challenge with cow's milk protein (CM) and wheat gluten.
METHODS: A questionnaire about self-experienced adverse reaction to food was 
sent to 347 RA patients. Rectal challenge with CM and gluten was performed in 27 
of these patients and in healthy controls (n = 18). After a 15-h challenge the 
mucosal production of nitric oxide (NO) and the mucosal release of 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were measured by 
using the mucosal patch technique.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven per cent of the RA patients reported food intolerance (FI) 
to various foods, and in particular to CM, meat, and wheat gluten. Strong 
mucosal reactivity to CM was observed in 11% of the patients. Moderately 
increased mucosal reactivity to CM and gluten was found in 22% and 33%, 
respectively, of the patients. No relationship was found between 
self-experienced adverse reactions to CM or gluten and mucosal reactivity to 
these proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived FI is reported frequently by RA patients, with a 
prevalence similar to that reported previously in the general population. 
Mucosal reactivity to CM and gluten is seen in a minor fraction of RA patients 
and is not related to the frequently perceived intolerance to these proteins.

Intolerance to certain foods can cause a range of gut and systemic symptoms. The 
possibility that these can be caused by lactose has been missed because of 
"hidden" lactose added to many foods and drinks inadequately labelled, confusing 
diagnosis based on dietary removal of dairy foods. Two polymorphisms, C/T13910 
and G/A22018, linked to hypolactasia, correlate with breath hydrogen and 
symptoms after lactose. This, with a 48 hour record of gut and systemic symptoms 
and a six hour breath hydrogen test, provides a new approach to the clinical 
management of lactose intolerance. The key is the prolonged effect of dietary 
removal of lactose. Patients diagnosed as lactose intolerant must be advised of 
"risk" foods, inadequately labelled, including processed meats, bread, cake 
mixes, soft drinks, and lagers. This review highlights the wide range of 
systemic symptoms caused by lactose intolerance. This has important implications 
for the management of irritable bowel syndrome, and for doctors of many 
specialties.

Management of patients using unproven regimens for arthritis.

Wolman PG.

Such treatments as vegetarian diets, fresh or raw diets, allergy diets, 
no-dairy-products diets, fasting, vitamin and mineral supplementation, apple 
cider vinegar, and honey drinks are touted in the popular press as effective for 
the treatment of arthritis. In contrast to conventional therapies, the unproven 
treatments promise not only relief from symptoms but freedom from the disease as 
long as the diet regimen is followed. Several of the remedies appear to be 
harmless, but others are dangerous, especially if followed for prolonged 
periods. Nutrition professionals should be aware of the nature of these 
treatments and be prepared to offer sound, scientifically based but 
nonjudgmental care and information.

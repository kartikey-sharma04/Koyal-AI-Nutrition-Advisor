Immune-mediated food allergy and non-immune mediated food intolerance are 
categorized as the most common adverse reactions resulting from the ingestion of 
certain foods. As there is no standard treatment, the possible remedy to avoid 
exposure to these adverse reactions is adhering to a strict diet that eliminates 
allergic and intolerant foods. The commonly consumed foods including dairy 
products, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanut, soybean, and wheat-based 
products are proven to cause food allergy. Foods containing lactose, gluten, 
high FODMAPs, biogenic amines, and certain food additives leads to potential 
health risks in intolerant individuals. Besides, there are various foods whose 
mechanism of action in triggering food allergy and intolerance is yet to be 
defined. However, the public in-depth understanding of natural foods, processed 
foods, and packaged food products that induce allergic reactions and intolerance 
remains low. Therefore, awareness of diet that partially or completely excludes 
the intake of certain foods associated with these reactions should be widespread 
among the consumers.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy is a substantial health burden, which 
disproportionately affects children. Among children with food allergy, as many 
as 70% have multiple food allergies. Whereas the overall burden of food allergy 
on quality of life has been described, little is known about the burden of 
individual allergens. We aimed to examine the perception of burden among 
families with multiple food-allergic children.
METHODS: Parents of children with 1 + children with multiple food allergies 
including milk responded to online questions, including both open-ended and 
closed-ended questions on food allergy-related burdens of time, financial costs, 
social restrictions, and emotional demands.
RESULTS: Overall, 64 children (69.8% boys) of whom (73.0%) most were aged 10 and 
younger were included. Most had been diagnosed with food allergy in infancy and 
by a (pediatric) allergist. Other common allergies included peanut (65.6%), tree 
nuts (57.8%), egg (76.6%), and sesame (31.3%). Quantitatively, milk allergy was 
reported as carrying the most burden, including most socially limiting (81.5%), 
requiring the most planning (75.9%), causing the most anxiety (68.5%), most 
challenging to find "safe" or allergy-friendly foods (72.2%), and costly 
(81.5%). Qualitatively, we identified five themes that captured burdens 
associated with costs, marketing of milk products to children, risk of 
cross-contamination, ubiquity of milk/dairy and public confusion with lactose 
intolerance, and an unwillingness of others to accommodate the allergy.
CONCLUSION: Parents whose children have multiple food allergies, including milk, 
report milk as the allergy associated with the greatest time, financial, social, 
and emotional burdens.

Food allergies are immune-mediated allergic adverse reactions that occur after 
exposure to specific foods. The most commonly recognized food allergies are 
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions (eg, urticaria, angioedema, 
anaphylaxis) that result from exposure to milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, 
shellfish, fish, wheat, or soy. However, other foods can cause food allergies. 
Oral allergy syndrome is a common but underrecognized condition characterized by 
transient oropharyngeal symptoms that result from ingestion of uncooked fruits 
or vegetables. Non-IgE-mediated food allergies manifest with more delayed 
symptoms than IgE-mediated food allergies, and predominately cause 
gastrointestinal symptoms. Food allergies often are overreported because they 
may be confused with food intolerances or nonimmunologic adverse food reactions 
(eg, lactose intolerance, food poisoning, caffeine intolerance). Food allergies 
are diagnosed using IgE skin tests, IgE serum tests, or oral food challenge 
tests. These allergies are best managed by avoidance of the food or foods 
related to the allergy because they require ingestion rather than contact to 
precipitate symptoms. Injectable epinephrine should be prescribed for patients 
at risk of anaphylaxis. Careful food label reading and food preparation, 
awareness, and education are keys to prevention.

[A global vision of adverse reactions to foods: food allergy and food 
intolerance].

Over the last years, there has been an increase in adverse food reactions, 
probably associated with life style changes in the past decades. An adverse food 
reaction is any clinically abnormal response that can be attributed to 
ingestion, contact or inhalation of a food, its derivatives or an additive 
contained in it. They can be classified as food allergy or intolerance. Food 
allergies are usually immune-mediated, associated with IgE. Adverse reactions to 
food have a large clinical and social repercussion, which can be fatal in some 
cases and impair the quality of life of patients. This implies directly the 
services of collective catering and food manufacturing, which is why a 
legislature and regulations were implemented for its correct management. The 
most allergenic foods change according to the age group; being the egg the most 
frequent in children under 5 years, and fresh fruits in the older than 5 years. 
The most frequent clinical manifestations are cutaneous-mucous type. Food 
intolerances may be due to a pharmacological, metabolic, mixed or idiosyncratic 
mechanism. Clinical manifestations are usually dose dependent. The most common 
and known food intolerance is lactose, which is a metabolic type. The main 
treatment of both types of adverse reaction to foods is avoidance of the causal 
food of the reaction.

Publisher: En estos últimos años se ha evidenciado un aumento de las reacciones 
adversas a alimentos, probablemente asociadas a los cambios en el estilo de vida 
producidos en las últimas décadas. Una reacción adversa a alimentos es cualquier 
respuesta clínicamente anormal que puede atribuirse a la ingestión, contacto o 
inhalación de un alimento, de sus derivados o de uno de sus aditivos.Pueden 
clasificarse en alergia o intolerancia alimentaria. Las alergias alimentarias 
suelen tener un componente inmunológico generalmente asociado a inmunoglobulina 
E (IgE). Las reacciones adversas a alimentos tienen una gran repercusión tanto 
clínica como social y perjudican la calidad de vida de los pacientes y, en 
algunos casos, resultan fatales, de ahí que se implique directamente a los 
servicios de restauración colectiva y de manufacturación de alimentos para su 
correcto manejo.Los alimentos más alérgenos cambian según el grupo etario. La 
alergia al huevo es la más frecuente en menores de 5 años y a las frutas 
frescas, en los mayores de 5 años. Las manifestaciones clínicas más frecuentes 
son de tipo cutáneo-mucosas. Las intolerancias alimentarias pueden deberse a un 
mecanismo farmacológico, metabólico, mixto o idiosincrático, pero no 
inmunológico. Las manifestaciones clínicas suelen ser dosis dependientes, 
mientras que las alérgicas son dosis independientes.La intolerancia alimentaria 
más frecuente y conocida es la intolerancia a la lactosa, que es de tipo 
metabólica. El tratamiento principal para ambos tipos de reacciones adversas a 
alimentos consiste en evitar el alimento que causa de la reacción.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of food allergies 
and intolerances among children in preschools in Reykjavik, Iceland. Also, to 
investigate how well preschools maintain a safe environment for children with 
food allergies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2014, a questionnaire designed specifically for this 
study, was sent to 65 preschools. Forty-nine participated (75%) representing a 
total of 4225 children. Prevalence of food allergy and intolerance was 
determined based on medical certificates from physi-cians delivered to the 
preschools. Descriptive statistics were used to assess whether there were 
protocols related to food allergy, and if there was a difference between schools 
based on staff's education and number of children.
RESULTS: The prevalence of documented food allergies/intolerances in children 
aged 2-6 years was 5%, 1% had severe allergy and 1% had multiple food allergies. 
Lactose intolerance was most frequent (2%), then milk allergy (2%) and egg 
allergy (1%). Only 41% preschools had a protocol that was activated if food with 
an allergen was accidentally given. Moreover, only 55% of preschools with 
children with severe -allergy reported all of their staff to have knowledge of 
symptoms related to anaphylaxis and only 64% were trained to respond to an 
anaphylactic shock. The education of preschool principals, kitchen employees and 
number of children in preschool were not related to having an active protocol at 
site.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of food allergy and intolerance was 5% in preschools in 
Reykjavik. Strategy for an active protocol related to food allergy was lacking 
in 59% of pre-schools.

BACKGROUND: While Health Related Quality of Life has been investigated among 
children with IgE-mediated food allergy, less is known about quality of life 
among children with other types of hypersensitivity to food. The aim of this 
study was to investigate Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) in children with 
and without food hypersensitivity. Further, we compared HRQL between children 
with different phenotypes of food hypersensitivity.
METHODS: In a large population-based cohort of schoolchildren in Northern 
Sweden, the parents of 2612 (96% of invited) completed a questionnaire. All 125 
(5%) children who reported complete elimination of milk, egg, fish or wheat due 
to food hypersensitivity were invited to a clinical examination and 94 children 
participated. Of these, 75 children also completed a generic (KIDSCREEN-52) and 
a disease-specific HRQL questionnaire (FAQLQ-TF). Thereafter, these children 
were categorised into the different phenotypes: current food allergy, outgrown 
food allergy, and lactose intolerance. Additionally, 209 children with 
unrestricted diets answered the generic questionnaire.
RESULTS: The median score of all KIDSCREEN-52 domains were above the population 
norm of 50 both in children with and without food hypersensitivity. No 
significant differences in distribution in generic or disease-specific HRQL were 
found between children with or without food hypersensitivity. There were no 
significant differences in HRQL between children with different phenotypes of 
food hypersensitivity. However, children with current food allergy tended to 
have the lowest HRQL. Further, poor HRQL defined as ≥75th percentile for the 
disease specific score was significantly more common in the current food allergy 
phenotype in the domain Emotional impact and the total FAQLQ, compared to the 
other phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, 12-13 year old children reported 
good HRQL regardless of having food hypersensitivity or not. However, the 
children with the current phenotype reported lower HRQL than the other 
phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric campers with food allergies are at greater risk for 
exposure and anaphylaxis. A diagnosis of asthma increases risk for anaphylaxis. 
Epidemiological investigations of food-allergic children at high risk for 
allergic reactions requiring intervention in camp settings are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of food 
allergies among otherwise healthy campers in summer camps throughout the United 
States and Canada, and to assess asthma comorbidity and determine rates of 
epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions present in this population.
METHODS: We partnered with CampDoc.com, a web-based camp electronic health 
record system. Deidentified data were abstracted from 170 camps representing 
122,424 campers. Only food allergies with a parental report of symptoms 
requiring intervention or with a camp prescription for an epinephrine 
autoinjector were included, whereas gluten, lactose intolerance, and food dyes 
were excluded. Asthma status and epinephrine presence on the camp medication 
list were assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, 2.5% of campers (n = 3055) had documented food allergies. Of 
these campers, 22% had multiple food allergies. Median age was 11 years; 52% 
were female. Nuts (81%), seafood (17.4%), egg (8.5%), fruit (8.1%), and seeds 
(7.2%) were the top 5 food allergies reported. Of food-allergic campers, 44.3% 
had concurrent asthma and 34.7% of those campers were taking multiple asthma 
medications. Less than half (39.7%) of food-allergic children brought an 
epinephrine autoinjector to the camp.
CONCLUSIONS: Life-saving epinephrine is not necessarily available for 
food-allergic children in camp settings. A substantial proportion of 
food-allergic campers are at higher risk for anaphylaxis based on concurrent 
asthma status.

Immunologically mediated hypersensitivity to foods is defined as food allergy, 
mainly due to immunglobulins of class E (IgE) triggering immediate reactions 
(type I hypersensitivity) with possible involvement of mucosa, skin, airways, 
intestinal tract, and the vascular system. Primary food allergy is based on 
(early) IgE sensitization against animal (e. g., cow's milk, hen's eggs) or 
plant proteins (e. g. peanut, hazelnut or wheat). In the case of secondary food 
allergies, IgE against pollen proteins (e. g., birch) reacts to structurally 
related food proteins (with cross-reactions to stone and pit fruits). 
Non-immunological food intolerance reactions are mostly based on carbohydrate 
malassimilation (e. g., lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption) and are 
rarely due to pseudo-allergies (e. g., flavors, dyes, preservatives) primarily 
in patients with chronic urticaria. Common intestinal symptoms are mainly due to 
functional disorders (e. g., irritable bowel disease), rarely because of 
inflammatory intestinal diseases (e. g., celiac disease). Histamine intolerance, 
gluten hypersensitivity, and so-called food type III hypersensitivities are 
controversial diagnoses. The aforementioned disease entities/models are of 
variable importance for the affected individuals, the public health system, and 
society in general.

OBJECTIVES: Knowledge about the prevalence of allergies to foods in childhood 
and adolescence is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
prevalence of allergies to milk, egg, cod, and wheat using reported data, 
clinical examinations, and double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges, and 
to describe the phenotypes of reported food hypersensitivity in a cohort of 
Swedish schoolchildren.
METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 12-year-old children, the parents of 
2612 (96% of invited) completed a questionnaire. Specific IgE antibodies to 
foods were analyzed in a random sample (n=695). Children reporting complete 
avoidance of milk, egg, cod, or wheat due to perceived hypersensitivity and 
without physician-diagnosed celiac disease were invited to undergo clinical 
examination that included specific IgE testing, a celiac screening test, and 
categorization into phenotypes of food hypersensitivity according to preset 
criteria. Children with possible food allergy were further evaluated with 
double-blind challenges.
RESULTS: In this cohort, the prevalence of reported food allergy to milk, egg, 
cod, or wheat was 4.8%. Food allergy was diagnosed in 1.4% of the children after 
clinical evaluation and in 0.6% following double-blind placebo-controlled food 
challenge. After clinical examination, children who completely avoided one or 
more essential foods due to perceived food hypersensitivity were categorized 
with the following phenotypes: allergy (29%), outgrown allergy (19%), lactose 
intolerance (40%), and unclear (12%).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a high discrepancy in the prevalence of allergy to milk, 
egg, cod and wheat as assessed by reported data, clinical evaluation, and 
double-blind food challenges. Food hypersensitivity phenotyping according to 
preset criteria was helpful for identifying children with food allergy.

INTRODUCTION: Shellfish processing workers are highly susceptible to respiratory 
illnesses such as allergies and asthma. This study examined respiratory symptoms 
and biomarkers of allergy and asthma in Norwegian shrimp processing plant 
workers and evaluated allergenic and irritant protein exposures in the 
workplace.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 35 shrimp processing workers and 21 
controls. Respiratory symptoms were assessed via questionnaire; blood samples 
were analysed for allergy and asthma biomarkers and specific IgE levels. Air 
samples were analysed for protein levels and composition.
RESULTS: Shrimp processing workers had four to five times higher odds of 
reporting acute upper and chronic lower respiratory symptoms than the controls. 
They also had significantly higher plasma levels of IL4, CCL20, CSF2 and MMP12, 
with 11% of the exposed workers showing elevated levels of shrimp and crab 
specific IgE. Furthermore, exposed workers showed increased plasma levels of 
SFTPD and CHI3L1 post-shift. The median total protein exposure was 6 µg/m3, with 
peaks up to 66 µg/m3 in the cooking and peeling department. Total protein levels 
were correlated with CCL20, IL13, and basophil counts. Ninety-five shrimp 
proteins were identified, including seven known and eight potential allergens. 
Tropomyosin levels were generally high, particularly in the cooking and peeling 
department.
CONCLUSION: Shrimp workers had a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and 
biomarkers of allergy and asthma. The work environment contained tropomyosin and 
other allergenic proteins as well as irritants, highlighting the need for 
protective measures, especially in the cooking and peeling departments.

BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) 
addendum guidelines for primary prevention of peanut allergy1 provide 
recommendations regarding peanut introduction, and a recent consensus statement 
highlighted the importance of timely introduction of other commonly allergenic 
solids, and the role of family history as a risk factor.2ObjectiveTo determine 
whether children in households with a food allergic parent/caregiver or sibling 
have different rates of being fed commonly allergenic solids during the first 
year of life than children lacking this family history.
METHODS: A pretested survey was administered between January-February 2021 to a 
U.S. sample of 3,062 parents/caregivers of children born since the NIAID 
Addendum guidelines. Survey-weighted chi-square statistics and logistic 
regression models tested the independence of key variables across strata of 
interest before and after covariate adjustment.
RESULTS: Peanut, almond, shellfish, and other tree nuts are more likely to be 
introduced to children with one or more food-allergic caregivers. Respondents 
with food-allergic parents (39.3%) and siblings with FA (35.8%) were more 
familiar with the 2017 NIAID guidelines compared to parents (12.9%) and siblings 
without FA (12.7%).
CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that respondents with food-allergic parents and 
siblings are more likely to have many of the most prevalent allergens introduced 
at younger ages, which could be due to knowledge related to the NIAID-sponsored 
guidelines and other national guidance, but that even among these higher-risk 
families overall rates of "early" introduction during infancy still remain 
relatively low.

Shellfish and fish are common causes of food allergy (FA) in Asia, with 
significant prevalence rates reported across various countries. This study aimed 
to identify the diagnostic decision points (DDPs) for shrimp, crab, and cod 
allergies in Korean children. We enrolled participants aged 18 years or younger 
with suspected shrimp, crab, or cod allergies through a retrospective review of 
medical records from a nationwide 14-center study between January 2018 and March 
2022. FA was diagnosed using an open oral food challenge or a reproducible and 
convincing history with positive serum specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels. 
The sIgE cut-off values for shrimp, crab, and cod were determined by analyzing 
receiver operating characteristic curves. Out of 266 children, 90 (33.8%) were 
confirmed to have a shrimp allergy. Crab allergies were found in 37 (39.8%) of 
93 children. Of 66 children, 15 (22.7%) were found to be allergic to cod. The 
optimal sIgE cut-off values based on the largest area under the curve were 1.43, 
3.25, and 2.05 kU/L for shrimp, crab, and cod, respectively. Levels of sIgE with 
more than 90% positive predictive value (PPV) were 33.8, 47.5, and 29.9 kU/L for 
shrimp, crab, and cod, respectively. Levels of sIgE with greater than 90% 
negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.36, 0.04, and 3.93 kU/L for shrimp, crab, 
and cod, respectively. Our results suggest that DDPs of sIgE levels with high 
PPV and NPV can be used to diagnose shrimp, crab, and cod allergies in Korean 
children.

PURPOSE: Crustacean shellfish is one of the eight most common food allergens, 
and crayfish is a highly valued shellfish species for consumption in China. 
However, the detailed allergen profile of crayfish remains unknown, with only 
four allergen groups reported in the WHO/IUIS allergen nomenclature database. In 
this study we aimed to identify novel allergens based on the Procambarus clarkii 
genome and to reveal its allergen profile for developing better diagnostic tools 
and treatments.
METHODS: We assembled the crayfish genome using both long-read and short-read 
sequencing data and identified putative allergens using the BLAST algorithm 
based on sequence homology. We employed bioinformatics tools to investigate the 
expression levels, gene structure, and synteny of these putative allergens. We 
also applied indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using patients' sera 
to determine allergenicity and utilized proteomic methods to identify novel 
allergens.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 11 putative allergen groups, including all 
isoforms or homologs for each allergen group based on the genome and three 
putative allergens by using 2-dimensional (2D) mass spectrometry. We identified 
2 novel allergens, pPro c 3.0301 and pPro c 6.0201, with immunoglobulin E 
reactivity of 33.3% and 20%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: By providing a comprehensive understanding of the complete allergen 
profile, our study presents a foundation for comprehending P. clarkii-associated 
allergy. The knowledge could facilitate the implementation of a 
components-resolved diagnostic test and preventive immunotherapy based on 
molecular allergens for crayfish allergy.

IgE antibodies raised against innocuous environmental antigens cause allergic 
diseases like allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and allergic asthma. While some 
allergies are often outgrown, others (peanut, shellfish, tree nut) are lifelong 
in the majority of individuals. Lifelong allergies are the result of persistent 
production of allergen-specific IgE. However, IgE antibodies and the plasma 
cells that secrete them tend to be short-lived. Persistent allergen-specific IgE 
titres are thought to be derived from the continued renewal of IgE plasma cells 
from memory B cells in response to allergen encounters. The initial generation 
of allergen-specific IgE is driven by B cell activation by IL-4 producing Tfh 
cells, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the long-term production of 
IgE are poorly characterized. This review investigates the mechanisms governing 
IgE production and Tfh activation in the primary and recall responses, towards 
the objective of identifying molecular targets for therapeutic intervention that 
durably inactivate the IgE recall response.

BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation in children is a vital procedure for those 
with end-stage organ failure, but it has been linked to the development of 
post-transplant allergies, especially food allergies. This phenomenon, known as 
transplant-acquired food allergy (TAFA), is becoming increasingly recognized, 
though its mechanisms remain under investigation. Pediatric transplant 
recipients often require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent graft 
rejection, which can alter immune function and heighten the risk of allergic 
reactions. Our review aimed to gather the latest evidence on TAFA.
METHODS: We conducted a PubMed search from 25 June to 5 July 2024, using 
specific search terms, identifying 143 articles. After screening, 36 studies 
were included: 24 retrospective studies, 1 prospective study, 2 cross-sectional 
researches, and 9 case reports/series.
RESULTS: Most studies focused on liver transplants in children. The prevalence 
of food allergies ranged from 3.3% to 54.3%. Tacrolimus, alongside 
corticosteroids, was the most commonly used immunosuppressive therapy. In 
addition to food allergies, some patients developed atopic dermatitis, asthma, 
and rhinitis. Allergic symptoms typically emerged within a year post-transplant, 
with common allergens including milk, eggs, fish, nuts, soy, wheat, and 
shellfish. Both IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions were observed, with 
treatment often involving the removal of offending foods and the use of 
adrenaline when necessary.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent immunological monitoring, such as skin prick tests and 
IgE level assessments, is essential for early detection and management of 
allergies in these patients. Understanding the link between transplantation and 
allergy development is crucial for improving long-term outcomes for pediatric 
transplant recipients.

BACKGROUND: Seafood allergy (SA), including allergy to shellfish (crustacean and 
mollusks) and fish, is among the 4 most common food allergies causing 
anaphylaxis, but there are limited data showing SA clinical management in 
different countries.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize a large cohort of patients with fish and 
shellfish allergy and to facilitate standardization of future care for this 
increasingly common allergic disease.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational, noninterventional study 
from 945 patients from 2015 to 2019 in 7 hospitals in the United States and the 
United Kingdom to evaluate SA. A chi-square test was used to detect differences 
in family history, medical history, and current symptoms between patients in 2 
countries.
RESULTS: Underdiagnosed anaphylaxis in patients with SA was associated with 
underuse of epinephrine (adrenaline) autoinjectors in both countries. Oral food 
challenge was used only when skin or serologic test results were negative. 
Asthma and allergic rhinitis were more common in the US patients with SA, but 
eczema was more common in UK patients with SA (P < .001). Respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms were higher in UK patients with SA 
than in US patients with SA (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In international multicenter cohorts of patients with fish and 
shellfish allergy, there are opportunities for improvement in management. 
Physician identification of anaphylaxis, use of diagnostic oral food challenges, 
and anaphylaxis treatment with epinephrine are areas with significant knowledge 
gaps in need of improvement in the United Kingdom and the United States. There 
is an opportunity for the development of unified, standardized diagnostic 
protocols for SA with distribution for allergists and trainees.

(1) Background: Food allergy (FA) is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity to 
foods, significantly contributing to childhood morbidity and mortality. This 
study aimed to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and influencing factors 
of parent-reported FAs among children in Saudi Arabia. (2) Methods: This 
cross-sectional study utilized a validated parental questionnaire distributed 
across all regions of Saudi Arabia. Data from 2130 participants were collected 
and analyzed using SPSS v. 26 and Prism software v. 10.3.0. (3) Results: 
Parent-reported FA prevalence was 15.2%. Egg was the most common allergen 
(6.2%), followed by tree nuts (4.1%), peanuts (4.0%), milk (3.8%), and sesame 
(3.2%). Significant geographical variations were observed, with the western 
region having the highest burden (p < 0.001). Older children had higher rates of 
shellfish and fish allergies. Parental allergies and co-existing asthma/drug 
allergies were positively associated with childhood FAs. (4) Conclusions: This 
study highlights a substantial burden of parent-reported FAs in Saudi Arabia, 
with regional variations in food allergen distribution. Parental allergies and 
co-existing allergic conditions may influence FA risk.

Although fish and shellfish allergies represent common worldwide allergies, with 
anaphylaxis being reportedly frequent, treatment approaches, e.g., oral 
immunotherapy (OIT), are uncommonly performed. A review of the limited 
literature is discussed here. Both practical and immunologic challenges are 
common with seafood OIT, including taste, odor, unclear and potentially 
inconsistent cross-reactivity, and alteration of protein concentration during 
the cooking process as well as other concerns. Ongoing attempts at 
standardization of this OIT process should be considered. The experienced OIT 
physician may consider this treatment in patients who are motivated to begin 
OIT.

Food allergies have increased significantly in recent decades, with shellfish 
being a leading cause of food allergy and anaphylaxis worldwide, affecting both 
children and adults. The prevalence of shellfish allergies is estimated to be 
approximately 0.5-2.5% of the general population, varying significantly by 
geographical location, age, and consumption habits. Although mollusk consumption 
has risen, the prevalence of mollusk allergies remains unknown. While extensive 
research has focused on crustacean allergies, mollusk allergies, particularly 
those related to gastropods, have received comparatively less attention. 
Clinical manifestations of shellfish allergy range from localized symptoms to 
life-threatening systemic reactions, such as anaphylaxis. Notably, severe 
bronchospasm is a predominant clinical feature in cases involving gastropods. 
Several allergens have been identified in mollusks, including paramyosin, 
tropomyosin, and sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein. In gastropods, documented 
allergens include tropomyosin, paramyosin, the heavy chain of myosin, and Der p 
4 amylase. Diagnosis typically involves a thorough clinical history, skin 
testing, in vitro quantification of immunoglobulin (Ig) E, and confirmation 
through an oral challenge, although the latter is reserved for selected cases. 
This narrative review highlights the limited research on gastropod allergy. It 
provides a comprehensive list of purified and recombinant allergens and 
discusses the applications of component-resolved diagnosis as well as current 
therapeutic developments.

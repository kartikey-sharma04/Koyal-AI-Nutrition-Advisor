OBJECTIVE: There have been unsafe levels of unpaired fructose in the high 
fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in US beverages, and research/case study evidence 
shows that their intake is associated with greater asthma 
prevalence/risk/incidence, a debilitating disease, likely due to fructose 
malabsorption, gut fructosylation and gut dysbiosis mechanisms. The 
'unexplained' asthma epidemic has disproportionately affected children and Black 
individuals, groups with higher fructose malabsorption prevalence than others, 
and research to assess disproportionately higher asthma risk/incidence among 
Black individuals in association with HFCS-sweetened beverage intake is lacking.
DESIGN: Demographic, lifestyle and dietary data collected at enrollment 
(1985-86), and incident asthma through exam 5 (1995-96), were used in Cox 
proportional hazards models to assess HFCS intake associations (hazard ratios) 
with asthma risk/incidence.
SETTING: CARDIA study participants from Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, 
Minneapolis, MN and Oakland, CA.
PARTICIPANTS: 1998 Black and 2104 White young adults.
RESULTS: HFCS-sweetened beverage intake > once/week was significantly associated 
with higher asthma risk relative to ≤ once/week (P-trend = 0·04), among Black 
participants only; risk was 2·8 times higher among 2-4 times/week consumers (HR 
= 2·8, 95 % CI 1·1, 7·3, P = 0·04) and 3·5 times higher when consumed multiple 
times/d, independent of sucrose intake/obesity/dietary quality/smoking/in-home 
smoke-exposure (HR = 3·5, 95 % CI 1·3, 9·9, P = 0·02). Intake of orange juice, 
with nominal unpaired fructose, was not associated with asthma in either group, 
nor was intake of sucrose, a disaccharide (paired) of fructose/glucose.
CONCLUSIONS: Ubiquitous HFCS in the US food supply, with HFCS that contains 
high/unsafe unpaired fructose, also known as excess-free-fructose, and the 
fructose/gut/lung/axis are overlooked risk factors in the 'unexplained' US 
asthma epidemic that disproportionately affects Black individuals.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with enhanced inflammation. However, 
investigation in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) is limited and 
the mechanisms by which inflammation occurs have not been well elucidated. 
Marine long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs) have 
anti-inflammatory actions and may reduce scWAT inflammation.
METHODS: Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) biopsies were collected from 
individuals living with obesity (n=45) and normal weight individuals (n=39) 
prior to and following a 12-week intervention with either 3 g/day of a fish oil 
concentrate (providing 1.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + 0.8 g docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA)) or 3 g/day of corn oil. ScWAT fatty acid, oxylipin, and 
transcriptome profiles were assessed by gas chromatography, ultra-pure liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR, 
respectively.
FINDINGS: Obesity was associated with greater scWAT inflammation demonstrated by 
lower concentrations of specialised pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and 
hydroxy-DHA metabolites and an altered transcriptome with differential 
expression of genes involved in LC n-3 PUFA activation, oxylipin synthesis, 
inflammation, and immune response. Intervention with LC n-3 PUFAs increased 
their respective metabolites including the SPM precursor 14-hydroxy-DHA in 
normal weight individuals and decreased arachidonic acid derived metabolites and 
expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory response with a greater 
effect in normal weight individuals.
INTERPRETATION: Downregulated expression of genes responsible for fatty acid 
activation and metabolism may contribute to an inflammatory oxylipin profile and 
limit the effects of LC n-3 PUFAs in obesity. There may be a need for 
personalised LC n-3 PUFA supplementation based on obesity status.

BACKGROUND: The immune response of aged broiler breeder hens is influenced by 
many factors including obesity and aged lymphatic organs, but may improve by 
increasing the bioavailability of various nutrients such as zinc (Zn). Dietary 
supplementation of phytase can improve Zn availability in senescent broiler 
breeder hens.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementary zinc 
oxide (ZnO) and phytase in a maize-soybean meal-based diet on immune responses 
of broiler breeder hens.
METHODS: In a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement, a total of 128 hens were randomly 
assigned into eight groups. The birds received two levels of phytase (0 or 300 
U/kg diet) and four levels of ZnO (30, 60, 90, and 120 mg/kg diet) for 13 
successive wk (59-72 wk of age).
RESULTS: Results showed that phytase supplementation significantly increased 
immunoglobulin M (IgM), cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) responses, 
total number of leukocytes, percentage of lymphocytes, and heterophil to 
lymphocyte ratios. The percentage of basophils and monocytes, however, decreased 
with phytase supplementation. Supplementation of ZnO increased anti-sheep red 
blood cells (SRBC) antibody titer, IgM, CBH responses, the total number of 
leukocytes, and the percentage of lymphocytes. Dietary supplementation of ZnO 
decreased the percentage of heterophil, and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio. A 
significant interaction effect of phytase and ZnO was found on the total number 
of leukocytes and percentage of lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation of ZnO (90 mg/kg diet) and phytase had some 
positive effects on improving immune responses in broiler breeder hens.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess changes in serum immunoglobulin 
G (IgG) food antibody titers and quality-of-life measurements following a 
targeted elimination diet in overweight/obese adults.
METHODS: We performed a randomized control trial. Participants were randomized 
in a 2:1 ratio to either an intervention group or waitlist group for 3 months. 
Food IgG testing was performed on all participants. The intervention group was 
instructed to eliminate up to 10 foods, for which they had high titers of IgG 
and communicated with health coaches for nutritional counseling for meal 
planning and adherence. The waitlist group did not receive their IgG testing 
results or health coaching. Primary outcome was serum IgG titers for foods 
eliminated during the trial, compared with baseline concentrations. Secondary 
outcomes were health-related quality of life measured by Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) and change in 
participant-identified symptom severity measured by Measure Yourself Medical 
Outcome Profile. Exploratory outcomes were changes in body weight and waist 
circumference.
RESULTS: IgG antibody concentrations decreased in 83% of the targeted foods in 
the treatment group and in 60% of the foods in the waitlist group, but this was 
not found to be a statistically significant difference. The intervention group 
reported improvement in sleep during the trial compared with waitlist, which was 
the only statistically significant finding in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with changes in IgG titer measurements 
following an elimination diet based on IgG testing. Future larger clinical 
trials are necessary to determine the degree to which these findings are 
generalizable.

Excess free fructose, high-fructose corn syrup and adult asthma: the Framingham 
Offspring Cohort.

There is growing evidence that intakes of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), 
HFCS-sweetened soda, fruit drinks and apple juice - a high-fructose 100 % juice 
- are associated with asthma, possibly because of the high fructose:glucose 
ratios and underlying fructose malabsorption, which may contribute to enteral 
formation of pro-inflammatory advanced glycation end products, which bind 
receptors that are mediators of asthma. Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to assess associations between intakes of these beverages and asthma risk, 
with data from the Framingham Offspring Cohort. Diet soda and orange juice - a 
100 % juice with a 1:1 fructose:glucose ratio - were included for comparison. 
Increasing intake of any combination of HFCS-sweetened soda, fruit drinks and 
apple juice was significantly associated with progressively higher asthma risk, 
plateauing at 5-7 times/week v. never/seldom, independent of potential 
confounders (hazard ratio 1·91, P<0·001). About once a day consumers of 
HFCS-sweetened soda had a 49 % higher risk (P<0·011), moderate apple juice 
consumers (2-4 times/week) had a 61 % higher risk (P<0·007) and moderate fruit 
drink consumers had a 58 % higher risk (P<0·009), as compared with never/seldom 
consumers. There were no associations with diet soda/orange juice. These 
associations are possibly because of the high fructose:glucose ratios, and 
fructose malabsorption. Recommendations to reduce consumption may be inadequate 
to address asthma risk, as associations are evident even with moderate intake of 
these beverages, including apple juice - a 100 % juice. The juice reductions in 
the US Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children 
in 2009, and the plateauing/decreasing asthma prevalence (2010-2013), 
particularly among non-Hispanic black children, may be related. Further research 
regarding the consequences of fructose malabsorption is needed.

BACKGROUND: Both aging and obesity are related to dysregulated immune function, 
which may be responsible for increased risk of infection and also chronic 
non-infectious diseases. Dietary lipids have been shown to impact immune and 
inflammatory responses and cardio-metabolic risk factors. No information on the 
impact of olive oil on immune responses of overweight and obese older adults is 
available.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the effect of replacing oils used in a typical 
American diet with extra virgin olive oil for 3 months on immune responses and 
cardio-metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese older adults.
METHODS: This was a randomized, single-blinded and placebo-controlled trial in 
41 overweight or obese participants (aged ≥ 65) who consumed a typical American 
diet. Participants in the control (CON, n = 21) group were provided with a 
mixture of corn, soybean oil and butter, and those in the olive oil (OO, n = 20) 
group, with extra virgin olive oil, to replace substitutable oils in their diet. 
At baseline and 3 months, we measured blood pressure, biochemical and 
immunological parameters using fasting blood, and delayed-type hypersensitivity 
(DTH) skin response.
RESULTS: Compared to the CON group, the OO group showed decreased systolic blood 
pressure (P < 0.05), a strong trend toward increased plasma HDL-C concentrations 
(P = 0.06), and increased anti-CD3/anti-CD28 -stimulated T cell proliferation 
(P < 0.05). No differences were found in T cell phenotype, cytokine production, 
and DTH response between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that substitution of oils used in a typical 
American diet with extra virgin olive oil in overweight and obese older adults 
may have cardio-metabolic and immunological health benefits. This trial was 
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01903304.

Agricultural outputs have resulted in food production continuously expanding. To 
satisfy the needs of a fast growing human population, higher yields, more 
efficient food processing, and food esthetic value, new crop varieties with 
higher caloric intake have and continue to be developed, but which lack many 
phytochemicals important for plant protection and adequate human nutrition. The 
increasing incidence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and 
cardiovascular diseases, combined with social disparity worldwide prompted the 
interest in developing enhanced crops that can simultaneously address the two 
sides of the current malnutrition sword, increasing yield while providing added 
nutritional value. Flavones, phytochemicals associated with the beneficial 
effects of the Mediterranean diet, have potent anti-inflammatory and 
anti-carcinogenic activities. However, many Mediterranean diet-associated 
vegetables are inaccessible, or lowly consumed, in many parts of the world. 
Maize is the most widely grown cereal crop, yet most lines used for hybrid maize 
production lack flavones. As a first step toward a sustainable strategy to 
increasing the nutritional value of maize-based diets, we investigated the 
accumulation and chemical properties of flavones in maize seeds of defined 
genotypes. We show that the pericarps of the P1-rr genotype accumulate flavones 
at levels comparable to those present in some flavone-rich vegetables, and are 
mostly present in their C- and O-glycosylated forms. Some of these glycosides 
can be readily converted into the corresponding more active health beneficial 
aglycones during food processing. Our results provide evidence that 
nutritionally beneficial flavones could be re-introduced into elite lines to 
increase the dietary benefits of maize.

[Molecular mechanisms of action and health benefits of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids].

Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), linoleic acid n6 (LA) and 
linolenic acid (ALA) n3 obtained from the diet are precursors of the long-chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (Lc-PUFAs) arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA) respectively. Consumption of PUFAs is related with a better 
neurological and cognitive development in newborns. It has been demonstrated 
that consumption of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs decreases blood triglycerides by 
increasing fatty acid oxidation through activation of PPARalpha or by reducing 
the activation of SREBP-1 inhibiting lipogenesis. Dietary PUFAs activate 
PPARalpha and PPARgamma increasing lipid oxidation, and decreasing insulin 
resistance leading in a reduction of hepatic steatosis. Beneficial effects of 
PUFAs have been observed in humans and in animals models of diabetes, obesity, 
cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. It is important to promote the consumption 
of PUFAs. Main food sources of PUFAs n-6 are corn, soy and safflower oil, and 
for PUFAs n-3 are fish, soy, canola oil and, flaxseed. Finally FAO/WHO 
recommends an optimal daily intake of n6/n3 of 5-10:1.

RATIONALE: Following the withdrawal of organochlorines and organophosphates, 
pyrethroids have become the most used insecticides in both agricultural and 
domestic settings.
OBJECTIVES: We analyzed data from the French AGRICAN agricultural cohort to 
assess associations of occupational pyrethroid exposures and 
allergic/non-allergic asthma.
METHODS: At enrollment, asthma diagnosed by a doctor was reported by 11 815 
participants (7028 classified as non-allergic and 4458 as allergic based on the 
presence of eczema and/or hay fever). Individual exposures to 17 pyrethroids 
were defined in 124 992 participants, based on a combination of the history of 
pesticide treatment of 11 crops (grassland, vineyard, wheat/barley, corn, field 
peas, potatoes, tobacco, beets, sunflower, rape, fruits) and a crop-exposure 
matrix.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In men, no association was observed for any of 
the pyrethroids regardless of asthma phenotype. In contrast, in ever-exposed 
women, asthma risk was increased with use of any pyrethroid, both for allergic 
(+80 %) and non-allergic asthma (+40 %). Highest increases were observed for 
allergic asthma with fenpropathrin (OR = 2.00; 95 %CI:1.38-2.90), tralomethrin 
(OR = 1.81; 95 %CI:1.28-2.56), fenvalerate (OR = 1.81; 95 %CI:1.38-2.38), 
permethrin (OR = 1.78; 95 %CI:1.26-2.50) and deltamethrin (OR = 1.76; 
95 %CI:1.35-2.29). Stratified analyses on women who reported living on a farm in 
early life showed stronger associations for non-allergic asthma. For women who 
reported early life living on vineyards associations with pyrethroids were 
stronger for both allergic and non-allergic asthma. Associations for women who 
lived on cattle farms were reduced for some pyrethroids.
CONCLUSION: Occupational pyrethroid exposure was positively associated with both 
allergic and non-allergic asthma in women but not in men.

BACKGROUND: Allergic colitis (AC) is one of the most common etiologies of rectal 
bleeding in infants aged one to six months.
AIM: The aim of this study is to apply step-by-step dietary restrictions in the 
mother's diet or change of infant formula fed thereby, to evaluate the 
subsequent clinical response.
METHODS: Sixty healthy infants whose clinical and evaluation results indicated 
proctocolitis in our outpatient gastroenterology clinic were included in this. 
They were divided into three groups according to the type of feeding; group 1 
were exclusively breast fed, group 2 were exclusively formula fed and group 3 
were fed with combination of both. In breast feeding women, discontinuation was 
allergenic food was studied in four stages; cow-related dairy products, soy, 
sesame and fast food (stage A), egg (stage B), corn, nuts and fish (stage C) and 
wheat (stage D).
RESULTS: Sixty newborns with age at symptom onset 3 days-20 days participated in 
the study. Up to the time of our initial evaluation, the mean age and weight of 
infants was 73.34 ± 1.00 day and 3292.71 ± 367.93 g, respectively. There was no 
significant difference in sex and the type of labor between the groups. 
Thirty-three infants had a history of eczema and the parents of 47 infants had a 
history of allergy, with the greatest prevalence in group one. Rectal bleeding 
in 50% of infants was halted after the elimination of allergenic feed in mother 
(15 in stage A, 8 in stage B and 7 in stage C). Ten infants needed extensive 
hydrolyzed formula and 20 needed amino acid-based formulas.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no need for immediate use of amino acid or extensive 
hydrolyzed formulas in the first stage of blood in stool, perhaps discontinuing 
allergenic food in mothers could be the primary measure.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations of inhalable grain dust exposure with 
respiratory health outcomes, rhinitis, and eczema reported by workers from rice, 
wheat, and maize storage facilities.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 136 workers (73 operators and 63 
administrative staff and other workers) from eight Costa Rican grain storage 
facilities was conducted in 2014-2015. Full-shift personal inhalable dust 
samples from all workers were collected. Study participants were administered a 
short version of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire 
to identify symptoms of asthma, chronic bronchitis, rhinitis, and eczema. 
Associations between grain dust exposure and health outcomes were assessed using 
multivariable logistic and negative binomial regression models adjusted for age, 
smoking history, grain type, and presence of pets or farm animals in the home.
RESULTS: The median inhalable grain dust concentration was 2.0 (25th to 75th 
percentile: 0.3-7.0) mg m-3. Higher concentrations of inhalable dust were 
associated with increased odds of (i) asthma symptoms or medication use 
[adjusted Odds ratio (ORa) per 10-fold increase in dust concentration 2.7; 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.3-6.7]; (ii) a score of at least two out of five 
symptoms suggestive of asthma (ORa 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0-1.3); and (iii) eczema (ORa 
3.6; 95% CI: 1.7-9.6). No associations of inhalable grain dust exposure with 
chronic bronchitis and rhinitis were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: High exposure to inhalable dust in Costa Rican grain storage 
facilities was associated to asthma symptoms and eczema in workers.

BACKGROUND: Food allergy (FA) is a prevalent condition in the United States, but 
little is known about its phenotypes in racial minority groups.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize disease phenotypes 
and disparities in health care utilization among African American (AA), 
Hispanic, and white children with FA.
METHODS: We conducted a large, 2-center, retrospective cohort study of children 
aged 0-17 years with FA seen in allergy/immunology clinics at 2 urban tertiary 
care centers in the United States. We used multiple logistic regression analyses 
adjusted for age, gender, and insurance.
RESULTS: The cohort of 817 children was composed of 35% AA, 12% Hispanic, and 
53% non-Hispanic white. Compared with non-Hispanic white children, AA children 
had significantly higher odds of having asthma and eczema (P < .01), and 
significantly higher odds of allergy to wheat, soy, corn, fish, and shellfish (P 
< .01). Compared with non-Hispanic white children, Hispanic children had 
significantly higher odds of allergy to corn, fish, and shellfish (P < .01), and 
higher odds of eczema (P < .01), but a similar rate of asthma (P = .44). In this 
cohort, 55%, 18%, and 11% of AA, Hispanic, and white children were covered by 
Medicaid, respectively (P < .00001). Compared with whites, AA and Hispanic 
children had a shorter duration of follow-up for FA with an allergy specialist 
and higher rates of FA-related anaphylaxis and emergency department visits (P < 
.01).
CONCLUSIONS: FA phenotypes and health care utilization differ among children of 
different racial and/or ethnic backgrounds in the United States that put AA and 
Hispanic children at higher risks of adverse outcome than white children. These 
differences include coexistent atopic conditions, less well recognized food 
allergens, and higher rates of anaphylaxis.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of atopic diseases in children with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (DM1) has been reported as lower. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the prevalence of allergic diseases and allergic sensitisation in Brazilian 
children and adolescents with DM1.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 patients with DM1 (aged 4-18 years, 45 boys) followed 
for at least one year were evaluated for allergic disease through a detailed 
allergological anamnesis and skin prick tests (SPT) to inhalant allergens 
(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, D. farinae, Blomia tropicalis, Blattella 
germanica, Periplaneta americana, dog epithelium, cat epithelium, mix fungi), 
foods (cow's milk, egg-white, yolk, soy, wheat, corn), and positive (histamine 1 
mg/ml) and negative (saline) controls. Wheals with a mean diameter of induration 
equal to or greater than 3mm identified a positive SPT.
RESULTS: The prevalence values of rhinitis, asthma and atopic eczema (isolated 
or associated) were 68.0%, 59.1% and 44.4%, respectively. 20.6% of the patients 
had no allergic disease. 46.8% of the patients had been diagnosed with DM1 for 
at least four years and there was no relationship between the period of DM1 and 
the presence of allergic disease, nor of the gender. 48.0% patients were 
sensitised with predominance of D. pteronyssinus, B. topicalis and D. farinae. 
The frequency of positive SPT was significantly higher among patients with 
history of allergic disease (OR=6.98, 95%CI: 2.60-18.74, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of allergic diseases and sensitisation in patients 
with DM1 was higher than usually expected and deserves further investigation to 
identify possible causes for these findings and to evaluate their importance and 
influence on the metabolic control.

BACKGROUND: Many people with atopic eczema are reluctant to use the most 
commonly recommended treatments because they fear the long-term health effects. 
As a result, many turn to dietary supplements as a possible treatment approach, 
often with the belief that some essential ingredient is 'missing' in their diet. 
Various supplements have been proposed, but it is unclear whether any of these 
interventions are effective.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate dietary supplements for treating established atopic 
eczema/dermatitis.Evening primrose oil, borage oil, and probiotics are covered 
in other Cochrane reviews.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to July 2010: the 
Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE 
(from 2007), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), ISI Web 
of Science, GREAT (Global Resource of EczemA Trials) database, and reference 
lists of articles. We searched ongoing trials registers up to April 2011.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary supplements 
for the treatment of those with established atopic eczema/dermatitis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the titles and 
abstracts, read the full text of the publications, extracted data, and assessed 
the risk of bias.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies with a total of 596 participants. Two 
studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. The following 
were all looked at in single studies: oral zinc sulphate compared to placebo, 
selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus 
placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D plus vitamin E together 
versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea 
buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil 
(linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control 
(saturated fatty acids of the same energy value). Two small studies on fish oil 
suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored. A 
convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly-registered 
protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary 
supplements in eczema, and they cannot be recommended for the public or for 
clinical practice at present. Whilst some may argue that at least supplements do 
not do any harm, high doses of vitamin D may give rise to serious medical 
problems, and the cost of long-term supplements may also mount up.

A 27-year-old white woman was referred for consultation with regard to the 
presence of extensive multiple keratotic lesions. She began to develop these 
lesions at the age of 9 years, with healing of the lesions resulting in scar 
formation. A biopsy was performed at the age of 16 years, but the patient was 
unsure of the results. Since then, she had not had any treatment or biopsies, 
and stated that she had not suffered from any health problems during the 
intervening period. She was most concerned about the tumors on her heels and 
soles, which caused difficulty with ambulation. The family history was negative 
for skin diseases, including melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, psoriasis, and 
eczema, and positive for Type II diabetes mellitus. A relative reported that the 
patient's grandfather had similar lesions, but the patient's parents and 
siblings were healthy. She was married and had one child, a 9-year-old daughter. 
Her child had no skin lesions. The patient's only medication was 
Ortho-Tricyclene birth control pills. She had no known drug allergies. Physical 
examination revealed the presence of multiple lesions on her body (Fig. 1). Her 
left superior helix contained a well-demarcated, dome-shaped nodule with a 
rolled, mildly erythematous border with a central hyperkeratotic plug. A similar 
lesion was present in the scaphoid fossa of the left ear and smaller lesions 
were scattered on her face. Numerous lesions were present on the arms and legs 
bilaterally, with the majority of lesions being located on the anterior lower 
legs. There were also lesions present on the palms and soles. The lesions ranged 
in size from 5 mm to 3 cm, the largest being a verrucous exophytic nodule on the 
anterior aspect of her left leg. Overall, there appeared to be two distinct 
types of lesion. One type appeared round, oval, and symmetric with a central 
keratotic plug, similar to that on the ear. The other type was larger, more 
exophytic, and verrucous, including the lesions on the volar surfaces. Also 
present were numerous, irregularly shaped atrophic scars where previous lesions 
had healed spontaneously. There were no oral lesions or lesions on her 
fingernails or toenails, and her teeth and hair were normal. A biopsy was 
obtained from an early lesion on the right dorsal forearm. Histology revealed an 
exo-/endophytic growth having a central crater containing keratinous material 
(Fig. 2). The crater was surrounded by markedly hyperplastic squamous epithelium 
with large squamous epithelial cells having abundant glassy cytoplasm. Some 
cells were dyskeratotic. Within the dermis was a dense, chiefly mononuclear 
inflammatory infiltrate. A buttress of epidermis surrounded the crater. The 
clinical and pathologic data were consistent with keratoacanthomas. Initial 
laboratory screenings revealed elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol, 537 
mg/dL (normal, < 150 mg/dL) and 225 mg/dL (normal, < 200 mg/dL), respectively, 
with all other laboratory results within normal limits. In anticipation of 
starting oral retinoid therapy for her multiple keratoacanthomas, she was 
referred to her primary care physician for control of hyperlipidemia. After her 
lipids had been controlled, she was placed on isotretinoin (Accutane) 40 mg/day. 
There was some interval improvement with regression of some lesions leaving 
atrophic scars. She was also started on topical application of tazarotene 
(Tazorac) for all nonresolving lesions. Possible side-effects from the 
isotretinoin occurred, including dry mouth and eyes. After 8 months of 
isotretinoin, the patient was switched to acitretin (Soriatane) 25 mg to 
determine whether it might have a more beneficial effect on the resistant 
lesions. Many of the larger lesions regressed leaving atrophic scars. The dose 
of acitretin was subsequently increased to 35 mg because the lesions on her heel 
and the ball of her foot persisted. Almost all of the lesions resolved, except 
those on her feet, which are slowly regressing. Currently, the patient is on a 
regimen of acitretin 25 mg once a day with tazarotene 0.1% gel applied directly 
to the few residual keratoacanthomas on her feet, which are slowly improving.

We compared the dietary effects of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) contained 
in the DGLA oil produced by a fungus with gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) on the 
fatty acid composition. Wistar rats were fed with three kinds of oil for two 
weeks as follows: (i) control group: corn oil; (ii) GLA group: borage oil; (iii) 
DGLA group: DGLA oil/safflower oil = 55:45. The DGLA concentrations in the 
liver, serum, and brain of the DGLA group were higher than those of the GLA oil 
group. We also examined the dose effect of DGLA. The DGLA levels in the liver, 
serum, and brain significantly increased with increasing dosage of DGLA in the 
diet. DGLA administration significantly increased the ratio of PGE1/PGE2 in the 
rat plasma. The mechanism for GLA administration to improve atopic eczema is 
thought to involve an increase in the concentration of DGLA metabolized from 
GLA, so these results suggest that the dietary effect of DGLA would be more 
dominant than GLA.

Immediate hypersensitivity to natural rubber latex has increased since the early 
1980s. High prevalence of latex sensitization and allergy are observed among 
healthcare workers, atopic individuals and children who had undergone multiple 
surgical operations (spina bifida, congenital anomalies). Presenting symptoms 
are polymorphous: contact urticaria, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, and 
anaphylaxis. Corn-starch-latex particles released in the air after powdered 
gloves manipulation may be inhaled and lead to occupational asthma. The 
diagnosis may be made by a focused clinical history, prick-test, detection of 
specific IgE antibody and challenge test. Almost half of patients allergic to 
natural rubber latex show an associated fruit allergy: avocado, banana, kiwi, 
chestnut. Most of cutaneous delayed reactions (eczema) to rubber are caused by 
rubber additives (accelerators of vulcanization, anti-oxidants).

Atopy patch test in the diagnosis of food allergy in children with atopic eczema 
dermatitis syndrome.

PURPOSE: Food allergy has been demonstrated to play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of atopic eczema dermatitis syndrome (AEDS), affecting often atopic 
infants and young children. The most commonly offending foods are cow's milk, 
hen's egg, wheat and soy; implicating immediate (IgE-mediated) and late-phase 
(T-cells) immunological reactions in the pathogenesis of skin lesions. The 
diagnostic work-up of suspected immediate food reactions includes skin prick 
tests (SPT) and the measurement of food-specific antibodies (sIgE). The 
methodology of atopy patch test (APT) has been reported as a diagnostic tool 
with high predictive capacity for late-phase clinical reactions in children with 
atopic dermatitis. Although APT has been introduced into the diagnostic 
procedure for food allergy, its diagnostic accuracy remains still controversial; 
especially in older children. The aim of study was to evaluate the diagnostic 
accuracy of the atopy patch test in the detection of food allergy in correlation 
with SPT, sIgE and positive oral food challenge to milk, in children suffering 
from AEDS and to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this method in 
dependence on the age of investigated children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 34 children (25 boys, 9 girls) aged 5 months-16 years with 
suspicion of milk-related AEDS were investigated. These patients were subdivided 
into 2 age groups: group A--20 children (<3 years), group B--14 children (>3 
years). The diagnostic procedures as skin-prick tests and atopy patch test were 
performed. The specific IgE to cow's milk allergens were also measured. The open 
and blind diagnostic oral food challenge were performed to verify the results of 
tests. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive 
value of APT were calculated in both age groups.
RESULTS: A positive challenge response to milk was found in 65.0% of 
investigated children in group A and in 35.7% in group B. No statistical 
differences in the prevalence of immediate (p<0.1905) and delayed-type (p<0.409) 
reactions has been found between age groups. Positive APT to milk were noticed 
in 55.0% of patients in group A and in 35.7% of children from group B, that has 
been in correlation with positive delayed-type reactions in oral food challenge 
in 72.7% and 80.0% in corresponding age groups. Polysensitization to other food 
allergens confirmed by SPT and/or sIgE was detected in 35.0% of patients younger 
than 3 years of age and in 50.0% of older children. The prevalence of positive 
APT to other foods (soy, rice, maize, cereals) was significantly higher 
(p<0.0073) in the polysensitized children from group A. Sensitivity of SPT/sIgE 
in children with immediate-type reactions to milk was 100%, specificity 94%. 
Sensitivity of APT to cow's milk in children with late-phase reactions was 80% 
in both age groups; specificity 70%/89% with comparable PPV in both groups 
(73%/80%). Parallel skin testing with combined patch test and evaluation of sIgE 
enhanced the value of sensitivity to 92% in the group A and specificity to 89% 
in the group B. For PPV corresponding figures were 85%/80%.
CONCLUSIONS: APT was found to be more sensitive and specific method than 
SPT/sIgE in diagnosing delayed food allergy in children with AEDS. No age 
correlation between positive results of APT and oral food challenge and higher 
specificity of APT in older children confirm its accuracy in diagnosing delayed 
cow's milk allergy in all age groups of children. Combined skin prick and patch 
testing significantly enhances identification of food allergy in children with 
AEDS. The outcome of the APT with food does not seem to be influenced by age of 
children, but because of its variability of sensitivity and specificity, a 
diagnosis of food allergy should be confirmed by oral food challenge.

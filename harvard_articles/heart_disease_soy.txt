üîó Straight Talk About Soy
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/soy/

The Takeaway:Soy is a unique food that is widely studied for its estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects on the body. Studies may seem to present conflicting conclusions about soy, but this is largely due to the wide variation in how soy is studied. Results of recent population studies suggest that soy has either a beneficial or neutral effect on various health conditions. Soy is a nutrient-dense source of protein that can safely be consumed several times a week, and probably more often, and is likely to provide health benefits‚Äîespecially when eaten as an alternative to red and processed meat.
Soy is exalted as a health food by some, with claims of taming hot flashes, warding off osteoporosis, and protecting againsthormonal cancerslike breast and prostate.
At the same time, soy is shunned by others for fear that it may cause breast cancer, thyroid problems, and dementia, though these claims have not been substantiated.
Whether published in a popular press article or a well-designed clinical study, some debate about soy remains. As a species within thelegume family, nutrition scientists often label soy as a food with potential for significant health benefits. However, due to contrary research that suggests possible negative effects of soy in certain situations, there has been a hesitancy to wholeheartedly promote soy.
Part of the uncertainty is due to the intricacy of soy‚Äôs effects on the body. Soy is unique in that it contains a high concentration of isoflavones, a type of plant estrogen (phytoestrogen) that is similar in function to human estrogen but with much weaker effects. Soy isoflavones can bind to estrogen receptors in the body and cause either weak estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity. The two major soy isoflavones are called genistein and daidzein. Soy isoflavones and soy protein appear to have different actions in the body based on the following factors:
Thus, there are many factors that make it difficult to construct blanket statements about the health effects of soy.
Aside from their isoflavone content, soy foods are rich in nutrients includingB vitamins,fiber,potassium,magnesium, andhigh-quality protein. Unlike some plant proteins, soy protein is considered a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot make which must be obtained from the diet. Soy foods are also classified as fermented or unfermented (see table with examples, below). Fermented means that the soy food has been cultured withbeneficial bacteria, yeast, or mold. Some believe that fermenting soy improves its digestibility and absorption in the body, as this process partially breaks down soy‚Äôs sugar and protein molecules.
Learn more about the research on soy and specific diseases or other conditions:
Soy protein took center stage after research showed that it might lower levels of harmful cholesterol. A 1995 meta-analysis of 38 controlled clinical trials showed that eating approximately 50 grams of soy protein a day (no small amount as this translates to 1¬Ω pounds of tofu or eight 8-ounce glasses of soy milk!) in place of animal protein reduced harmful LDL cholesterol by 12.9 percent. [1] Such reductions, if sustained over time, could mean a greater than 20% lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or other forms of cardiovascular disease. In response to this finding, in 1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed companies to claim that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that also contain soy ‚Äúmay reduce the risk of heart disease.‚Äù [2]
However, a number of studies since have tempered that finding. [3] According to a comprehensive update of soy research by the nutrition committee of the American Heart Association (AHA) published in 2000, eating 50 grams of soy per day lowered LDL by only about 3%. [3] In October 2017, after review of additional scientific studies since the health claim was authorized, the FDA proposed a rule to revoke the claim because numerous studies presented inconsistent findings on the relationship between soy protein and heart disease. [4] Some of these inconsistencies may have resulted because soy was compared with a variety of alternative foods.
Even though soy protein may have only a small direct effect on cholesterol, soy may still benefit the heart in other ways. An epidemiological study following three large cohorts of American men and women who did not have cardiovascular disease at the start of the study found that those who ate the highest amounts of tofu and isoflavones from soy foods, compared with those who ate the least, had an 18% and 13% lower risk, respectively, of developing heart disease. [5] The benefit of tofu was stronger in premenopausal women and postmenopausal women not using hormone therapy.
Soy foods are generally good for the heart and blood vessels because they provide polyunsaturated fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and are low in saturated fat. Replacing red meat with plant proteins including soy foods, beans, and nuts was associated with a 14% lower risk of heart disease, as found in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a large long-term epidemiological study of more than 43,000 men. [6] Another large cohort of more than 500,000 Chinese adults with no previous cardiovascular disease found that those with the highest intakes of soy (4+ days a week) compared with those who never ate soy had a 25% lower risk of deaths from heart attack. [7]
Hormone replacement therapy has traditionally been used as an effective treatment for hot flashes and other unpleasant symptoms that accompany menopause, but its long-term use has raised concerns of an increased risk of some diseases including breast cancer and stroke. Soy has been a popular alternative treatment but not clearly supported by research; in theory the potential estrogenic effects of soy isoflavones could help to tame hot flashes by giving an estrogen-like boost during a time of dwindling estrogen levels.
In many Far East Asian countries where soy is eaten daily, women have lower rates of menopausal symptoms, although research is conflicting as to whether soy is a primary contributor. [8] Reports suggest that about 70‚Äì80% of U.S. women of menopausal and perimenopausal age experience hot flashes, in comparison with 10‚Äì20% of Far Eastern Asian women. [9] Further, the average blood concentration of the isoflavone genistein in Asian women who regularly consume soy is about 12 times higher than that of U.S. women. [9]
Yet several meta-analyses and carefully controlled clinical studies have not found strong evidence of a link. [10,11] An AHA review in 2006 concluded that it was unlikely that soy isoflavones exert enough estrogenic activity to have an important impact on hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause. [3] A JAMA review the same year found highly conflicting results with soy isoflavone extracts and stated that the overall evidence did not support its benefit in relieving hot flashes. [12]
In another review of 43 randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of phytoestrogens on hot flashes and night sweats in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Four trials found that extracts of 30 mg or greater of genistein consistently reduced the frequency of hot flashes. Other trials that used dietary soy or soy extracts suggested a reduced frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats when compared with placebo, but these trials were small with a possible strong placebo effect. [8] No adverse effects were noted from the soy treatments when followed for up to two years, but the authors did not feel overall there was strong and consistent evidence for a benefit of soy.
Another meta-analysis of 16 studies found that soy isoflavone supplements had a small and gradual effect in weakening menopausal hot flashes compared with estradiol (human estrogen). However, authors noted weaknesses in the analysis due to a small number of participants and high variability in study design. [9]
A more recent review of randomized trials found that some studies showed benefit of soy supplements on hot flashes; the therapeutic dosage ranged from 40-70 mg of isoflavones daily. [13] The authors also observed that the presence of equol (a protective substance made from the breakdown of isoflavones that only some women can produce) may be needed for isoflavones to effectively reduce hot flashes. Despite these results, the study authors did not offer a confident conclusion on the use of isoflavone supplements due to variations in study design and length; differences in the types and dosages of supplements; and the small sample sizes and high drop-out rates.
This area needs further research as questions remain about a possible benefit of soy. Results are conflicting, potentially due to variation in the types of soy preparations used, the quantities given, and for how long they are used.
Phytoestrogens don‚Äôt always mimic estrogen. In some tissues and in some people, they may block the action of estrogen. If soy‚Äôs estrogen-blocking action occurs in the breast, then eating soy could, in theory, reduce the risk of breast cancer because estrogen stimulates the growth and multiplication of breast and breast cancer cells. Studies so far have not provided a clear answer. Some have shown a benefit with soy consumption and breast cancer while others show no association. [14-17] It appears that the effects of soy may vary depending on menopausal status, the age at which soy is consumed, and type of breast cancer.
In animal and cell studies, high dosages of isoflavone or isolated soy protein extracts tend to stimulate breast cancer growth. [18,19] However, studies that observe people consuming soy foods over time show either a protective or neutral effect. Women from Asian countries appear to receive greater protective benefit from breast cancer with high soy intakes than American and European women, but this may simply be a difference in the amount of soy consumed. [20,21] Asian women may have higher levels of equol, a substance metabolized from the isoflavone daidzein by bacterial flora in the intestines. [22] Equol is believed to block potentially negative effects of human estrogen, but not all women possess the bacteria needed to create equol. [23] It is estimated that 30-50% of all humans are able to produce equol. [24] Eating soy foods starting at an early age (such as those found in many traditional Far East Asian diets) may be why women from some countries find greater benefit from soy foods than others. [19] However, the overall evidence on equol and cancer risk is unsettled. [25]
The Shanghai Women‚Äôs Health Study which followed 73,223 Chinese women for more than 7 years has been the largest and most detailed study of soy and breast cancer risk in a population with high soy consumption. [26] In this study, women who ate the most soy had a 59% lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer compared with those who ate the lowest amounts of soy. There was no association with postmenopausal breast cancer. Risk was 43% lower when soy was eaten during adolescence. Seven years later, the study authors published a follow-up analysis from the same cohort over 13 years to evaluate any association between soy foods and specific types of breast cancer defined by hormone receptors and by menopausal status (Estrogen [ER] +/-; Progesterone [PR] +/-). [27] Key highlights of the study:
The Breast Cancer Family Registry was a prospective study following 6,235 women for 9 years diagnosed with breast cancer and living in the U.S. and Canada; intake of soy isoflavones was examined in relation to deaths from all causes. [28] Key highlights of the study:
Another prospective study followed 1,954 American women who were breast cancer survivors for six years. [29] Key highlights of the study:
Prospective studies also find soy foods to be protective from breast cancer deaths:
However, randomized controlled trials do not show an effect of soy foods on risk factors for breast cancer:
The incidence of prostate cancer is highest in Western countries and lowest in Asian countries, where soy foods are a regular part of the daily diet. In addition, observational studies have found an increased risk of prostate cancer in Chinese and Japanese men who move to Western countries and adopt a Western diet, but not in those who continue eating a traditional diet. [33] Soy isoflavones, specifically genistein and daidzein, are incorporated in prostate tissue and may act as weak estrogens and inhibit the development of prostate cancer. [34]
In a meta-analysis of 30 case-control and cohort studies from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China, intakes of total soy foods, genistein, daidzein, and unfermented soy foods were associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. [34]
A review of eight randomized controlled trials examined the effects of soy in men with or at risk of developing prostate cancer. Two of these studies found that isoflavone supplements or dietary soy protein reduced the risk of prostate cancer in men at high risk of developing the disease. However, none of the studies found a significant effect on prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, a protein produced by the prostate gland that is used to detect prostate cancer. There were no adverse effects reported with soy supplementation. The authors discussed limitations of the review including the small number of participants, the short duration of studies (less than one year), and variation in dosages and types of soy given. [33]
A small randomized controlled trial in 2021 examined if soy protein supplements could slow down or reverse rising PSA levels in men who had previously been diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer, but who had a recurrence (as evidenced by rising PSA levels). The study found that even though the soy protein supplements increased blood levels of genistein, there was no effect of the supplement versus placebo on PSA levels when given for 6-8 months. [35]
Fermented soy foods commonly eaten in East Asian diets, including natto, tempeh, soy paste, and soy sauce, contain isoflavones and also bacteria that might have benefits for neurological disorders including cognitive decline, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), and Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD). Soy‚Äôs antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects may reduce the oxidative stresses associated with AD and PD. [36] Animal studies have suggest that soy compounds can weaken the progression of AD and prevent nerve cell death. They also find that soy can reduce inflammation and excess free radical production in the brain. AD has been associated with decreased levels of beneficial anti-inflammatory bacteria while harboring increased levels of proinflammatory bacteria. ¬†Fermented soy foods are produced with beneficial bacteria like Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Bacillus species that produce butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that regulates immune function and is being investigated for its protective effects on the brain.
Long-term low levels of estrogen the occur in menopausal women can reduce the number of estrogen receptors in the brain that are necessary for specific cognitive functions like memory and learning. [37] The soy isoflavone, daidzein, has been hypothesized to reduce decline in cognitive function or disease processes related to cognition and behavior. Thus, the possibility has been raised that eating soy foods might help prevent age-related memory loss or decline in thinking skills. [38]
Studies in humans, however, are not conclusive on soy‚Äôs effects on the brain:
One large study in men found a detrimental effect on cognitive function. In a prospective cohort study of more than 3,700 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii, those with the highest intakes of tofu (eaten almost daily) at midlife ages had greater cognitive impairment and brain atrophy in late life compared with men with the lowest tofu intakes (almost never eaten). [44] However, the actual number of men eating very high amounts of tofu was small, and past dietary information was collected by relying on the participants‚Äô memory, some of whom may have already experienced cognitive decline. Because of this, the researchers stated that the findings were too preliminary to make recommendations. [45]
A meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials found that although soy supplements raised thyroid stimulating hormone levels slightly, they did not have any effect on actual thyroid hormone production. [46] However, another study found that soy may interfere with thyroid hormone medication used to treat hypothyroidism. In one randomized double-blinded trial, 60 patients with a mild form of hypothyroidism (called subclinical hypothyroidism) were given low or high-dose phytoestrogen supplements (both also contained 30 grams of soy protein), the amount that might be obtained from a vegetarian diet. [47] Risk of developing clinical hypothyroidism was increased in the higher phytoestrogen group (no effect in the lower phytoestrogen group). The authors suggested that female vegetarian patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may need more careful monitoring of thyroid function. However, the authors also found a benefit on of reduced cardiovascular risk factors in the high phytoestrogen group, with a significant reduction in insulin resistance, inflammatory markers, and blood pressure. The effect of soy on thyroid function needs further examination.

üîó Dietary linoleic acid and risk of coronary heart disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2014/11/05/dietary-linoleic-acid-and-risk-of-coronary-heart-disease/

Swapping saturated fat and carbohydrates for linoleic acid ‚Äì the mainpolyunsaturated fatfound in vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds ‚Äì lowers risk of coronary heart disease, according to anew studyby Harvard School of Public Health researchers.
We talked to lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist and Takemi fellow in the Department of Nutrition, about the study to find out more.
1. Your research shows that by reducing the amount of saturated fat and carbohydrates we eat, and replacing those calories with foods rich in linoleic acid ‚Äì such as vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds ‚Äì we can reduce our risk of developing coronary heart disease. What‚Äôs so special about linoleic acid? And should consumers focus on reducing saturated fat and carbohydrates equally, or should we reduce one more than the other?
Replacing either saturated fat or carbohydrate with vegetable oils and seeing significant benefits indicates that reduction in saturated fat or carbohydrate is not the only reason for the beneficial effects of linoleic acid. Instead, linoleic acid itself plays a special role in support ofheart health. Randomized clinical trials have shown that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid reduces total and LDL cholesterol. There is also some evidence that linoleic acid improves insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.
2. Lately there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about healthy and unhealthy fats, with saturated fat being debated in the media. What can readers learn from your research about polyunsaturated versus saturated fats?
Our¬†data provide strong support that substituting vegetable oils rich inpolyunsaturated fatfor saturated fat is beneficial for the prevention of coronary heart disease. The currentdebateabout the role saturated fat misses an important point: the replacement nutrient. If saturated fat is replaced bycarbohydrates(typically refined carbohydrates), there will be no benefit on heart disease. This is why many epidemiologic studies have failed to observe a significant association between saturated fat and risk of CHD as carbohydrates were typically used as a comparator. However, if saturated fat is replaced by polyunsaturated fat, then there is a clear benefit for heart disease prevention.
3. Is there a certain amount of linoleic acid consumers should aim to eat each day? What are the best sources?
Consistent with the American Heart Association guidelines, our data continue to support consumption of 5-10% energy intake from linoleic acid* to decrease CHD risk. Linoleic acid is the predominant n-6polyunsaturated fatty acid(PUFA) in the Western diet and we can obtain it from vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower, soybean, corn, and canola oils as well as nuts and seeds. A table spoon of soybean or corn oil contains about 7-8 g of linoleic acid, and 7 shelled walnuts provide about 11 g of linoleic acid. It should be noted that important sources of linoleic acid such as soybean and canola oils and walnuts also contain substantial amounts of alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid.
*For example, for a 2,000 calorie diet that would equal 100-200 calories from linoleic acid.
4. Your study also addresses claims that linoleic acid is pro-inflammatory. Can you explain what you found when you researched this?
Concerns have been raised about higher linoleic acid consumption being harmful for heart health because of potential pro-inflammatory and thrombogenicproperties. Linoleic acid can be elongated to arachidonic acid and subsequently synthesized to a variety of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which may increase CHD risk. But this speculation is not supported by randomized controlled feeding studies, in which dietary intake of linoleic acid was not found to increase plasma levels of arachidonic acid or inflammatory markers. On the contrary, some studies have found anti-inflammatory effects of diets higher in linoleic acid compared to those higher in saturated fat.
5. Based on this new study, what are some simple steps consumers can take to improve their diet?
Instead of using butter, cream, lard, and other animal fat as the primary source of culinary fat, one shoulduse liquid vegetable oilslike soybean, corn, olive, and canola oils for cooking, on salad and at the table. Although olive oil contains little linoleic acid, many studies have shown health benefits ofMediterranean dietsrich in olive oil. Nuts and seeds are also excellent sources of healthy fats.

üîó Probiotics for Gut Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/probiotics/

Probiotics‚Äîwhether from food or supplements‚Äîare a hot topic of consumer interest. However, would a relatively healthy person benefit from supplementation of probiotics, or is a fiber-rich diet sufficient for cultivating a robust gut microbiome? Learn more about probiotics, and review available research on supplements and health.
Probiotics are dubbed the ‚Äúgood gut bugs‚Äù that live in our digestive tract. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes that make up what we callthe gut microbiome. Each person‚Äôs microbiome is different, influenced by what we eat, our lifestyle habits, our genes, and environment. Although studies have shown that the types and amounts of gut bugs differ between healthy individuals and those with disease, and that many health experts believe that a diversity of bacteria in the colon is beneficial, what a healthy gut microbiome looks like is still unknown, as it would likely vary from person to person.
However, there are known probiotics that live in the human intestine, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium. TheWorld Health Organization defines probioticsas ‚Äúlive microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.‚ÄùEarly research on probioticsused nonharmful bacteria to change or replace intestinal microbes in patients who had intestinal disorders or diarrhea.
Prebiotics consist of non-digestible fermentable carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics. An example is oligofructose naturally found in wheat, onions, banana, garlic, leeks, and chicory root or inulin. The fermentation of prebiotics by gut bacteria may help increase the amount of beneficial bacteria strains in the colon, prevent the growth of potential pathogens, reduce constipation, support healthy immune function, and lower blood cholesterol levels.
Synbioticsare supplements that contain a mix of probiotics and prebiotics, with the intention that the bacterial strains are fed and thrive in the gut.Postbioticsare the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù made by gut bacteria after digesting prebiotic fibers, which can include beneficial short-chain fatty acids and vitamin K.
These are terms promoted by industry, as they are marketed as supplements alongside probiotics. However, at this time there is little quality scientific evidence supporting the use of prebiotic, symbiotic, and postbiotic supplements to improve health.
Probiotics can be found naturally in or added to certain foods and beverages, and are sold as supplements.
Foods that are fermented tend to contain probiotics, such as:
However, to cultivate a robust gut microbiome, rather than adding just these foods to your diet, focus on implementing a long-term dietary pattern rich in various types of fibers fromfruits, vegetables,whole grains,beans,nuts, and seeds that act as prebiotics.
Fermented foods are foods or beverages that are produced with the intentional, controlled growth of microorganisms with the conversion of food components by enzymes. Historically, fermentation was commonly used to preserve foods as it protected the food from contamination by pathogenic bacteria. It also imparts a unique taste and texture to foods created by the specific types of bacteria used. Certain foods like olives are inedible without fermentation that removes bitter compounds. Fermented foods may benefit the gut microbiome, promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, and support ahealthy immune system.
Processing of fermented foods, such as by heating, baking, or pasteurization, reduces or kills probiotics. So popular foods like sourdough bread and commercially prepared fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut do not contain probiotics unless they have been added back (the label may state ‚Äúcontains live and active cultures‚Äù). Additionally, theInternational Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics statethat the term ‚Äúprobiotic‚Äù should not be used interchangeably with ‚Äúfermented foods.‚Äù Instead, fermented foods should be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù only when there is evidence that the live microbes provide health benefits.For example, yogurt is a fermented food but should only be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù if the bacterial strains used in its production have been shown to provide health benefits.
You may be surprised to see probiotics advertised on packages of chocolate, cookies, juices, and tea as the food industry has cashed in on growing consumer interest in digestive health and probiotic supplements by conveniently including them in common foods and beverages.
Be wary ofultraprocessed foodsadvertising on front of label, ‚Äúincludes probiotics (or prebiotics) to support digestive health.‚Äù This addition may create a favorable impression of their nutritional value but does not make brownies and chips suddenly healthful. Manufacturers also tend to choose familiar-sounding bacterial strains that a consumer will recognize and be more likely to purchase.
There is overwhelming scientific evidence of the harmful health effects ofsoda and sugary drinks. While soda intake has declined, sodas containing prebiotics have surged in popularity, thanks to the inclusion ofa fiber called inulinand growing consumer interest in gut health. Inulin is naturally found in small amounts in fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, artichokes, and asparagus. But the type found in ultra-processed foods is usually extracted from chicory root and blended into sweet foods like brownies, yogurt, nutrition bars ‚Äì and now sodas. These sodas are sweetened with sugar but contain much less than traditional sodas per 12-ounces: about 4-5 grams compared with 40 grams in a cola drink. A soda lower in sugar and containing fiber, especially a fiber type that boasts ‚Äúprebiotics for gut health‚Äù is surely attractive to a consumer. However, it is unproven that the small amount of prebiotics in these sodas will truly improve gut health, and drinking more of them daily to potentially achieve gut health also drives up sugar intake. In fact, aclass action lawsuit was filed in 2024against one of these soda manufacturers due to false health claims.
The best use for these prebiotic sodas might be to replace a traditional soda if you‚Äôre trying to wean down and lower sugar intake. But they should not be viewed as a health beverage, and remember that the more you drink, the sugar will add up. Check outHealthy Drinksfor best beverage options.
In 2013, global sales of probiotic supplements was $32 billion, and ispredicted to reach $85 billion by 2027.
In 2020, the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics expanded the definition of probiotics marketed as supplements to include their genus, species, strain, alphanumeric strain designation, and commercial name. For example:
‚Ä†¬†The inclusion of this brand-name is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.
Thesupplement industryas a whole is fraught with uncertainties: the quality of products from different sources can vary, and supplement manufacturers do not always have quality control programs in place. Sometimes a probiotic supplement contains lower than the stated dose of bacterial strains or may even contain different types of strains than are listed.
The quality of probiotic supplements depends on the manufacturer.Important factors includean assurance of potency (ensuring live bacteria in the amounts listed, typically in colony-forming units [CFU] through the end of shelf-life), purity (manufacturing processes that reduce the introduction of harmful pathogens), and identity (current nomenclature used to specify the genus, species, and subspecies, if applicable, and a strain designation for each strain in the product). Live probiotics are susceptible to dying during storage, which manufacturers account for when listing the potency and CFU. Responsible manufacturers will include the dose expected at the use-by date.
There is tremendous interest in the use of probiotic supplements to treat various health conditions or for boosting immunity. As a consumer, you may see attractive claims of health benefits on supplement labels, but be wary as good-quality scientific evidence is still limited and conflicting as to which strains benefit which health conditions, effective doses, single versus multi-strain types, and an optimal length of time to use them. It can be difficult to disentangle scientific evidence from enticing marketing claims.
Probiotic supplements are backed by a billion-dollar industry that often funds published research that shows positive findings about their specific bacterial strain(s). Even if studies, particularly meta-analyses, do not show author disclosures of conflicts of interest, this does not guarantee there are not embedded financial ties. Do not be surprised if your physician or health care practitioner does not recommend probiotic supplements, which is based on low-quality evidence on their efficacy.
Due to lack of high-quality evidence and a largely unregulated supplement industry, buyer beware should be heeded. TheAmerican Gastroenterological Association released practice guidelines in 2020on probiotic supplements to manage gastrointestinal disorders, and concluded only a few conditions in which they may benefit.They determined that drawing conclusions on probiotic research is difficult due to studies including different strains of microbes used, different doses, and different routes of administration, as well as differences in how the study was conducted and including only small numbers of patients followed for short periods.
That said, research is ongoing and some people find benefit in taking probiotic supplements for specific conditions in the short-term. Multi-strain types (more than one bacterial strain in the supplement) have not necessarily been found more effective than single-strain types. The following conditions have shown low-quality evidence for probiotic use:
As a rule, always discuss supplement use, including probiotics, with your doctor.
There are several species of microbes such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that are naturally found in the human colon and considered to be safe (not pathogenic). However, people who have weakened immune systems, are taking immunosuppressant drugs, or have severe disease conditions should not use probiotic supplements, because in specific cases they have beenassociated with harmful overgrowth or led to health complications.
Probiotics have skyrocketed in consumer popularity. However, there is often industry funding for probiotic research, which can skew results in favor of using the supplements. Despite the hype, there exists mostly low-quality evidence for probiotic supplements. A relatively healthy person would not likely benefit from their use, and those with weakened immune systems should avoid them.
Research is ongoing, and the decision to use supplements should be preceded with caution, with an awareness that there is a level of ‚Äúmanufactured importance‚Äù created by industry. General recommendations for probiotics cannot be made, and people should not use them loosely, because each person‚Äôs gut microbiome is unique with different bacterial strains that are optimal for them.
Because the safety and effectiveness of probiotic supplements is unclear, theWorld Gastroenterology Organisation recommendsthat if clinicians advise probiotic supplements to patients, the strains, doses, and length of use should only be that of those used in human trials that were shown to be beneficial.However, most consumers and doctorsdo not have access to or the abilityto sort through probiotics research, to be able to differentiate among various probiotics products.
A safer natural way tocultivate a healthy gut microbiomeis to implement a dietary pattern that includes a variety of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes that will ‚Äúfeed‚Äù favorable gut bugs. This can include fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics.

üîó Manganese
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/manganese/

Manganese is a trace mineral that is essential to our bodies in small amounts. Because we cannot make it, we must obtain it in food or supplements. Manganese is a coenzyme that assists many enzymes involved in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and cholesterol. [1] It also assists enzymes in building bones and keeping theimmuneand reproductive systems running smoothly. [2] Manganese works withvitamin Kto assist in wound healing by clotting the blood.
Manganese is absorbed in the small intestine. Most of the mineral is stored in bone, with smaller amounts in the liver, brain, kidneys, and pancreas. Manganese levels are difficult to measure in the body as dietary intakes do not always correlate with blood levels.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 2.3 mg a day for men and 1.8 mg for women. For women who are pregnant or lactating, the RDA is 2.0 mg and 2.6 mg, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for manganese for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 11 mg daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Manganese plays a role in the metabolism ofcarbohydratesand specifically glucose. In animal studies, a manganese deficiency can impair the action of insulin and disrupt normal blood levels of glucose. However, human studies have shown mixed results on its connection with diabetes. [2] Case-control studies have shown an association of very high and very low blood levels of manganese and an increased risk oftype 2 diabetes. [3,4] Other studies have found no association at all. [5] Therefore, it is still unclear if higher manganese intakes or manganese supplementation may protect against type 2 diabetes.
Manganese assists enzymes that build bone. Animal studies show that a deficiency of the mineral can reduce bone density and the formation of bone. Human studies have been few and small in size, and have shown conflicting conclusions. [2] Some observational studies found lower blood levels of manganese in women with osteoporosis versus those without osteoporosis; other studies found no difference. There have been no clinical trials studying the effects of manganese supplementation on bone health.
Manganese is found in a wide variety of foods, from shellfish to grains to legumes, and even spices. Drinkingwatercontains small amounts of manganese.
A deficiency of manganese is very rare, and there are no groups of people known to be at risk for developing a deficiency. Therefore, symptoms showing a deficiency have not been clearly established. The absorption of manganese may decrease if eaten with iron-rich foods, as these minerals compete for the same proteins that help with their absorption in the intestines.
There are no reports of reaching toxic levels of manganese from the diet. However, there have been isolated case reports of toxicity shown in people who drank water contaminated with unusually high levels of manganese and in industrial mining and welding workers who inhaled excess amounts of manganese in dust.

üîó Oral Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/

‚ÄúThere is no health without oral health.‚Äù You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.
Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth‚Äîparticularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person‚Äôs intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body‚Äôs process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body‚Äôs immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you‚Äôre having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn‚Äôt just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

üîó Understanding Food Labels
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-label-guide/

The information on food labels is intended to help consumers become savvy about their food choices. The front, back, and sides of a package are filled with information to inform us what the food contains and to provide guidance in making healthier selections of processed foods. However, all the numbers, percentages, and sometimes complex-sounding ingredients can lead to more confusion than clarity.
This guide will help you to navigate the terminology and nutrition information on a food package to ensure that you know what you‚Äôre buying.
The Nutrition Facts label is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was first mandated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 to help consumers make quick, informed food choices. It has undergone revisions, with thelatest update released in 2016. Changes are generally based on updated scientific information and input from the public regarding ease of use.
The percent Daily Value (%DV) shows how much of a nutrient in one serving of food contributes to one‚Äôs approximate daily requirement for the nutrient. To best use the %DV, remember these simple guidelines:
For more commentary on the updated Nutrition Facts label by Harvard nutrition experts, see the article,Updated Nutrition Facts Panel makes significant progress with ‚Äúadded sugars,‚Äù but there is room for improvement.
This is the section of a food label consumers see first, which within seconds can influence their purchase. This has made it a battleground between public health advocates and food manufacturers. Food manufacturers can choose to display FOP symbols or graphics that highlight nutritional aspects of the product if they are favorable to health, such as being lower in calories or added sugar, but may leave out less favorable information such as being high in sodium or saturated fat. These graphics promote a perception of healthfulness, which can be misleading if consumers rely only on these images without reading the Nutrition Facts panel for complete information. The FDA does not closely monitor these FOP graphics. Because research has shown that ‚Äúpositive‚Äù FOP labels like health stamps or checkmarks can overrate a food‚Äôs healthfulness, public health advocates have supported initiatives for FOP ‚Äúwarning‚Äù labels (e.g., traffic lights or stop signs) to highlight nutrients that are harmful to health in excess, such as sugars and fats insweetened beveragesandultra-processed snacks. All FOP labels in the U.S. are voluntary, which allows food manufacturers to highlight or hide the nutrition information they choose to help promote or preserve sales. If warning labels became mandatory, as public health advocates propose, the pressure on manufacturers would increase to change certain products to improve their nutritional quality.
These are statements reviewed by the FDA and supported by scientific evidence that suggest certain foods or diets may lower the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 regulates these health claims, which must undergo review by the FDA through a petition process. The FDA has approved12 health claimson food labels such as the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and hypertension; fiber-containing grains, fruits and vegetables and cancer; and folic acid and neural tube defects. However, just because a food contains a specific nutrient that is associated with a decreased risk of disease does not necessarily make the food healthy as a whole. An example would be a breakfast cereal high in soluble fiber for heart health but that is also high in added sugars. Research finds that consumers believe that a food carrying a health claim is healthier than a product that does not.
These statements describe the nutrients in a food beyond what is listed on the Nutrition Facts label, intended to showcase a health benefit of the food. An example is ‚ÄúContains 100% Vitamin C.‚Äù Most terms like ‚Äúlow sodium,‚Äù ‚Äúhigh fiber,‚Äù ‚Äúreduced fat,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood source of‚Äù are regulated by the FDA, and the nutrient amounts must meetspecific guidelinesto make these claims. Also regulated are comparative terms like ‚Äúless sugar‚Äù or ‚Äúfewer calories‚Äù comparing two similar products. However, these statements can mislead consumers about their overall healthfulness. For example, a bag of potato chips may advertise that it has 40% less fat and is cholesterol-free, suggesting it is a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food, when in reality even a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù potato chip is still a high-calorie ultra-processed food offering little nutrition. Some terms are not yet regulated by the FDA such as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or ‚Äúmultigrain.‚Äù As another example, see the pros and cons of health labeling forWhole Grains.
Chile implemented the Law of Food Labeling and Advertising in 2016, comprised of mandatory front-of-package (FOP) warning labels, restrictions on child-directed marketing, and the banning of sales in schools of all foods and beverages containing added sugars, sodium, or saturated fats that exceeded set nutrient or calorie thresholds. [1] The FOP labels displayed a black stop sign that used warning words of ‚Äúhigh in‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories. Later analyses found that purchases of sweetened beverages significantly declined following the implementation of this multifaceted law that was more effective than prior single initiatives (i.e., sweetened beverages tax).
Opposition by food industries in other countries is strong toward warning labels such as these. [2] In the United States, in 2011 the FDA recommended a FOP graphic of stars or checkmarks that indicated a less healthful versus healthful food choice. [3] In response, the Grocery Manufacturers Association intercepted this project by introducing the FOP label ‚ÄúFacts Up Front,‚Äù which displays certain nutrient amounts of a processed food. There was criticism due to its voluntary nature so that manufacturers of less healthful foods could simply choose not to display it. Opposers also noted that simply listing the nutrient amounts would not necessarily help a consumer to know if it was a healthful choice if they were unsure what the amounts meant (as opposed to the FDA‚Äôs stars and checks system that provided straightforward guidance on a healthful versus less healthful choice). Regardless, soon after initiation of the Facts Up Front label, the FDA discontinued their labeling project while continuing to monitor the Facts Up Front system.
The FDA oversees the ingredients listed on food labels. A packaged food must list the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. In other words, the ingredients that weigh the most are listed first. The list may contain unfamiliar terms alongside the common ingredient names. These may be added preservatives or colors (e.g., sodium bisulfite, caramel color), thickeners or emulsifiers (e.g., guar gum, carrageenan), or the scientific names of vitamins and minerals (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol). Ingredients like added sugars may carry many alternative names but are essentially varying combinations of fructose and glucose: evaporated cane juice, high fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and turbinado sugar.
Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, eight major food allergens‚Äîmilk, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, wheat, eggs, and soybeans‚Äîare required to be listed in a ‚Äúcontains‚Äù statement near the Ingredients list if present in a food. An example would be ‚Äúcontains wheat, milk, and soy.‚Äù Advisory statements addressing cross-contamination may also be listed such as ‚Äúmay contain wheat‚Äù or ‚Äúproduced in a facility that also uses peanuts.‚Äù On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act became law, declaring sesame as the 9th major food allergen recognized in the US. Sesame will be a required allergen listing as of January 1, 2023.
Other potential allergens include gluten and color additives such as FD&C Yellow No. 5. The FDA mandates that a product containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 must identify it on the food label. The term ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù can be listed on a label if it meets a specific maximum amount of gluten as defined by the FDA.
These dates found on food products inform both the seller and consumer about the shelf-life and optimal quality of the product. They are determined by the food manufacturer‚Äôs judgment for peak quality. Foods can still be eaten safely after these dates, with the exact amount of time dependent on the food product, but the flavor and texture may begin to deteriorate. These expiration dates are not required by federal law though some states may institute their own requirements.

üîó Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 released
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2021/01/12/2020-dietary-guidelines/

The 9th edition of theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025is out, with the tagline toMake Every Bite Count. Intended for policy makers, healthcare providers, nutrition educators, and Federal nutrition program operators, the new edition has expanded to almost 150 pages, providing nutrition guidelines for even more age groups throughout the life cycle. As in theprevious edition, the Dietary Guidelines emphasize dietary patterns rather than promoting specific nutrients or foods. This allows for greater flexibility in food choices, as health benefits are achieved by consuming a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods across different food categories, rather than a few ‚Äúsuperfoods.‚Äù In addition, the Dietary Guidelines again emphasize how nutrition educators need to be aware that food choices are strongly impacted by age, race, cultural traditions, environment,food access,budget, and personal beliefs and preferences. [1]
The key players in the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern‚Äù remain unchanged from the previous edition of the Guidelines:
Dietary components to limit:
The guidelines carry over the same limits for saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, but this time include a specific age range:
While the Guidelines include dietary patterns that remain examples of healthy diets (‚ÄúHealthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealthy Vegetarian Pattern‚Äù), the dietary targets for the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Pattern‚Äù emphasize a diet relatively high in meat, eggs, and dairy foods. Dr.Walter Willett, Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said this about the new Guidelines:
In general, there was minimal change from the last edition of the Guidelines, which did include many positive suggestions. However, guidance that considers scientific evidence on specific protein sources and health, and also the environmental consequences of dietary patterns, is needed to provide Americans with advice and policies for healthy and sustainable diets. The current Dietary Guidelines fail to do this.
Like theprevious edition, the Guidelines are¬†silent on the environmental impacts of their dietary targets, which other analyses show would have serious impacts on climate change and other environmental footprints because of the relatively large amounts of meat and dairy foods recommended. [2] Along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. The production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods‚Äîand red meat (especially beef) and dairy stand out for their disproportionate impact.
Willett points out that the Guidelines‚Äô continued dairy recommendation of 3 servings¬†per day has never been justifiedby evidence for health outcomes, and the guidance for low-fat and fat-free dairy products doesn‚Äôt detail a plan for disposal of the fat naturally present in milk:
Because the disposal of dairy fat would be hugely wasteful, it would almost certainly remain in the food supply, which makes this recommendation somewhat of a fantasy. The report does appropriately mention thatsoymilk is an alternative to cow milk, but to avoid the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy food consumption at three servings per day, the majority of milk and dairy foods would need to beplant-based.
Similarly, the Guidelines also recommend lean meats, but don‚Äôt discuss the fate of cuts of meat that are not lean. Willett says that realistically,¬†they would almost certainly be consumed, ‚Äúprobably as cheap cuts and processed meats, especially by low-income groups who already experience excess rates of obesity and diabetes.‚Äù
It‚Äôs notable that the overall protein recommendation leads with ‚Äúlean meats,‚Äù which could be interpreted by consumers as including ‚Äúlean‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù cuts of bacon or other processed meats. Although further guidance clarifies that ‚Äúmost intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey) versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham, luncheon meats),‚Äù [1] this statement is buried within the chapters of the guidelines, rather than emphasized within the summarized protein recommendation. This is a particularly important distinction, since consuming healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat canlower the risk of several diseases and premature death.

================================================================================

üîó Dairy
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/dairy/

Dairy foods include a range of food and beverage products that make up classic combinations: cereal with milk, cheese and crackers, yogurt and berries, ice cream sundaes. While ice cream and cream cheese are examples of indulgent dairy foods that are viewed as every-so-often treats, a lack of clarity exists over other dairy foods that offer protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other healthful nutrients. Ischeesea healthy food? Is non/low-fatmilkandyogurtbetter for the heart than full-fat versions? Traditionally, whole milk dairy products have been viewed as the less healthful choice because of their predominant type of fat‚Äîsaturated fat.
Saturated fats were targeted in the 1970s and 1980s as potentially causing harm to health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980 recommended choosing non/low-fat dairy foods in place of full-fat versions (except for young children). In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools in the U.S. to replace whole milk with non/low-fat unflavored milk or non-fat flavored milk. Sales of low-fat and fat-free milks, yogurts, and cheeses skyrocketed despite complaints about their lack of flavor and satisfaction. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend three 1-cup (8 ounce) servings of non/low-fat milk or similar amounts of low-fat cheese, yogurt, or other dairy foods for adults and children over 9 years old to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of bone fractures. [1]
To the surprise of many, research in the 2000s defied these longstanding guidelines to suggest that full-fat dairy foods might be just as healthful as their lower-fat counterparts, provoking scientists to look more closely at all dairy products. Upon closer examination, they realized that dairy foods are not one and the same. The fermentation process required to make cheese and yogurt may impart unique health benefits as well as improved digestibility from a lower lactose content. That said,howpeople eat dairy is important to consider. Take cheese for example: is it consumed melted on fast-food burgers, pasta, and pizza that are already high in refined carbohydrate, sodium, and saturated fat? Or is it served in thin wedges, eaten with fresh fruit as a snack or dessert? Another key point is frequency and amount. If people drink several glasses of low-fat milk or snack on reduced-fat cheese throughout the day, they might end up eating as much saturated fat (or more) than if they had consumed one glass of whole milk or serving of full-fat cheese.
These questions are important to consider when reviewing scientific research on dairy foods.
Dairy foods like milk, ice cream, cream, and soft cheeses like cottage and ricotta are high in lactose. Yogurt and aged cheeses are low in lactose because their production involves fermentation by natural bacteria that break down and consume the lactose. This is why some people with lactose intolerance may be able to safely consume some types of cheese and yogurt without side effects. Lactaid pills are a commercial product that contains the lactase enzyme that breaks down lactose, and can be taken before meals containing dairy to help reduce uncomfortable side effects. Lactaid milk is cow‚Äôs milk that contains the lactase enzyme so the product is very low in lactose.
The nutrients and types of fat in dairy are involved with bone health, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. Calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus are important for bone building, and the high potassium content of dairy foods can help lower blood pressure.
Studies on dairy have limitations that may be a cause of seemingly conflicting findings. In observational studies, people who consume a high amount of milk may be different from those who do not in ways that are not fully captured by statistical adjustments. Randomized clinical trials tend to be short in duration with a small number of participants, making it difficult to see possible effects of dairy intake on chronic diseases like heart disease and bone fractures that take years to develop. Thus, longer-term epidemiological studies may provide additional insights.
The recommendations for dairy foods from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 are based on short-term clinical trials that have shown that higher intakes of calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density. However, after one year the differences in bone density are not significant compared with a placebo. [2] Meta-analyses of prospective studies have not found an association of total dairy food intake and hip fracture risk. [3,4]
The effects of dairy foods are of special interest with children due to calcium and vitamin D playing an important role in bone growth. These nutrients are essential, but the critical question is the amount needed to minimize bone fracture risk.
Sometimes research looks at calcium intakes compared with calcium balance (how much calcium is eaten from foods and supplements compared with how much calcium is lost by the body). Calcium balance is positive during growing phases, such as in childhood and adolescence. Calcium balance is negative in the elderly, when the risk of bone loss increases. Studies have found that amount of calcium needed to achieve positive calcium balance varies among groups of people. Although the U.S. recommendation of about 3 cups daily of milk or dairy foods daily provides about 900-1000 mg calcium, some studies have shown that children and adults can achieve positive calcium balance with as little as 400 mg daily. [7,8]
More than half of the type of fat in dairy is saturated, which is a known risk factor forheart diseaseand the reason why the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends only non/low-fat dairy products. However, removing one type of food from the diet usually means replacing it with another. Swapping saturated fat with low-fat foods but also possibly more refined carbohydrates may help to lower LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol but can raise triglycerides, a different risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High blood levels of triglycerides can lead to hardening of the arteries.
The evidence on dairy foods and their relation totype 2 diabetesmellitus (T2DM) is inconclusive. While population studies on total dairy intake tend to show little or no association with T2DM, closer evaluations of specific foods like yogurt suggest a possible protective effect. The protein and probiotics in yogurt may help to lower blood glucose and affect gut microbiota that prevents weight gain. [13]
The types of saturated fats in dairy have also gained greater attention, as some types of saturated fatty acids in dairy are different than those in red meat, and may have a more neutral effect on blood cholesterol.¬† A study of 3,333 adults from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and Health Professional‚Äôs Follow-up Study assessed the participants‚Äô blood levels of various dairy fatty acids. [16] It found that higher blood levels of these saturated fatty acids were associated with less incidents of T2DM. However, it is possible the metabolic abnormalities that precede the diagnosis of T2DM by many years may have affected the blood levels of these fatty acids.
It has been speculated that although full-fat dairy contains more calories and fat than reduced-fat dairy, full-fat versions may taste better and be more filling. This in turn might prevent extra snacking between meals or even eating less over the course of a day. However, randomized clinical trials have not shown an overall effect of dairy foods on weight loss or body weight changes. [17] In a large prospective study of three cohorts of men and women, intakes of low-fat and whole milk and cheese had no association with weight changes, though yogurt in the diet was associated with less weight gain over time.[18]
The fat in dairy foods contains estrogenic hormones that are associated with a higher risk of some hormone-related cancers. High amounts of dairy foods in the diet have been associated with certain cancers, including endometrial and prostate, but with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for breast cancer have not been consistent [8].
The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day). 250 grams is about one (8-ounce) cup ofmilk,yogurt, or equivalent amounts ofcheese(because milk is about 90% water, this amounts to about 1 oz of hard cheese). If everyone were¬† to consume 2 servings of dairy per day, climate change would be difficult to control. [26]
Both full-fat and non/low-fat dairy foods can be good sources of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin D. Dairy foods that undergo fermentation, such asyogurtandsome cheeses, are lower in lactose and contain healthful gut bacteria that may benefit digestive health. However, the nutrients inmilkcan be found in other foods and therefore it is not an essential food even for the normal growth and development in children and for the prevention of health conditions like bone fractures.
Although full-fat dairy foods are high in saturated fat, whether full-fat dairy is more harmful (or more beneficial) to health than non/low-fat dairy will depend on the sources calories that replace the dairy fat. If this is sugar there may be little difference, but if this is unsaturated fat (such as in nuts or plant oils), the lower fat version would be better. The total amount of dairy consumption is also important; at only one serving per day, the amount of fat would not be important, whereas it would with 3 or more servings per day. Thus, while more research emerges, the type of dairy one incorporates into their dietary pattern can be a matter of personal preference. Some people enjoy using non-fat milk in their cereal or eating a low-fat Greek yogurt. Others may find that choosing a richer full-fat yogurt as an afternoon snack works well to prevent extra snacking before dinner. The overall dietary pattern is key, andcreating a balanced plateallows for 0 to 2 servings daily of dairy (of any type) can be healthy.

üîó Milk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/milk/

Milk is the liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals, including humans. Breast milk is the preferred food for infants, as it is well-tolerated while their digestive tracts develop and mature.Dairymilk may be introduced at later ages if tolerated well. Although dairy milk may come from any mammal, cows, goats, buffalo, and sheep are common producers.This section will focus on dairy milk from cows, and briefly discuss non-dairy plant milk alternatives.
Whole cow‚Äôs milk contains about 87% water. The remaining 13% contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Processing techniques remove fat to produce lower fat varieties: ‚Äúreduced fat‚Äù contains 2% milkfat, ‚Äúlowfat‚Äù contains 1% milkfat, and ‚Äúnonfat‚Äù or ‚Äúskim‚Äù has virtually no milkfat. Cows are often pregnant while they are milked, so dairy milk contains hormones like insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), estrogens, and progestins. Some cows are given additional hormones to increase milk production.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends including three 8-ounce servings of milk daily (or equal portions of other dairy foods like cheese or yogurt), which is justified to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Marketing efforts such as the iconic ‚ÄúGot Milk?‚Äù campaign with celebrities donning milk mustaches spread this message as well. However, research has not shown a consistent benefit on bone health with high intakes of milk, and furthermore has suggested potential harm with certain conditions like prostate cancer. [1]
Research on milk often produces contrary findings. Some reasons may be the wide range of different nutritional qualities in milk and how milk intake is measured, as seen in the following factors:
The connection of milk andcardiovascular disease(CVD) is unclear. Whole milk contains saturated fat, which is known to increase total cholesterol, raising both LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù and HDL ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol levels. However, the minerals in milk, specifically calcium and potassium may help to control blood pressure.
Comparison of milk with other foods in the diet can affect study results. For example, if comparing milk with high saturated fat meats, milk may show no difference in heart health. However, if dairy fat in milk is compared with unsaturated plant oils, nuts, or seeds, milk may appear to increase CVD risk.
Milk contains nutrients important for bone health: calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein. However, an association with milk intake and decreased hip fractures has not been made.
Interestingly, the countries with the highest intakes of milk and calcium have the highest hip fracture rates. [8] Yet it‚Äôs unclear that milk alone is responsible because these studies are epidemiological and find associations rather than direct causes. It is known that higher milk intake tends to increase height, and a taller height is strongly related to fractures of the hip and other bones, particularly in men. [9]
Two meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies did not find an association between milk intake and risk of hip fractures. [10, 11] This result was found even with high milk intakes of 3-4 glasses a day.
Although it is believed that high calcium intakes at preadolescent and adolescent years may protect against bone loss later in life, studies have not supported this. The Recommended Daily Allowance for calcium in the U.S. for preadolescents ages 9-13 years is 1300 mg daily, but the calcium recommendations in other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom are only on average 750 mg daily. Drinking three servings of milk daily for 18 months in adolescent boy and girls with a low calcium intake did not effect bone mass. [12] For further nutritional guidance for children and adolescents, visit Harvard‚ÄôsKid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Plate.
Contrary to widespread belief, research does not support that milk helps with weight control. Although a meta-analysis of 29 randomized controlled trials found that milk and other dairy foods were beneficial for body fat reduction in the short-term and if calories were restricted, no benefits on body weight were seen in the long-term and when calories were not restricted. [13] A later meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials found similar beneficial effects of dairy intake on body weight and body fat when calories were limited, but without a calorie restriction, weight gain was likely. [14]
A large study of more than 12,000 adolescents looked to see if total milk helped to prevent weight gain. It found that dairy fat was not associated with weight gain, but a high intake of low-fat milk (more than 3 servings daily) was associated with weight gain and higher body mass index, mainly from the extra calories obtained. [15]
The association of milk anddiabetesis unclear. Dairy foods are associated with a moderately lower risk of type 2 diabetes in cohort studies, but the benefit mainly appears with eating fermented milk products like yogurt rather than from milk. [16, 17] Although the action of yogurt in benefiting diabetes is unclear, it contains helpful bacteria that may reduce inflammation or improve the action of the body‚Äôs natural insulin.
Higher milk intake is associated with increased incidence of prostate cancer. The Physicians‚Äô Health Study of 21,660 men found that an intake of more than 2.5 servings of dairy foods daily (compared with a half or less serving daily) was associated with a 12% increased risk prostate cancer. In men who consumed 1 or more servings of milk daily (compared with rarely consumed), skim milk was associated with an increased risk of early stage prostate cancer, and whole milk was associated with fatal advanced prostate cancer. [18]
A meta-analysis of 111 cohort studies by the World Cancer Research Fund found a decreased risk of colorectal cancer with higher milk intake but mostly in men. This is possibly due to the high calcium content in milk, a mineral found to be protective of colorectal cancer. [19]
Bottom line:The health benefits of dairy foods appear to be stronger for fermented types likeyogurt, which play a role in thegut microbiome. Milk possesses several individual nutrients that can affect blood pressure and bone health, but some of their health-promoting effects may be weakened by whole milk‚Äôs high saturated fat content. Although popular media articles have speculated that whole milk is not less healthful than skim milk, research has not supported this statement in regards to diabetes and heart disease, and a high intake of any type of milk can lead to weight gain due to the extra calories.
The name A2 milk may sound like a futuristic space food, but it is a type of milk now sold in some stores. A1 and A2 are two types of gene variants of casein, a protein in cow‚Äôs milk. The digestion and breakdown of casein produces a peptide (BCM-7) that has been associated with inflammation, digestive discomfort, and even some chronic diseases. [20] Some animal studies have shown that A1 milk has 4 times the amount of BCM-7 than A2 milk. Certain cattle breeds possess more of the A1 gene variant than A2, and visa versa. [20]
Through epidemiological studies and animal studies, a high intake of A1 casein has been associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease, increased incidence of type 1 diabetes, and some neurological disorders such as autism. [21]
However, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a summary report after conducting a review of the literature. Some of their findings:
A2 milk distributers market their product as beneficial for adults, children, and infants who experience milk intolerances, whether from milk allergy or lactose intolerance. Symptoms of these conditions include gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea. However, it is noted that the majority of clinical trials comparing A1 with A2 milk, with findings showing improved tolerance and less gastrointestinal side effects with A2 milk, are funded by the A2 Corporation, producer of the brand ‚Äúa2 Milk‚Äù that is sold worldwide.
Bottom line:although milk with the A2 gene variant may be metabolized differently in the body than A1 milk, there is not enough evidence from research to show that these differences significantly affect health. If one has lactose intolerance or a milk allergy causing unpleasant symptoms, A2 milk may be tried. Plant-based milks are another option as they do not contain lactose or the milk protein casein.
Although fans of raw milk believe it tastes better and offers more nutrients than processed milk, raw milk is not pasteurized and may harbor harmful bacteria includingSalmonella, ListeriaandE. coli. Currently, twenty states prohibit the sale of raw milk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness than illnesses related to pasteurized dairy products. Between 1993 and 2006 more than 1,500 people in the U.S. became ill from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. [22] Raw milk and soft cheeses made from raw milk like Brie, Camembert, Queso Blanco, and Queso Fresco are especially dangerous for older adults, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and children. In pregnant women,Listeriacan cause miscarriage, or illness or death of a fetus or newborn.
The production ofdairy foodsplaces considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day), which is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk.
Milk is often sold in cartons or opaque containers because too much exposure to light can cause a loss of vitamin A and B2. Choose a carton with the latest sell-by or use-by date (indicating it is the freshest). Most milk sold in supermarkets is pasteurized and homogenized, processing techniques that use heat to kill most of the bacteria present and break down fat molecules so that texture of milk remains smooth and creamy.
*Some sugars are created in the processing of oats to make oat milk, which are listed as ‚Äúadded sugars‚Äù even if no other sweeteners are added.
Milk requires refrigeration at a temperature below 40 F. If it has been stored at room temperature for two hours or longer, it is recommended to discard it. Although pasteurization kills much of the bacteria in milk, any remaining bacteria can grow quickly in milk at room temperature or warmer. Once milk is opened, it will last about 3-5 days after the sell-by date on the label. Spoiled milk has a strong, sour odor and lumpy texture caused by excess bacteria producing lactic acid, which curdles the protein in milk and produces off odors.
Store milk towards the rear of the refrigerator rather than the front or side shelf door, where the temperature varies the most. Don‚Äôt forget to close the carton or recap the bottle to prevent the milk from absorbing the odors and flavors of other foods in the refrigerator.
Lactose-free milk undergoes pasteurization and the addition of an enzyme lactase, which breaks down the milk sugar lactose, so it generally lasts longer than regular milk. If refrigerated properly, lactose-free milk can last about 7 days after the sell-by date once it is opened.
Milk is not just for drinking by the glass or splashing onto cold cereal. Adding milk to foods can boost one‚Äôs intake of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and other nutrients.
Several other animals produce milk including sheep, goat, and yaks. These types of milk are more popular in European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries than in the U.S. Sheep‚Äôs milk can be made into various cheeses like feta and ricotta, and goat‚Äôs milk produces a popular cheese called goat cheese or chevre.
How do they compare nutritionally? Sheep, goat, and yak milks contain about the same if not more calcium than cow‚Äôs milk. The amount of protein and carbohydrate are about the same. They all contain some lactose but less than found in cow‚Äôs milk, so they may be easier to digest for people with lactose sensitivity.

üîó Calcium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/

Calcium is a mineral most often associated with healthy bones and teeth, although it also plays an important role in blood clotting, helping muscles to contract, and regulating normal heart rhythms and nerve functions. About 99% of the body‚Äôs calcium is stored in bones, and the remaining 1% is found in blood, muscle, and other tissues.
In order to perform these vital daily functions, the body works to keep a steady amount of calcium in the blood and tissues. If calcium levels drop too low in the blood, parathyroid hormone (PTH) will signal the bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. This hormone may also activate vitamin D to improve the absorption of calcium in the intestines. At the same time, PTH signals the kidneys to release less calcium in the urine. When the body has enough calcium, a different hormone called calcitonin works to do the opposite: it lowers calcium levels in the blood by stopping the release of calcium from bones and signaling the kidneys to rid more of it in the urine.
The body gets the calcium it needs in two ways. One is by eating foods or supplements that contain calcium, and the other is by drawing from calcium in the body. If one does not eat enough calcium-containing foods, the body will remove calcium from bones. Ideally, the calcium that is ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from the bones will be replaced at a later point. But this doesn‚Äôt always happen, and can‚Äôt always be accomplished just by eating more calcium.
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium for women 19-50 years of age is 1,000 mg daily; for women 51+, 1,200 mg. For pregnant and lactating women, the RDA is 1,000 mg. For men 19-70 years of age, the RDA is 1,000 mg; for men 71+ years, 1,200 mg. [1]
The reviews below specifically looked at the effect of calcium on various health conditions. Scroll down for links to more information on the health effect of specific foods rich in calcium.
Several literature reviews on the topic of total calcium intake, from food and supplements, and blood pressure have suggested a possible link to lowering high blood pressure. However, problems with study designs in these analyses (small numbers of participants, differences among the people studied, and various biases in the types of studies included) prevent a new recommendation for the treatment of high blood pressure that would increase calcium intake above the Recommended Dietary Allowance. [2] Larger trials with longer duration are needed to clarify whether increased calcium intakes or the use of calcium supplements can lower high blood pressure.
Some research has raised concerns about calcium supplements andheart health. These studies found that taking calcium supplements increased the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women. It has been suggested that high-dose supplements can cause hypercalcemia (toxic level of calcium in the blood) that can cause blood to clot or the arteries to harden, leading to cardiovascular disease. The connection is not yet clear, but a clinical guideline published after review of the available research from the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology stated that calcium from food or supplements has no relationship (beneficial or harmful) to cardiovascular disease in generally healthy adults. The guideline advises people not to exceed the Upper Limit for calcium, that is, 2,000-2,500 mg daily from food and supplements. [3]
Calcium is one of the most important nutrients required for bone health. Bone is living tissue that is always in flux. Throughout the lifespan, bones are constantly being broken down and built up in a process known as remodeling. Bone cells called osteoblasts build bone, while other bone cells called osteoclasts break down bone if calcium is needed. In healthy individuals who get enough calcium and physical activity, bone production exceeds bone destruction up to about age 30. After that, destruction typically exceeds production. This is sometimes called ¬†‚Äúnegative calcium balance,‚Äù which can lead to bone loss. Women tend to experience greater bone loss than men later in life due to menopause, a condition that lowers the amount of hormones that help to build and preserve bone. Getting enough dietary calcium at all ages may help to slow the degree of bone loss, but calcium intakes at any level are not known to completely prevent bone loss. [4] Calcium is less easily absorbed at later ages, and therefore eating a very high amount of calcium will not always resolve the problem. Studies on calcium intake and bone density in postmenopausal women have mixed results. Possible reasons:
Because the results of some large trials found that higher calcium intakes (usually achieved with a supplement) was associated with improved bone density and slightly lower risk of hip fractures, the RDA for calcium for postmenopausal women is higher than at younger ages. [5] Some studies suggest that frail elderly (80 years and older living in institutions) may benefit from supplementation more than ‚Äúyounger‚Äù elderly who live independently in the community. [6]A 2018 review of randomized controlled trials by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find that supplements with calcium and vitamin D taken for up to 7 years reduced the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women. These women did not have osteoporosis or a vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study and lived independently in the community. The amount of calcium of the supplements ranged from 600-1,600 mg daily. [7]
Epidemiological studies following people over time suggest a protective role of high calcium intakes (whether from food and/or supplements) from colorectal cancer. [8] However, randomized controlled trials using calcium supplements, with our without vitamin D, have shown mixed results. One reason may be a fairly short duration. Due to higher cost and difficulty with continued compliance from participants, clinical trials tend to be shorter in duration than epidemiological studies. But colorectal cancer can take 7-10 years or longer to develop, during which these trials might not reflect any changes in the colon.
After a review of both cohort and clinical studies by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research, they reported strong evidence that calcium supplements of more than 200 mg daily and intake of high-calcium dairy foods will likely decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. [11] They noted possible causes including the ability of calcium to bind to certain toxic substances in the colon and prevent the growth of tumor cells. Certain bacteria in dairy foods may also be protective against the development of cancerous cells in the colon. [12]
At one time, experts recommended that people with kidney stones limit their calcium intake because the mineral makes up one of the most common types of stones, called calcium-oxalate stones. What we know now is the reverse‚Äîthat not eating enough calcium-rich foods can increase the risk of stone formation. Research from large trials including the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative and the Nurses‚Äô Health Study found that a high intake of calcium foods decreased the risk for kidney stones in women. However the same effect is not true with supplements, as calcium in pill form was found to increase risk. [13,14] A benefit of calcium-rich foods (mainly from dairy) on the prevention of kidney stones was found in a cohort of 45,619 men. Intakes of skim or low-fat milk and cottage cheese or ricotta cheese showed the greatest protective effect. Men who drank two or more 8-ounce glasses of skim milk a day had 42% less risk of developing kidney stones as compared with men who drank less than one glass a month. Eating two or more half-cup servings of cottage cheese or ricotta cheese a week was associated with 30% less risk of kidney stones as compared with men who ate less than one serving a month. It is believed that calcium-rich foods reduce the formation of stones by lowering the absorption of oxalates, which make up calcium-oxalate stones. However, other undetermined components of dairy foods may also be responsible for the decreased risk. [15]
Calcium is widely available* in many foods, not just milk and otherdairy foods. Fruits, leafy greens, beans, nuts, and some starchy vegetables are good sources.
Blood levels of calcium are tightly regulated. Bones will release calcium into the blood if the diet does not provide enough, and no symptoms usually occur. A more serious deficiency of calcium, called hypocalcemia, results from diseases such as kidney failure, surgeries of the digestive tract like gastric bypass, or medications like diuretics that interfere with absorption.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia:
A gradual, progressive calcium deficiency can occur in people who do not get enough dietary calcium in the long-term or who lose the ability to absorb calcium. The first early stage of bone loss is called osteopenia and, if untreated, osteoporosis follows. Examples of people at risk include:
After a diagnosis of osteoporosis, your physician may prescribe over-the-counter calcium supplements. However, there are several points to consider when using calcium supplements.
Too much calcium in the blood is called hypercalcemia. The Upper Limit (UL) for calcium is 2,500 mg daily from food and supplements. People over the age of 50 should not take more than 2,000 mg daily, especially from supplements, as this can increase risk of some conditions like kidney stones, prostate cancer, and constipation. Some research has shown that in certain people, calcium can accumulate in blood vessels with long-term high doses and cause heart problems. Calcium is also a large mineral that can block the absorption of other minerals like iron and zinc.
Symptoms of hypercalcemia:
Certain nutrients and medications may increase your need for calcium because they either lower the absorption of calcium in the gut or cause more calcium to be excreted in the urine. These include: corticosteroids (example: prednisone), excess sodium in the diet, phosphoric acid such as found in dark cola sodas, excess alcohol, and oxalates (seeAre anti-nutrients harmful?).

üîó Diet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that ‚Äúinflammation‚Äù is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by ourimmune system. When a foreign invader enters the body such as bacteria, viruses, or allergens, or an injury occurs, our immune cells act quickly. We may sneeze or cough to rid the body of an offending agent. We may feel pain and swelling at the site of a cut or injury to signal us to be gentle with this delicate area. Blood flows in rapidly, which may produce warmth or redness. These are signs that our immune system is repairing damaged tissue or fighting invaders. As healing takes place, inflammation gradually subsides.
Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state. Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body‚Äôs immune system to constantly attack cells. This sometimes occurs with autoimmune disorders like lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn‚Äôs disease. Sometimes an unhealthy lifestyle from lack of exercise, high stress, and calorie-rich diets can trigger chronic low levels of inflammation throughout the entire body, termed metaflammation. [1,2] This type of low-grade inflammation does not usually produce noticeable symptoms, but over time metaflammation can pave the pathway for chronic conditions likecardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and certaincancers(e.g., breast, colon).
Anti-inflammatory diets may be promoted for these inflammatory conditions. They include several foods that are believed to interfere with the inflammatory process, though research on its exact mechanism is not conclusive. There is no single anti-inflammatory diet plan. Generally it emphasizes eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, minimally refined whole grains, tea, coffee, herbs, spices, and oily fish. TheMediterranean dietandDASH dietare popular dietary plans that already showcase many anti-inflammatory foods.
An anti-inflammatory diet plan not only highlights specific foods and food groups but limits other foods that may contribute to metaflammation such as fatty cuts ofred meat,refined sugary foodsandbeverages, and excessalcohol.
An anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes. It suggests a variety of anti-inflammatory foods to eat daily, rather than focusing on eating one or two specific foods or nutrients. This ensures a greater variety of protective food components, some of which may work synergistically toboost immunity. These foods provide plant chemicals (phytochemicals), antioxidants, and fiber that prevent cellular stresses, inhibit inflammatory signals caused by the immune system, promote healthygut microbiota, and slow down digestion to prevent surges in blood glucose. [3] They may also favorably affect the composition of fat cells to further reduce inflammation.
Other factors aside from diet may help to control inflammation, such asexercising regularly,controlling stress, andgetting enough sleep.
Most available research focuses on foods and dietary patterns that are associated with metaflammation, which in turn helps to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Metaflammation is especially associated with Western-type dietary patterns high in processed meats, saturated fat, refined sugars, salt, and white flour while being low in fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals. [1,4] These diets also tend to be calorie-dense with a high glycemic load, potentially leading toblood sugar surges, insulin resistance, and excess weight gain. Studies have shown that Western diets are associated with increased blood markers of inflammation, though the connection may be due to a string of events rather than one direct action. [1] For example, exposure to air pollution and chronic mental stress can lead to an excess of free radicals produced in the body, which then oxidize and damage other molecules. Atherosclerosis is one condition in which these free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol particles. The actions of both oxidized LDL cholesterol and several types of immune cells form lesions and plaque in the heart arteries that can lead to ischemicheart disease(a type of heart disease caused by narrowed or partially blocked arteries). [5] A long-term diet that is high in saturated fat andcholesterolmay raise LDL levels, increasing the risk of free radical action that may promote this immune response, which partially contributes to a chronic low-level proinflammatory state.
A major cause of low-level inflammation is the build-up of fatty acids in fat tissue (and other tissues) promoted by a high-fat or high-sugar diet. This may cause fat tissue to send signals to immune cells that produce inflammation in various areas, including organs like the pancreas. An inflamed pancreas can then lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, the combination of carrying extra body fat (obesity) and eating a diet high in saturated fat and refined sugars increases the risk of cell damage because of increased immune cell activity.
An anti-inflammatory diet contains foods rich in nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals and limits foods found in a typical Western diet to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. There is also emerging research studying the effects of high-fiber plant-rich diets that support a greater diversity ofbeneficial gut microbes, which may prevent a condition called metabolic endotoxemia. This is a low-grade inflammation that occurs because of an increase in the number of endotoxins, which are believed to cause the inflammation associated with metabolic diseases likecardiovascular diseaseandtype 2 diabetes. [6,7]
The most common causes of leaky gut are drug abuse and food toxins (for example, gluten acting as a toxin in susceptible people with celiac disease). Certain nutrients, such as the amino acids glutamine and tryptophan, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease intestinal permeability by improving the tight junctions. [28]Fiberin the diet can improve the diversity of bacteria in the gut that increases production of short chain fatty acids and other beneficial metabolites, which in turn strengthens the intestinal barrier. Foods rich inprebiotics and probiotics, and probiotic supplements, are also being studied. Much more research is needed to confirm the relationship of dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions, and potential treatments.
An anti-inflammatory diet is a healthful eating plan that may help to reduce chronic low levels of inflammation that otherwise might increase the risk of various chronic diseases. Although research is limited, it may also help to lower inflammatory markers in individuals with autoimmune-type inflammation such as with rheumatoid arthritis. Popular dietary patterns that are anti-inflammatory include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and vegetarian diets. People may seek the guidance of a registered dietitian familiar with any of these dietary patterns to assist with meal planning and appropriate portion sizes. Along with the diet, it is important to incorporate other healthy lifestyle factors that positively affect the body‚Äôs immune response, such as practicingstress reduction,exercising regularly, and getting adequatesleep.

üîó Vitamin B12
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-b12/

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is naturally found in animal foods. It can also be added to foods or supplements. Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It is also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells.
Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes unbind vitamin B12 into its free form. From there, vitamin B12 combines with a protein called intrinsic factor so that it can be absorbed further down in the small intestine.
Supplements and fortified foods contain B12 in its free form, so they may be more easily absorbed. There is a variety of vitamin B12 supplements available. Although there are claims that certain forms‚Äîlike sublingual tablets or liquids placed under the tongue to be absorbed through the tissues of the mouth‚Äîhave better absorption than traditional tablets, studies have not shown an important difference. Vitamin B12 tablets are available in high dosages far above the recommended dietary allowance, but these high amounts are not necessarily the amount that will be absorbed because an adequate amount of intrinsic factor is also needed. In cases of severe vitamin B12 deficiency due to inadequate intrinsic factor (pernicious anemia), doctors may prescribe B12 injections in the muscle.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for men and women ages 14 years and older is 2.4 micrograms (mcg) daily. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 2.6 mcg and 2.8 mcg daily, respectively. [1]
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. No upper limit has been set for vitamin B12, as there is no established toxic level.¬†¬†However, some evidence suggests that supplements of 25 mcg per day or higher may increase the risk of bone fractures. [2]
Vitamin B12 is involved in the breakdown of a protein called homocysteine. High homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk ofheart diseaseand stroke as it may promote the formation of blood clots and excess free radical cells, and may impair normal blood vessel function. A lack of adequate vitamin B12 can increase homocysteine levels.
Although epidemiological studies have found that vitamin B12 supplementation can decrease homocysteine levels, they have not consistently shown a decreased risk of cardiovascular events in taking the vitamin. Therefore the American Heart Association does not advocate for the routine use of B vitamin supplements in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. [1]¬† However,¬† vitamin B12 supplements can be important for some individuals with genetic variants that lead to high homocysteine levels.
High homocysteine levels are linked with a higher incidence of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, dementia, and cognitive decline. Similar to cardiovascular disease, although the research has shown that vitamin B12 supplementation reduces homocysteine blood levels, this has not translated into reduced rates of cognitive decline. A Cochrane review onfolic acidsupplements and cognition, with or without vitamin B12, did not find a significant effect of the supplements vs. placebo on cognitive function in healthy elderly people or people with dementia. [3] Another review of 14 randomized controlled trials also did not consistent evidence of benefit with the use of vitamin B12 supplements, alone or with other B vitamin supplements, on cognitive function in people with either normal or impaired cognition. [4] These findings do not preclude a possible benefit among some individuals with low vitamin B12 levels, and more research is needed.
Food Sources
Measuring vitamin B12 in the blood is actually not the best way to determine whether someone is deficient, as some people with a deficiency can show normal B12 blood levels. Blood levels of methylmalonic acid, a protein breakdown product, and homocysteine are better markers that capture actual vitamin B12 activity. These values increase with a vitamin B12 deficiency. It is estimated that up to 15% of the general population has a vitamin B12 deficiency. [1]
Factors that may cause vitamin B12 deficiency:
Signs of deficiency may include:
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, so any unused amount will exit the body through the urine. Generally, up to 1000 mcg a day of an oral tablet to treat a deficiency is considered safe. The Institute of Medicine states ‚Äúno adverse effects have been associated with excess vitamin B12 intake from food and supplements in healthy individuals.‚Äù [1] However, it is important not to start a high-dosage supplement of any kind without first checking with your doctor.

üîó Superfoods or Superhype?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/superfoods/

‚ÄúSuperfoods,‚Äù ‚Äúpower foods,‚Äù ‚Äútop 10 foods‚Äù‚Äîdo these titles catch your attention? For those of us seeking to improve our health, the notion of a superfood can be appealing. We may imagine a powerful food with special abilities like promoting weight loss or healing disease. There‚Äôs no scientifically based or regulated definition for superfood, but generally, a food is promoted to superfood status when it offers high levels of desirable nutrients, is linked to the prevention of a disease, or is believed to offer several simultaneous health benefits beyond its nutritional value. Its inclusion in theMerriam-WebsterDictionaryconfirms its widespread use, which defines a superfood as ‚Äúa food (such as salmon, broccoli, or blueberries) that is rich in compounds (such as antioxidants, fiber, or fatty acids) considered beneficial to a person‚Äôs health.‚Äù
Where did the term superfood originate? Interestingly, not from those who formally study food, such as nutrition scientists and dietitians. The earliest recorded example may have taken place in the early 20thcentury around World War I, used as part of a food marketing strategy. The United Fruit Company initiated an enthusiastic advertising campaign to promote its major import of bananas. It published informational pamphlets includingPoints About Bananasand theFood Value of the Banana. [1] Initially the company had advertised the practicality ofbananasin a daily diet, being cheap, nutritious, easily digested, available everywhere, good when cooked and not cooked, and sealed by nature in a germ-proof package. To get people to eat more, they suggested adding bananas in cereal for breakfast, in salads for lunch, and fried with meat for dinner.
However, the popularity of the term soared after being endorsed in medical journals, due to physicians publishing their findings of a banana diet to treat conditions like celiac disease and diabetes. [2] The American Medical Association announced that bananas in a child‚Äôs diet would provide relief for celiac disease or cure it (glutenhad not yet been discovered as the true culprit). Bananas soon bore an emblem of health, and mothers made bananas a dietary staple for their children and infants even if they did not have celiac disease. The United Fruit Company included these health benefits in its promotional material and the popular press flaunted headlines about bananas, birthing the banana diet craze.
The difference in the 21stcentury is that information now spreads at viral speed so that a new superfood seems to appear on a monthly basis. The essentials are in place: scientific research on a particular food, catchy headlines from the fast-paced popular press, as well as infomercials and marketing campaigns of involved food industries.
Superfoods often translate into super sales that have created a billion-dollar industry. According to a Nielson survey, consumers are willing to pay more for foods perceived as healthy, and health claims on labels seem to help. Interestingly, foods already perceived as healthy that also carry a health claim show the greatest sales. [3] This may be due to providing added confirmation of a consumer‚Äôs knowledge about a healthful food, increasing the likelihood they will purchase it. The survey also shows that about 80% of respondents see ‚Äúfood as medicine‚Äù and eat certain foods to prevent health problems like obesity,diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. No surprise then that plant-based foods likefruits,vegetables, andwhole grains, which are generally perceived as health-promoting, often top superfoods lists.
The food industry certainly has the incentive to market a product as a superfood, which boosts sales. According to Mintel research, in 2015 there was a 36% increase globally in the number of foods and beverages launched that were labeled as a ‚Äúsuperfood,‚Äù ‚Äúsuperfruit,‚Äù or ‚Äúsupergrain,‚Äù with the United States leading those product launches. [4]Quinoaand other ancient grains,chia seeds, andkaleenjoyed consistent sales growth in 2017. ¬†A recent list of the top 13 trending ingredients based on data from food and beverage startup companies include pea protein, seaweed, ginger, turmeric, matcha,oats, barley, andchickpeas. [5]
a√ßai,almond, avocado, broccoli,cacao,chia seeds,eggs, garlic, goji,green tea,kale,kefir, mangosteen, pomegranate, salmon, seaweed, wheatgrass
Superfoods are often nutritious but it‚Äôs clear that the term is more useful for driving sales than it is for providing optimal nutrition recommendations. A downside of superfoods is that the title alone may cause people to focus on a few specific foods, blinding them to other equally nutritious options that aren‚Äôt as hyped. Variety in our diet is important not only to gain the benefit of eating a wide array of essential vitamins and minerals, but also to prevent one from eating too much (or too little) of a particular nutrient. It also keeps our meals interesting and flavorful!
So yes,explore individual foodsand learn how to select, prepare, and enjoy them‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be distracted by the latest overhyped food or fad. Instead, focus on creating a ‚Äúsuper plate‚Äù full of different healthy and flavorful foods. Need some inspiration? Check out theHealthy Eating Plateto get started.

üîó Gluten: A Benefit or Harm to the Body?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/gluten/

The quick answer is that it can be either, but it all depends on the individual.
Gluten is a protein naturally found in somegrainsincluding wheat, barley, and rye. It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a ‚Äústretchy‚Äù quality‚Äîthink of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough. Without gluten, the dough would rip easily.
Other grains that contain gluten are wheat berries, spelt, durum, emmer, semolina, farina, farro, graham, khorasan wheat, einkorn, and triticale (a blend of wheat and rye). Oats‚Äîthough naturally gluten free‚Äîoften contain gluten from cross-contamination when they are grown near, or ¬†processed in the same facilities as the grains listed above. Gluten is also sold as wheat gluten, or seitan, a popular vegan high-protein food. Less obvious sources of gluten include soy sauce and modified food starch, however gluten-free options of these products are available and labeled as such to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs gluten-free labeling rule.
Gluten is most often associated with wheat and wheat-containing foods that are abundant in our food supply. Negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet. There is little published research to support these claims; in fact published research suggests the opposite.
In a 2017 study of over 100,000 participants without celiac disease, researchers found no association between long-term dietary gluten consumption and heart disease risk. [1]¬†In fact, the findings also suggested that non-celiac individuals who avoid gluten may increase their risk of heart disease, due to the potential for reduced consumption of whole grains.
Gluten may also act as a prebiotic, feeding the ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria in our bodies. Arabinoxylan oligosaccharide is a prebiotic carbohydrate derived from wheat bran that has been shown to stimulate the activity of bifidobacteria in the colon. These bacteria are normally found in a healthy human gut. Changes in their amount or activity have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. [6,7]
What‚Äôs not great about gluten is that it can cause serious side effects in certain individuals. Some people react differently to gluten, where the body senses it as a toxin, causing one‚Äôs immune cells to overreact and attack it. If an unknowingly sensitive person continues to eat gluten, this creates a kind of battle ground resulting in inflammation. The side effects can range from mild (fatigue, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea) to severe (unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, intestinal damage) as seen in the autoimmune disorderceliac disease. Estimates suggest that 1 in 133 Americans has celiac disease, or about 1% of the population, but about 83% of them are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions. [8,9] Research shows that people with celiac disease also have a slightly higher risk of osteoporosis and anemia (due to malabsorption of calcium and iron, respectively); infertility; nerve disorders; and in rare cases cancer. [10] The good news is that removing gluten from the diet may¬†reverse the damage. A gluten-free diet is the primary medical treatment for celiac disease. However, understanding and following a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging, possibly requiring the guidance of a registered dietitian to learn which foods contain gluten and to ensure that adequate nutrients are obtained from gluten-free alternatives. Other conditions that may require the reduction or elimination of gluten in the diet include:
It is important to note that gluten is a problem only for those who react negatively to it, or test positive for celiac disease. Most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives, without any adverse side effects.
But does this side effect occur in people without a true gluten intolerance, and can the reverse be suggested in that the avoidance of gluten might sharpen the mind? A large cohort study disagrees. Almost 13,500 middle-aged women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study II without celiac disease were followed for 28 years to observe any potential links between gluten intake and mental ability. [15]No significant differences were found in cognitive scores (measuring reaction time, attention, memory, etc.) comparing women with the highest and lowest gluten intakes. The lack of association remained even after excluding women with a dementia or cancer diagnosis.
Unless a person has diagnosed celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a gluten sensitivity, current evidence does not support that eating gluten increases inflammation in the brain or negatively affects brain health.
This is essentially adiet that removes all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. However, since gluten-containing whole grains contain fiber and nutrients includingB vitamins,magnesium, andiron, it‚Äôs important to make up for these missing nutrients. Along with consuming naturally gluten-free foods in their whole form likefruits,vegetables, legumes,nuts, seeds, fish,eggs, and poultry, the following whole grains are also inherently¬†gluten-free:
It‚Äôs also key not to rely on processed gluten-free foods that may be high in calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium and low in nutrients, such as gluten-free cookies, chips, and other snack foods. Often, these foods are made with processed unfortified rice, tapioca, corn, or potato flours.
The gluten-free food industry has grown 136% from 2013 to 2015 with almost $12 billion in sales in 2015. Interestingly, studies show that people who do not have celiac disease are the biggest purchasers of gluten-free products. [11] Consumer surveys show that the top three reasons people select gluten-free foods are for ‚Äúno reason,‚Äù because they are a ‚Äúhealthier option,‚Äù and for ‚Äúdigestive health.‚Äù [12] For those who are not gluten-intolerant, there is no data to show a specific benefit in following a gluten-free diet, particularly if processed gluten-free products become the mainstay of the diet. In fact, research following patients with celiac disease who change to a gluten-free diet shows an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This could be partly due to improved intestinal absorption, but speculation has also focused on the low nutritional quality of processed gluten-free foods that may contain refined sugars and saturated fats and have a higher glycemic index.

üîó Folate (Folic Acid) ‚Äì Vitamin B9
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/folic-acid/

Folate is the natural form of vitamin B9, water-soluble and naturally found in many foods. It is also added to foods and sold as a supplement in the form of folic acid; this form is actually better absorbed than that from food sources‚Äî85% vs. 50%, respectively. Folate helps to form DNA and RNA and is involved in protein metabolism. It plays a key role in breaking down homocysteine, an amino acid that can exert harmful effects in the body if it is present in high amounts. Folate is also needed to produce healthy red blood cells and is critical during periods of rapid growth, such as during pregnancy and fetal development.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for folate is listed as micrograms (mcg) of dietary folate equivalents (DFE). Men and women ages 19 years and older should aim for 400 mcg DFE. Pregnant and lactating women require 600 mcg DFE and 500 mcg DFE, respectively. People who regularly drink alcohol should aim for at least 600 mcg DFE of folate daily since alcohol can impair its absorption.
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. The UL for adults for folic acid from fortified food or supplements (not including folate from food) is set at 1,000 mcg a day.
One of the advances that changed the way we look at vitamins was the discovery that too little folate is linked to birth defects of the spine (spina bifida) and brain (anencephaly). Fifty years ago, no one knew what caused these birth defects, which occur when the early development of tissues that eventually become the spinal cord, the tissues surrounding it, or the brain goes awry. More than 30 years ago, British researchers found that mothers of children with spina bifida had low vitamin levels. [1] Eventually, two large trials in which women were randomly assigned to take folic acid or a placebo showed that getting too little folate increased a woman‚Äôs chances of having a baby with spina bifida or anencephaly and that getting enough folate could greatly reduce the incidence of these birth defects. [2,3]
Timing of folate is critical. For folate to be effective, it must be taken in the first few weeks after conception, often before a woman knows she is pregnant. Enough folate, at least 400 mcg daily, isn‚Äôt always easy to get from food that is not fortified. That is why women of childbearing age are urged to take extra folic acid as a supplement. It‚Äôs also why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration now requires that folic acid be added to most enriched breads, flour, cornmeal, pastas, rice, and other grain products, along with the iron and other micronutrients that have been added for years. [4] Since the advent of mandatory folic acid fortification in 1998, neural tube birth defects have dropped by 28%, and studies have shown that far fewer people have low levels of folate in their blood. [5]
In 1968, a Boston pathologist investigated the deaths of two children from massive strokes. Both had inherited conditions that caused them to have extremely high levels of a protein breakdown product in their blood, and both had arteries as clogged with cholesterol as those of a 65-year-old fast food addict. [6] Putting one and one together, he hypothesized that elevated levels of this breakdown product‚Äîcalled homocysteine‚Äîwould contribute to the artery-clogging process of atherosclerosis.
How do B vitamins fit into the homocysteine picture? Folate and vitamin B12 play key roles in converting homocysteine into methionine, one of the 20 or so building blocks from which the body builds new proteins. Without enough folate,vitamin B6, andvitamin B12, this conversion process becomes inefficient and homocysteine levels increase. On the flip side, homocysteine levels drop with increasing intakes of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12.
Since these early observations about homocysteine, most but not all studies have linked high levels of homocysteine with a modest increase in risk ofheart disease and stroke. And some but not all observational studies, including the Nurses‚Äô Health Study, show lower risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and hypertension among people with higher intakes of folate from food, those who use multivitamin supplements, or those with higher levels of serum folate. [7-12] But linking higher homocysteine levels‚Äîand lower folate levels‚Äîwith heart disease risk does not necessarily mean that lowering homocysteine by taking folate and other B vitamins will lower risk. Ideally, this would be tested in randomized trials.
Several large randomized trials of B vitamin supplements to lower homocysteine levels and prevent heart disease and stroke failed to find a benefit. [13-18] These trials had similar designs: adults who had a history of heart disease or stroke, or who were at high risk of heart disease, were given a pill containing high doses of vitamins B6, B12, and folic acid or a placebo. The studies found that taking high doses of the three B vitamins lowered homocysteine levels but did not lead to a reduction in coronary heart events.
But looking at cardiovascular disease as a whole may have obscured a potential benefit of at least one of the B vitamins, and studying people who already have advanced vascular disease may be too late in the process. One analysis of multiple studies suggests that folic acid supplements can reduce the risk of stroke in people who have not already suffered a stroke, but they do not reduce the risk of second stroke in people who have already had one. [19] Folic acid supplements were most protective in studies that lasted at least three years and that combined folic acid with vitamins B6 and B12. Trials that enrolled more men than women also showed more of a benefit, perhaps because men are at higher risk of stroke in general. Ultimately, folic acid supplementation may only reduce the risk of heart disease in people who have lower levels of folate intake, most likely in countries that do not fortify their food supply with folic acid. In people who already get enough folate in their diets, further supplementation with high doses of folic acid supplements‚Äîmuch higher than what is found in a standard multivitamin‚Äîhas not been found to be beneficial and might actually cause harm.
Additional research highlights folate‚Äôs potential benefits:
Folate plays a key role in cell growth and building DNA, the complex molecule that forms our genetic blueprint. It is believed that folate may play a role in both suppressing some types of early cancer, as well as progressing established cancers if high doses of folic acid are used.
Observational studies show that people who get higher than average amounts of folate from their diets or folic acid supplements for 15 years or more have lower risks of colon cancer [25] and breast cancer. [26] This could be especially important for those who drink alcohol, since alcohol interferes with the proper metabolism of folate and inactivates circulating folate. An interesting observation from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study is that a higher intake of folate appears to blunt the increased risk of breast cancer seen among women who have more than one alcoholic drink a day. [26] Other studies have had similar findings, including one from Sweden that found that sufficient folate intake protected against breast cancer even in women who had only one drink a day or less. [27,28]
But the relationship between folate and cancer is a complicated one, especially for people at high risk of colon cancer. [29] Colorectal adenomas, or polyps, are pre-cancerous growths in the large intestine. A multiyear trial looked at whether high-dose folic acid supplements could prevent new polyps in people who had a history of polyps. [30] The study found that taking a daily pill with 1,000 micrograms of folic acid offered no protection against new polyps, and, more worrisome, increased the risk of developing multiple or more serious polyps.
Keep in mind that this study tested a high dose of folic acid, more than two times higher than what is found in a standard multivitamin; furthermore, study participants were already at a very high risk of developing new polyps. This may be another case where timing of folate intake is critical. Getting adequate folate may prevent polyps in people who do not have them, but high dose folic acid supplements may speed up polyp growth in people who do. And it is reassuring that other trials of high dose B vitamin supplementation, such as the Women‚Äôs Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study, have not found higher rates of cancer in supplement users. [31]
In the U.S., fortification itself has increased people‚Äôs daily folic acid intake, and one highly publicized study suggested that folic acid fortification might have caused a small increase in the incidence of colon cancer. [32] There is another equally plausible explanation for the increase‚Äîgreater detection of existing tumors in the colon and rectum due to more widespread use of colonoscopy. The steady decline in deaths from colon cancer before and after the onset of folic acid fortification suggests that screening, not folic acid fortification, is responsible for the uptick in colon cancer rates. The overall evidence from studies in humans shows a lower risk of colon and breast cancer with greater intake of folate or folic acid, rather than increased risk. [28, 33, 34] A study of 1,400 older adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that a significant lower risk of overall cancer incidence in those people who had the highest levels of folate biomarkers (referred to as serum and red blood cell folate). The study did not find a negative impact of the folate fortification program on cancer risk and even suggested a protective role. [35]
When teasing out the relationship between any vitamin supplement and cancer, it is important to remember that cancer cells are essentially our own cells on overdrive, growing and rapidly dividing, and they have a greater need for nutrients than most of our normal cells do. Studies done decades ago show that folate is needed for tumor cell growth. Indeed, one successful chemotherapy agent works as a folate antagonist, since rapidly dividing cells require folate to maintain their fast pace of cell division. So for people who have cancer or precancerous growths, nutritional supplements may be a double-edged sword. If you have cancer, make sure to check with your doctor before beginning any vitamin supplement regimen.
Observational studies have found an association between high homocysteine levels and increased incidence of dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. [36, 37] Homocysteine can negatively affect the brain by causing a lack of blood to the brain and nerve cells. Some observational studies have found a link between low blood levels of folate and higher risk of dementia. However, clinical trials have not found that folic acid supplementation prevents the development of dementia or improves cognitive function even if it reduces homocysteine levels. [37] More clinical trials of longer duration are needed to see the effects of folic acid supplementation and effective dosages on cognitive function.
A wide variety of foods naturally contain folate, but the form that is added to foods and supplements, folic acid, is better absorbed. In January 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required food manufacturers to add folic acid to foods commonly eaten, including breads, cereals, pasta, rice, and other grain products, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. This program has helped to increase the average folic acid intake by about 100 mcg/day. [38,39] Good sources of folate include:
A folate deficiency is rare because it is found in a wide range of foods. However, the following conditions may put people at increased risk:
Signs of deficiency can include: megaloblastic anemia (a condition arising from a lack of folate in the diet or poor absorption that produces less red blood cells, and larger in size than normal); weakness, fatigue; irregular heartbeat; shortness of breath; difficulty concentrating; hair loss; pale skin; mouth sores.
It is extremely rare to reach a toxic level when eating folate from food sources.
However, an upper limit for folic acid is set at 1,000 mcg daily because studies have shown that taking higher amounts can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency. This¬† deficiency occurs most often in older adults or those eating a vegan diet in whom a B12 deficiency is more common. Both folate and B12 are involved in making red blood cells, and a shortage of either can result in anemia. A person taking high-dosage supplements of folic acid may be able to correct the anemia and feel better, but the B12 deficiency still exists. In this case, if high folate intake continues to ‚Äúhide‚Äù the symptoms of B12 deficiency for a long time, a slow but irreversible damage to the brain and nervous system may occur. If you choose to use a folic acid supplement, stick with the lower range available of 400 mcg a day or less, as you will likely obtain additional folic acid from fortified foods like cereals and breads, as well as natural folate in food.
Overall, the evidence suggests that the amount of folic acid in a typical multivitamin does not cause any harm‚Äîand may help prevent some diseases, especially among people who do not get enough folate in their diets, and among individuals who drink alcohol.
Folate is also referred to as vitamin B9. Despite the number, there are only eightB vitaminsin total.

üîó Protein
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/protein/

Protein is an essential macronutrient, but not all food sources of protein are created equal, and you may not need as much as you think. Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods.
Jump to:‚ÄìWhat is protein?‚ÄìHow much protein do I need?‚ÄìIt‚Äôs all about the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù‚ÄìResearch on protein and human health‚ÄìProtein foods and the planet‚ÄìThe bottom line: choosing healthy protein foods‚Äì[Quiz] Test your protein knowledge!
Protein is found throughout the body‚Äîin muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.
Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don‚Äôt store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids‚Äîhistidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine‚Äîknown as the¬†essential¬†amino acids, must come from food.
The National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, orjust over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. [1]
The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake‚Äîanywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there‚Äôs relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. Individual needs will vary based on factors such as age, exercise level, health conditions, and overall dietary pattern. A registered dietitian can help determine one‚Äôs individual protein needs.
In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.
‚ÄúPure‚Äù protein, whether derived from plant or animal foods, probably has similar effects on health, although the mix of amino acids can have health implications. Some proteins found in food are ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù meaning they contain all twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein in the body. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more of the nine essential amino acids, which our bodies can‚Äôt make from scratch or from other amino acids. Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose¬†to incorporate complete plant proteins likequinoaandchia seeds.
It‚Äôs important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don‚Äôt get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreasedimmunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death.
However, it‚Äôs uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there‚Äôs an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3]
When we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It‚Äôs this protein¬†‚Äúpackage‚Äù¬†that‚Äôs likely to make a difference for health.
The table below shows a sample of food ‚Äúpackages‚Äù sorted by protein content, alongside a range of components that come with it.
To call out a few examples:
Available evidence indicates that it‚Äôs¬†the source of protein (or, the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù), rather than the amount of protein, that likely makes a difference for our health. You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here‚Äôs the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death.
Research conducted at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health has found that eating even small amounts of red meat‚Äîespecially processed red meat‚Äîon a regular basis is linked to an increased risk ofheart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. [4-6] Conversely, replacing red and processed red meat with healthy protein sources such as beans, soy foods, nuts, fish, or poultry seems to reduce these risks. One of the reasons why plant sources of protein are related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to protein from red meat and dairy is because of thedifferent types of fatin these protein packages. Plant-based protein sources are more unsaturated, which lowers LDL cholesterol‚Äîan established risk factor for heart disease. Also, plant sources contain nocholesterol. Other factors are likely to contribute to the lower risk, but this is a key factor.
In terms of theamount¬†of proteinconsumed, there‚Äôs evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet may be beneficial for the heart, as long as the protein comes from a healthy source.
Again, thesource of proteinmatters more than protein¬†quantity¬†when it comes to diabetes risk. Eating more red meat predicts a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while consuming nuts, legumes, and poultry is related to lower risk.
When it comes to cancer, once again, thesource of proteinseems to matter more than quantity.
The same healthy protein foods that are good choices for disease prevention may also help with weight control. Again, it‚Äôs thesource of proteinthat matters.
There‚Äôs no need to go overboard on protein. Though some studies show benefits of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets in the short term (such as thepaleo diet), avoiding fruits and whole grains means missing out on healthful fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients.
To give you an idea, this ‚Äúscorecard‚Äù from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken¬†and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it‚Äôs also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination.
Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods, many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein ‚Äúpackages‚Äù are created equal. Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it‚Äôs important to pay attention to what else is coming with it. That‚Äôs why theHealthy Eating Plateencourages choosing healthy protein foods.
Building off this general guidance, here are some additional details and tips for shaping your diet with the best protein choices:

üîó Vitamin A
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-a/

It‚Äôs only a semi-myth that eating carrots will help you see in the dark. A carrot‚Äôs main nutrient, beta-carotene (responsible for this root vegetable‚Äôs characteristic orange color), is a precursor to vitamin A and helps your eyes to adjust in dim conditions. Vitamin A can‚Äôt give you superpowers of night vision or cure your dependence on contact lenses, but eating an adequate amount will support eye health.
Vitamin A also stimulates the production and activity of white blood cells, takes part in remodeling bone, helps maintain healthy endothelial cells (those lining the body‚Äôs interior surfaces), and regulates cell growth and division such as needed for reproduction.
The two main forms of vitamin A in the human diet are preformed vitamin A (retinol, retinyl esters), and provitamin A carotenoids such as alpha-carotene and beta-carotene that are converted to retinol. Preformed vitamin A comes from animal products, fortified foods, and vitamin supplements. Carotenoids are found naturally in plant foods. There are other types of carotenoids found in food that are not converted to vitamin A but have health-promoting properties; these include lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin.
Vitamin A is currently listed on the Nutrition Facts label measured in international units (IU). However, the Institute of Medicine lists the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) of vitamin A in micrograms (mcg) of retinol activity equivalents (RAE) to account for different absorption rates of preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids. Under the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) new food and dietary supplement labeling regulations, as of July 2018 large companies will no longer list vitamin A as IU but as ‚Äúmcg RAE.‚Äù [1]
The evidence suggests that eating a variety of foods rich in vitamin A, especiallyfruits and vegetables, is protective from certain diseases, though the health benefit of vitamin A supplements is less clear.
Lung Cancer:Observational studies following nonsmokers and current or former smokers have found that higher intakes of carotenoids from fruits and vegetables are associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. However, three large clinical trials did not find that supplements of beta-carotene and vitamin A helped to prevent or reduce lung cancer risk. In fact, two of those three trials actually found a significant increase in lung cancer risk among study participants taking supplements with beta-carotene or retinyl palmitate (a form of vitamin A). [1] Therefore, it is recommended that current or former smokers and workers exposed to asbestos do not use high-dose beta-carotene and retinyl palmitate supplements. Additionally, based on current evidence the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises against the use of beta-carotene supplements for the prevention of any cancer, stating that there is potentially greater harm in using these supplements than any suggested benefit. [2]Prostate Cancer:Lycopene is a carotenoid that gives fruits and vegetables a pink or red hue, as in tomatoes and grapefruit. There has been interest in lycopene‚Äôs effects on cancer due to its antioxidant properties. Observational studies have noted a decreased risk of prostate cancer in men who eat high amounts of fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, studies have not provided a clear answer specific to lycopene. Observational studies and clinical trials have shown either a protective effect of lycopene-rich foods (specifically tomatoes) or supplements, or no effect. [3] A Harvard study of more than 51,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a protective effect from advanced stages of prostate cancer in those with higher intakes of tomato sauce. [4] A 2015 meta-analysis of 26 studies found that higher lycopene intakes appeared protective from prostate cancer incidence. [5] However, an FDA review stated that definite conclusions about lycopene could not be made, one reason being that accurate reporting of lycopene intake is difficult due to variations in lycopene content during cooking and storage. [6] Another was that lycopene-rich foods often contain other cancer-protective compounds, so it would be difficult to isolate any health benefits to lycopene
The randomized controlled Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) trial examines the effects of the MIND diet to prevent cognitive decline. It found that higher blood levels of alpha-carotene (a form of vitamin A that includes lutein and zeaxanthin) were associated with better cognition (e.g., memory, learning, attention) in participants at risk for cognitive decline. [7] Foods contributing to higher alpha-carotene levels included fruits, and green leafy and orange vegetables.
Age-related macular degeneration(AMD) is a common painless eye condition but a leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. It distorts the sharp, central vision needed to see fine details such as for reading and driving. The exact cause is unclear but oxidative stress is believed to play a role. Smokers and those with poor diets lacking fruits and vegetables have a higher risk of developing AMD. Lutein and zeaxanthin are two carotenoids with protective antioxidant effects that are found in the retina, the eye tissue that is damaged by AMD. Studies have looked to see if supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin, as well as beta-carotene, might be useful for preventing or treating this condition. The NIH-funded Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS, AREDS2) found that daily intakes of high-dose vitamins including vitamins C and E and lutein and zeaxanthin slowed the progression of intermediate and late-stage AMD, particularly in participants who ate the lowest amounts of carotenoids. [8,9] Beta-carotene was not found to be protective.
Many breakfast cereals, juices, dairy products, and other foods are fortified with retinol (preformed vitamin A). Manyfruits and vegetablesand some supplements contain beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, or zeaxanthin.
DeficiencyVitamin A deficiency is rare in Western countries but may occur. Conditions that interfere with normal digestion can lead to vitamin A malabsorption such as celiac disease, Crohn‚Äôs disease, cirrhosis, alcoholism, and cystic fibrosis. Also at risk are adults and children who eat a very limited diet due to poverty or self-restriction.¬† Mild vitamin A deficiency may cause fatigue, susceptibility to infections, and infertility. The following are signs of a more serious deficiency.
ToxicityVitamin A toxicity may be more common in the U.S. than a deficiency, due to high doses of preformed vitamin A (retinol) found in some supplements. Vitamin A is also fat-soluble, meaning that any amount not immediately needed by the body is absorbed and stored in fat tissue or the liver. If too much is stored, it can become toxic. The tolerable upper intake of 3,000 mcg of preformed vitamin A, more than three times the current recommended daily level, is thought to be safe. However, there is some evidence that this much preformed vitamin A might increase the risk of bone loss, hip fracture [10-12], or some birth defects. [13] Another reason to avoid too much preformed vitamin A is that it may interfere with the beneficial actions ofvitamin D. Signs of toxicity include the following.
In contrast to preformed vitamin A, beta-carotene is not toxic even at high levels of intake. The body can form vitamin A from beta-carotene as needed, and there is no need to monitor intake levels as with preformed vitamin A. Therefore, it is preferable to choose a multivitamin supplement that has all or the vast majority of its vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene; many multivitamin manufacturers have already reduced the amount of preformed vitamin A in their products. However, there is no strong reason for most people to take individual high-dose beta-carotene supplements. Smokers in particular should avoid these, since some randomized trials in smokers have linked high-dose supplements with increased lung cancer risk. [14-16]

üîó Vitamin E
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-e/

Vitamin E is a fat-solublevitaminwith several forms, but alpha-tocopherol is the only one used by the human body. Its main role is toact as an antioxidant, scavenging loose electrons‚Äîso-called ‚Äúfree radicals‚Äù‚Äîthat can damage cells. It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries. Antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin E, came to public attention in the 1980s when scientists began to understand that free radical damage was involved in the early stages of artery-clogging atherosclerosis, and might also contribute to cancer, vision loss, and a host of other chronic conditions. Vitamin E has the ability to protect cells from free radical damage as¬†well as reduce the production of free radicals in certain situations. However, conflicting study results have dimmed some of the promise of using high dose vitamin E to prevent chronic diseases.
TheRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin Efor males and females ages 14 years and older is 15 mg daily (or 22 international units, IU), including women who are pregnant. Lactating women need slightly more at 19 mg (28 IU) daily.
Vitamin E is found in plant-based oils,nuts, seeds,fruits, andvegetables.
Because vitamin E is found in a variety of foods and supplements, a deficiency in the U.S. is rare.
People who have digestive disorders or do not absorb fat properly (e.g., pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease) can develop a vitamin E deficiency.
The following are common signs of a deficiency:
There is no evidence of toxic effects from vitamin E found naturally in foods. Most adults who obtain more than the RDA of 22 IU daily are using multivitamins or separate vitamin E supplements that contain anywhere from 400-1000 IU daily. There have not been reports of harmful side effects of supplement use in healthy people. However, there is a risk of excess bleeding, particularly with doses greater than 1000 mg daily or if an individual is also using a blood thinning medication such as warfarin. For this reason, anupper limit for vitamin Ehas been set for adults 19 years and older of 1000 mg daily (1465 IU) of any form of tocopherol supplement.
Due to occasional reports of negative health effects of vitamin E supplements, scientists have debated whether these supplements could be harmful and even increase the risk of death. Researchers have tried to answer this question by combining the results of multiple studies.
Inone such analysis, the authors gathered and re-analyzed data from 19 clinical trials of vitamin E; they found a higher rate of death in trials where patients took more than 400 IU of supplements a day. While this meta-analysis drew headlines when it was released, there are limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from it. Some of the findings were based on very small studies. In some of these trials, vitamin E was combined with high doses of beta-carotene, which itself has been related to excess mortality.¬† Furthermore, many of the high-dose vitamin E trials included in the analysis included people who had advanced heart disease or Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
Other meta-analyses have come to different conclusions. So it is not clear that these findings would apply to healthy people. ThePhysicians‚Äô Health Study II, for example, did not find any difference in death rates between the study participants who took vitamin E and those who took a placebo.
An in-depth look at the research on vitamin E and health.
For a time, vitamin E supplements looked like an easy way to preventcardiovascular disease. TheU.S. Preventive Services Task Force‚Äôs 2022 reviewof evidence from clinical trials found no conclusive benefit of vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and therefore recommended against their use. Although some large observational studies and clinical trials have shown a heart-protective benefit from these supplements, particularly in relatively healthy people, most randomized clinical trials have shown no benefit in either healthy people or those at risk for, or with, heart disease.
Studies showing a heart-protective benefit:
Studies showing no heart-protective benefit:
More recent evidence introduces a theory that vitamin E supplements may have potential benefits only in certain subgroups of the general population. Atrial of high-dose vitamin E in Israel, for example, showed a marked reduction in heart disease among people with type 2 diabetes who had a common genetic predisposition for greater oxidative stress.
Taken as a whole, observational studies (Willett et al.,1984;Hunter et al., 1993;Chan et al., 1999;van Dam et al., 2000;Wu et al., 2002;Fung et al., 2003;Feskanich et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2006;Lee et al., 2006) have not found that vitamin E in food or supplements offers much protection againstcancerin general, or against specific cancers. TheU.S. Preventive Services Task Force‚Äôs 2022 reviewof the evidence from clinical trials on the efficacy of vitamin E for cancer also showed no benefit of these supplements on a decreased incidence of or deaths from any cancer.
Observational studies and clinical trials have been inconsistent, some suggesting that vitamin E supplements might lower the risk of advanced prostate cancer in smokers and a large randomized trial suggesting that vitamin E increases the risk of prostate cancer.
Investigators had hoped that the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) would give more definitive answers on vitamin E and prostate cancer. SELECT‚Äôs 18,000 men were assigned to follow one of four pill regimens‚Äîvitamin E plus selenium, vitamin E plus a selenium placebo, selenium plus a vitamin E placebo, or a double placebo‚Äîand to be tracked for 7 to 12 years. But investigators halted the study halfway through in 2008 whenearly analyses showedthat vitamin E offered no cancer or prostate cancer prevention benefit. Though the trial ended, they continued to follow the men who had participated.In 2011, researchers reporteda 17% higher risk of prostate cancer among men assigned to take vitamin E; there was no significant increased risk of prostate cancer among men who took vitamin E and selenium.
Though these results may sound worrisome, two other major trials of vitamin E and prostate cancer had quite different results:
Why were the SELECT findings on vitamin E and prostate cancer so different from those of earlier studies? Previous studies of vitamin E supplements and prostate cancer (Heinonen et al., 1998;Chan et al., 1999;Kirsh et al., 2006;Peters et al., 2007) found the greatest benefit in men who were smokers and who had more advanced cancers. In the SELECT trial, however, fewer than 10% of the men were smokers and most had early-stage cancer detected through prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood tests. Many early-stage, low-grade prostate cancers identified by PSA test would not become advanced cancers. There is also evidence that different processes may be at work in early versus late-stage prostate cancers. Alarge trial of a drug to prevent prostate cancerfound opposite effects when used in early versus advanced prostate cancers.
Bear in mind that most prostate cancer develops slowly, and any study looking at prostate cancer prevention needs to track men for a long time. By stopping the SELECT trial early, there is no way to tell if vitamin E could have helped protect against prostate cancer in some men if they had continued the trial over a longer period of time. Very few cases in the SELECT trial were of advanced prostate cancer, further limiting the interpretation of the findings.
Asix-year trial foundthat vitamin E, in combination with vitamin C, beta carotene, and zinc, offered some protection against the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but not cataracts, in people who were at high risk of the disease. On its own, however, vitamin E does not seem to offer much benefit againsteither AMDor cataracts.
Scientists seeking to untangle the causes of Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, and other diseases of the brain and nervous system havefocused on the role that free radical damageplays in these diseases‚Äô development. But to date, there is little evidence as to whether vitamin E can help protect against these diseases or that it offers any benefit to people who already have these diseases.
Some prospective studies (Grodstein et al., 2003;Zandi et al., 2004) suggest that vitamin E supplements, particularly in combination with vitamin C, may be associated with small improvements in cognitive function or lowered risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and other forms of dementia, while other studies (Laurin et al., 2004;Gray et al., 2008;Devore et al., 2013) have failed to find any such benefit. Athree-year randomized controlled trialin people with mild cognitive impairment‚Äîoften a precursor to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease‚Äîfound that taking 2,000 IU of vitamin E daily failed to slow the progression to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Keep in mind, however, that the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease can take many years, and this study was fairly short, so it is probably not the last word on vitamin E and dementia.
Some prospective studies (Zhang et al., 2002;Etminan et al., 2005) suggest that getting higher intakes of vitamin E from diet‚Äînot from high-dose supplements‚Äîis associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Howeverother studiesdid not show this effect. In people who already have Parkinson‚Äôs, high-dose vitamin E supplementsdo not slow the disease‚Äôs progression.
Why the difference between vitamin E from foods versus that from supplements? It is possible that foods rich in vitamin E, such as nuts or legumes, contain other nutrients that protect against Parkinson‚Äôs disease. More research is needed.
One large prospective studythat followed nearly 1 million people for up to 16 years found that people who regularly took vitamin E supplements had a lower risk of dying from ALS than people who never took vitamin E supplements. More recently, acombined analysis of multiple studieswith more than 1 million participants found that the longer people used vitamin E supplements, the lower their risk of ALS.Clinical trials of vitamin E supplementsin people who already have ALS have generally failed to show any benefit, however. This may be a situation where vitamin E is beneficial for prevention, rather than treatment, but more research is needed.

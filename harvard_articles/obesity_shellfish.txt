üîó Plate and the Planet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sustainability/plate-and-planet/

Just as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment. Shifting towards a ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù can nurture both people and planet.
Human diets inextricably link health andenvironmental sustainability, and have the potential to nurture both. [1] Increased food production over the past 50 years has helped improve life expectancy and reduce hunger, infant and child mortality rates, and global poverty. However, such benefits are now being offset by shifts towards unhealthy diets.
Globally, as nations have urbanized and citizen incomes have increased, traditional diets (typically higher in quality plant-based foods), have transitioned to a ‚ÄúWestern-style dietary pattern,‚Äù characterized by high consumption of calories, highly processed foods (refined carbohydrates, added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats), and high amounts of animal products. [2,3] Along with the negative human health impacts associated with this nutrition transition, this dietary pattern is also unsustainable. Current food production is already driving climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and drastic changes in land and water use.
(Source: World Resources Institute. [4] Details about the data used to produce this figureavailable here.)
Transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems‚Äîespecially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050‚Äîposes an unprecedented challenge. However,research by an international working group of scientistsshows this ‚ÄúGreat Food Transformation‚Äù could be achievable through a combination of dramatic reductions infood losses and waste, major improvements in food production practices, and substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns. [1]
In 2019, the EAT-LancetCommission developed the world‚Äôs first scientific targets for healthy and sustainable food systems, including a ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù with defined daily consumption ranges for each food group. This dietary pattern‚Äîcharacterized by a variety of high-quality plant-based foods and low amounts of animal-based foods, refined grains, added sugars, and unhealthy fats‚Äîis designed to be flexible to accommodate local and individual situations, traditions, and dietary preferences.

Created to meet nutritional requirements and promote health, all while staying within ‚Äúplanetary boundaries,‚Äù the Commission found that global adoption of this planetary health diet would provide major health benefits. Modeling studies show that between 10.9 to 11.6 million early deaths could be averted each year‚Äîa 19% to 23.6% reduction from current adult mortality rates. [1]
Compared with current diets, this shift will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, andlegumesmust double. That said, the Commission emphasizes the importance of tailoring these targets to local situations. For example, while North American countries currently consume almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, countries in South Asia eat only half the recommended amount. [1]
Undoubtedly, making such a radical shift to the global food system is unprecedented, and will depend on widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action. Alongside dramatic reductions infood wasteand major improvements in food production practices, the Commission‚Äôs report calls for ‚Äúinternational and national commitment‚Äù through a range of policy measures and actions needed to make healthy and sustainable foods more available, accessible, and affordable. Fromgovernmentsandpolicymakersto marketers, industry, the media, educational institutions,farmers,chefs,physicians, and consumers‚Äîeveryonehas an important role to play in this Great Food Transformation.
Created throughMenus of Change(a joint initiative of The Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health‚Äôs¬† Department of Nutrition), plant-forward describes a broad set of dietary patterns and approaches to menu design that deliver both personal and planetary health but also preserve a wide range of choices.
It‚Äôs clear that what we put on our plates has a major impact on the environment. Eating more healthfully and more sustainably go hand-in-hand, meaning we can develop sustainable eating practices that improve our own health while also benefiting the health of the planet. If you‚Äôre interested in practicing a planetary health diet, but confused by the specific targets in the table above, here are some tips that may help:

üîó Diet Review: Paleo Diet for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/paleo-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The Paleolithic or ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù diet seeks to address 21stcentury ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Our predecessors used simple stone tools that were not advanced enough to grow and cultivate plants, so they hunted, fished, and gathered wild plants for food. If they lived long enough, they were believed to experience less modern-day diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease because of a consistent diet of lean meats and plant foods along with a high level of physical activity from intensive hunting. However, the life expectancy of our predecessors was only a fraction of that of people today.
The popularity of the Paleo diet, which hit a peak in 2014, appealed to consumers‚Äô increasing desire to eat more healthfully and to know where their food was coming from. [1]
The Paleo diet, also referred to as the caveman or Stone-Age diet, includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Proponents of the diet emphasize choosinglow-glycemicfruits and vegetables. There is debate about several aspects of the Paleo diet: what foods actually existed at the time, the variation in diets depending on region (e.g., tropical vs. Arctic), how modern-day fruits and vegetables bear little resemblance to prehistoric wild versions, and disagreement among Paleo diet enthusiasts on what is included/excluded from the diet. Because of these differences, there is not one ‚Äútrue‚Äù Paleo diet.
For example, although white potatoes were recorded as being available during the Paleolithic era, they are usually avoided on the Paleo diet because of their high glycemic index. Processed foods are also technically off limits due to an emphasis on fresh foods, but some Paleo diets allow frozen fruits and vegetables because the freezing process preserves most nutrients.
Overall, the diet is high inprotein, moderate infat(mainly fromunsaturated fats), low-moderate incarbohydrate(specifically restricting highglycemic indexcarbohydrates), high infiber, and low in sodium and refined sugars. [2] The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (including the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA) come from marine fish, avocado, olive oil, and nuts and seeds.
Grass-fed beef is often highlighted on the diet, which is promoted to contain moreomega-3 fatsthan conventional beef (due to being fed grass instead of grain). It does contain small amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, only a small proportion of ALA can be converted in the body to long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). The amount of omega-3 is also highly variable depending on the exact feeding regimen and differences in fat metabolism among cattle breeds. [3] In general, the amount of omega-3 in grass-fed beef is much lower than that in oily marine fish. [3] Cooked salmon contains 1000-2000 mg of EPA/DHA per 3-ounce portion, whereas 3 ounces of grass-fed beef contains about 20-200 mg of ALA.
Some randomized controlled trials have shown the Paleo diet to produce greater short-term benefits than diets based on national nutrition guidelines, including greater weight loss, reduced waist circumference, decreased blood pressure, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cholesterol. However these studies were of short duration (6 months or less) with a small number of participants (less than 40). [4-6]
One larger randomized controlled trial followed 70 post-menopausal Swedish women with obesity for two years, who were placed on either a Paleo diet or a Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) diet. [7] The Paleo diet provided 30% of total calories from protein, 40% fat (from mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and 30% carbohydrates. It included lean meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, avocado, and olive oil. The NNR diet provided less protein and fat but more carbohydrate with 15% protein, 25-30% fat, and 55-60% carbohydrates, including foods similar to the Paleo diet but also low-fat dairy products and high-fiber grains. Both groups significantly decreased fat mass and weight circumference at 6 and 24 months, with the Paleo diet producing greater fat loss at 6 months but not at 24 months. Triglyceride levels decreased more significantly with the Paleo diet at 6 and 24 months than the NNR diet.
The Paleo diet includes nutrient-dense whole fresh foods and encourages participants to steer away from highly processed foods containing added salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. However, the omission of whole grains, dairy, and legumes could lead to suboptimal intake of important nutrients. The restrictive nature of the diet may also make it difficult for people to adhere to such a diet in the long run.¬† More high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year that compare the Paleo diet with other weight-reducing diets are needed to show a direct health benefit of the Paleo diet. Strong recommendations for the Paleo diet for weight loss cannot be made at this time.

üîó Ask the Expert: Healthy Fats
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2012/06/21/ask-the-expert-healthy-fats/

We asked Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard School of Public Health and Amy Myrdal Miller, M.S., R.D. of The Culinary Institute of America to explain why it‚Äôs time to end the ‚Äúlow fat is best‚Äù myth‚Äîand to provide ideas for how to use healthy fats in the home kitchen.
1.Should I ditch a low-fat diet?
Walter Willett: If you‚Äôve been able to keep your weight, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose under good control while eating a low-fat diet, this type of diet may be working for you. But for many people, low-fat diets don‚Äôt work. In fact, dozens of studies have found that low-fat diets are no better for health than moderate-or high-fat diets‚Äîand for many people, they may be worse.
Low-fat diets are usually high in carbohydrates, often from rapidly-digested foods such as white flour, white rice, potatoes, sugary drinks, and refined snacks. Eating lots of these ‚Äúfast carbs‚Äù can cause quick, sharp spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, and over time can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. High-carbohydrate, low-fat diets also have a negative effect on the fats and cholesterol in our blood: They raise ‚Äúbad‚Äù blood fats (triglycerides) and they lower the ‚Äúgood‚Äù blood cholesterol (HDL), both of which can increase the risk of heart disease. These diets also tend to increase blood pressure.
For many people, low-fat diets are not satisfying. People finish a meal and within a few hours, they are hungry again, seeking more low-fat fixes for their hunger. This vicious cycle leads to weight gain and, in turn, to the conditions associated with excess weight (such as blood triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes).
2. Are ‚Äúfat free‚Äù foods healthy?
Amy Myrdal Miller: Some foods in their natural state contain little or no fat‚Äîfor example, most fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dried beans. And of course these are healthy choices. But processed foods billed as ‚Äúlow fat‚Äù and ‚Äúfat free‚Äù are often higher in salt, sugar, or starch than their full-fat counterparts, to make up for the flavor and texture that‚Äôs lost when food manufacturers slash fat. So they are not necessarily ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù choices. For example, low-fat and non-fat salad dressings are nearly always higher in sugar and salt.
3. Will eating fat make me get fat?
Willett: No, it‚Äôs a myth that eating specifically high-fat foods makes you fat. Eating or drinking more calories than you need from any source, whether it‚Äôs fat, carbohydrate, protein, or alcohol can lead to weight gain. Over the past 30 years in the U.S., the percentage of calories from fat has actually gone down, but obesity rates have skyrocketed. Sugary soft drinks don‚Äôt contain any fat‚Äîyet the billions of gallons of sugary beverages that Americans drink each year have been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.
4. Can I lose weight on a low-fat diet?
Willett: It‚Äôs possible to lose weight on any diet. But carefully-conducted clinical trials find that following a low-fat diet doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to lose weight or keep it off. In fact, study volunteers who follow moderate- or high-fat diets lose just as much weight, and in some studies a bit more, as those who follow low-fat diets.
Calories are what count for weight loss, so it‚Äôs important to find a lower-calorie eating plan that you can follow‚Äîand a lower-calorie plan that‚Äôs good for lifelong health. Low-fat diets raise triglycerides and lower good cholesterol, so for many folks, they‚Äôre simply not the best choice for health. For some people, high intake of carbohydrates, particularly if they come from refined rather than whole grains, can make weight control more difficult.
5. Are all kinds of fat equally healthy?
Willett: Some types of fats are healthier than others. Unsaturated fat is the healthiest type of fat. Plant oils, such as olive, canola, corn, peanut and other nut oils; nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and pistachios; avocados; and fish, especially oily fish such as salmon and canned tuna, are excellent sources of unsaturated fat. Eating unsaturated fat in place of refined grains and sugar can improve blood cholesterol profiles and lower triglycerides, and in turn, lower the risk of heart disease.
It is essential to include a special kind of unsaturated fat, called omega-3 fats, in the diet; good sources include fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and canola oil. Keep in mind that omega-3 fats from marine sources, such as fish and shellfish, have much more powerful health benefits than omega-3 fats from plant sources, like walnuts and flax seeds. But omega-3 fats from plant sources still are a good choice, especially for people who don‚Äôt eat fish.
Saturated fat is less healthy, since it raises ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol in the blood. We can‚Äôt completely eliminate saturated fat from our diets, though, because foods that are rich in healthy fats also contain a little bit of saturated fat. The best strategy is to limit foods that are very high in saturated fat, such as butter, cheese, and red meat, and replace them with foods that are high in healthy fats, such as plant oils, nuts, and fish. An alternative approach is to just use a very small amount of full-fat cheese, butter, cream, or red meat in dishes that emphasize plant foods such as vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt replace foods that are high in saturated fat¬† with ‚Äúfast carbs‚Äù‚Äîfoods like white bread, white rice, potatoes, sugary drinks, and refined snacks‚Äîsince eating too many of these fast carbs is just as bad for your heart as eating too much saturated fat.
Trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil (oil that has been chemically processed to make it more shelf-stable) is especially bad for health. Eating just a small amount of trans fat on a regular basis raises the risk of heart disease. So it‚Äôs best to avoid trans fat altogether. Most of the trans fat in people‚Äôs diets comes from commercially prepared baked goods, margarines, snack foods, and processed foods.¬† Many food makers are cutting trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthier fats. Still, you‚Äôll need to scan Nutrition Facts labels to make sure that the food you eat is free of trans fats.
Keep in mind that most foods contain a mix of fats. The key to a healthy diet is to choose foods that are higher in unsaturated fat than saturated fat‚Äîand that do not contain any trans fat. When you cut foods like red meat and butter out of your diet, replace them with healthy plant oils, nuts, fish, vegetables, or whole grains‚Äîdon‚Äôt replace them with white bread, white rice, potatoes, or other refined carbohydrates.
6. How can I cut back on trans fats?
Willett: Many food manufacturers are already removing trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthy fats. Similarly, many restaurants are removing trans fat from their menu items, so this is a big help. But you still need to pay attention to nutrition labels, to make sure that the food you buy does not contain any trans fats. Labeling laws allow food makers to say that a product has ‚Äú0 grams trans fat‚Äù even if it contains up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving from partially hydrogenated oils. This may not sound like a lot of trans fat. But if you eat several servings a day of these foods, your trans fat intake can really add up. So to make sure that a food you are buying is truly trans fat free, check the Nutrition Facts Panel to make sure it has 0 grams of trans fat‚Äîand check the ingredients list to make sure it does not contain any partially hydrogenated oil.
7. Are coconut oil and palm oil healthy?
Willett: Coconut oil and palm oil are higher in saturated fat than other plant oils. They are less harmful than partially hydrogenated oil, which is high in trans fats. But they are less beneficial for the heart than plant oils that are rich in unsaturated fats ‚Äî olive, canola, sunflower, and other oils. Coconut oil increases good cholesterol, which may make it a good choice when cooking a dish that needs a little hard fat.
Read more aboutcoconut oil and health.
8. Is it okay to eat high-fat fried foods?
Willett: It‚Äôs okay to eat fried foods, as long they are prepared with frying oil that doesn‚Äôt have any trans fats. It‚Äôs also important to look at the types of foods being fried. In America, we eat lots of fried potatoes, which contain rapidly-digested starch, and it‚Äôs good to find an alternative. Fried foods are high in calories, and it is important to think about calories, because most of us need to keep our calories in check to avoid gaining weight. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to cut out fried foods‚Äîjust choose smaller portions.
Myrdal Miller: Sweet potatoes are a great alternative for frying. Or you could just try making a smaller portion of fried potatoes, or pairing fried potatoes with other vegetables. If you‚Äôre in a restaurant and watching your calories, try sharing a fried dish with a friend. Or you could try ordering a half-sized portion of fried food along with a small salad.
9. Do I need to watch my percentage of calories from fat?
Willett: No. When you cook or read nutrition labels, don‚Äôt fixate on fat percentages. As long as you use healthy fats, and your keep your portion sizes modest, it doesn‚Äôt matter if your dish or meal has 30 percent, 40 percent, or more of its calories from fat. The same is true for your overall diet: Don‚Äôt worry about the percentage of calories from fat. Focus on choosing foods with healthy fats.
10. What‚Äôs better than a low-fat diet?
Willett: Try following a healthy fat, healthy carb diet, using two nutrition tools from Harvard School of Public Health as your guide: TheHealthy Eating Plateand theHealthy Eating Pyramid. The Healthy Eating Plate offers a simple blueprint for a healthy meal: Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits, save a quarter of the plate for whole grains, and the rest for a healthy source of protein; the glass bottle to the left of the plate is your reminder to use healthy plant oils in cooking, on salads, and at the table. Think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as your grocery shopping list: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and plant oils are in the base, and healthy proteins‚Äînuts, beans, fish, and chicken‚Äîare in the next tier, meaning that these foods should make it into your grocery cart every week. Refined carbohydrates and sugary drinks, as well as red meat and butter, are in the ‚Äúuse-sparingly‚Äù tip‚Äîso skip the soda and snack food aisle, the deli counter, and the steaks and chops at the butcher counter. You can download copies of theHealthy Eating PlateandHealthy Eating Pyramidfrom The Nutrition Source website.
11. Can you share any tips for cooking with healthy fats?
Myrdal Miller: Here‚Äôs a few ideas for how to use healthy fats in your kitchen:
12. How can I convince my family to eat healthy fats?
Recipes for Health: Nut-Based Sauces
Try these Mediterranean-inspired sauce recipes with vegetables, chicken, or fish:
Spanish Romesco Sauce(Red Pepper and Almond Sauce)Turkish Muhammara(Red Pepper and Walnut Sauce)Greek Skordalia(Almond, Bread and Garlic Sauce)Turkish Tarator(Walnut and Garlic Sauce)Italian Pesto alla Trapanese(Almond, Parsley, Basil, and Tomato Sauce)
Myrdal Miller: Introduce your family to the range of healthy foods and flavors from around the world that rely on healthy fat to deliver their great flavor. Think about the nut-based sauces of the Mediterranean that make other healthful foods, such as vegetables and fish, more appealing and flavorful. Share this article with your family members, so that they understand that the type of fat matters more than the amount of fat, and that low-fat cooking isn‚Äôt necessarily better for health. Tell them that you will cook with healthy fats, such as olive and canola oil, and you will serve foods that naturally contain healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts and fish. Promise to limit foods that are high in saturated fat‚Äîbutter, cheese, red meat. And tell them that you‚Äôll scan nutrition labels so that you can avoid foods with partially hydrogenated oil and keep your pantry and table trans-fat free.

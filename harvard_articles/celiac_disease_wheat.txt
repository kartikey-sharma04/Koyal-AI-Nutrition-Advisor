üîó Copper
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/copper/

Copper is a naturally occurring metal found in soil, water, and rocks. Nutritionally, it is an essential trace mineral found in some foods and in supplements. It works to assist various enzymes that produce energy for the body, break down and absorb iron, and build red blood cells, collagen, connective tissue, and brain neurotransmitters. Copper also supports normal brain development and immune functions, and is a component of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that dismantles harmful oxygen ‚Äúfree radicals.‚Äù Copper is absorbed in the small intestine and found mainly in bones and muscle tissue.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 900 micrograms daily for men and women. Pregnancy and lactation in adults 19+ years requires 1,300 micrograms daily, with a slightly lower amount of 1,000 micrograms daily in younger ages 14-18 years.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for copper for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 10,000 micrograms daily.
Because dozens of enzymes use copper to perform metabolic processes throughout the body, it is believed that both an excess and deficiency of copper may interrupt these normal processes and a stable level is required for optimal health. The body is typically efficient at stabilizing copper levels (absorption increases if copper intake is low, and vice versa). [1] Abnormal copper levels result from genetic mutations, aging, or environmental influences that may predispose to conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. [2]
Copper can have ‚Äúpro-oxidant‚Äù effects that potentially cause stress and damage to cells. The muscles in the heart contain high concentrations of copper, and may be negatively affected by either a deficiency or toxicity of the mineral. [3] Both conditions have been associated with atherogenesis, the early build-up of plaque in heart arteries. [3,4] Some cohort studies show an association with higher self-reported intakes of copper and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, as well as increased risk ofheart diseasewith a copper deficiency. [3,5] Other cohort studies show an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in people with higher copper blood levels compared with lower levels, although it should be noted that the higher blood levels in these studies remained within a normal range. [4,6] Due to these mixed findings, more research is needed before making conclusions on the cardiovascular effect of copper.
Some research shows that those with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), but both low and high blood levels of copper have been reported in the brains of people with AD. [1] A meta-analysis showed that people with AD had higher serum copper levels than those without AD. [7] However, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not show that copper supplements given for 12 months improved cognition in participants with mild AD. [8] Additionally, observational prospective studies have not found that self-reported dietary and total copper intakes are associated with cognitive decline. [1] More research is needed to better understand if and how high or low levels of copper are associated with AD risk.
Copper may play a role incancerfor several reasons. It supports angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor, and activates enzymes and signaling proteins used by cancer cells. [9,10] An emerging area of research has focused on the role of copper in metastatic cancer cells (these are cells that break away from a primary tumor and spread to other areas in the body). [11] Levels of copper in these aggressive cells were found to be higher than in non-metastatic cancer cells. Intentionally depleting copper levels by blocking its bioavailability may reduce the energy these cells need to travel in the body. Chelation-based treatments that bind to and inactivate copper are being researched. [10]
Copper is found in highest amounts inprotein foodslike organ meats,shellfish,fish,nuts, and seeds as well aswhole grainsandchocolate. The absorption of copper in the body will increase if the diet contains less copper, and decrease if the body has enough copper.
A copper deficiency is rare in the U.S. among healthy people and occurs primarily in people with genetic disorders or malabsorption problems such as Crohn‚Äôs and celiac disease. A genetic condition called Menkes disease interferes with copper absorption, leading to severe deficiency that could become fatal without copper injections. Also, it is possible to create a copper deficiency by taking high doses ofzincsupplements that can block the absorption of copper in the small intestine.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals as the body is efficient at excreting excess copper. It has been seen with Wilson‚Äôs disease, a rare genetic condition, that prevents copper from exiting the body and therefore leading to high blood levels. Severe liver damage and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may occur. Although very rare, it is possible to consume excess copper if continuously storing and then serving boiling liquids from corroding copper or brass vessels.
Although copper is naturally found in water, excessive levels of copper in drinking water is usually caused by leaked copper from old, corroded household pipes and faucets. There is greater risk if water is stagnant from lack of use or using hot tap water (copper more easily dissolves at higher temperatures). In these cases, exposure to excess copper can be decreased by running cold tap water for several minutes before using. It is also advised to use only cold tap water for drinking and cooking, and to avoid drinking hot tap water.

üîó Bananas
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/bananas/

There‚Äôs a bit of confusion surrounding bananas. Some people consider this iconic golden fruit a healthy choice while others avoid it, after seeing it on Internet lists of ‚Äú5 Worst Foods.‚Äù Unfavorable claims suggest that bananas cause weight gain and constipation. An article from 1917 published in theJournal of the American Medical Associationdefended the nutritional value of bananas, citing rumored beliefs during that time: ‚ÄúThe banana is a cause of indigestion and a treacherous dietary component‚Ä¶‚Äù [1]
The scientific name for banana isMusa, from the Musaceae family of flowering tropical plants, which distinctively showcases the banana fruit clustered at the top of the plant. The mild-tasting and disease-resistant Cavendish type is the main variety sold in the U.S. and Europe. Despite some negative attention, bananas are nutritious and may even carry the title of the first ‚Äúsuperfood,‚Äù endorsed by the American Medical Association in the early 20th century as a health food for children and a treatment for celiac disease.
One serving, or one medium ripe banana, provides about 110 calories, 0 gram fat, 1 gram protein, 28 grams carbohydrate, 15 grams sugar (naturally occurring), 3 grams fiber, and 450 mg potassium.
The following are other banana varieties less commonly available in the U.S.
Bananas are an excellent source ofpotassium, a vital mineral and electrolyte in the body that carries a small electrical charge. These charges cause nerve cells to send out signals for the heart to beat regularly and muscles to contract. Potassium is also needed to maintain a healthy balance of water in cells, and offsets the effects of excess dietary sodium. An imbalance in the diet of too little potassium and too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure. Excessive sodium can lead to a buildup of fluid in the blood, placing pressure on the walls of blood vessels and eventually causing damage. Potassium helps the body to flush out extra sodium in the urine, and eases tension in blood vessel walls. Bananas, rich in potassium and fiber and low in sodium, are an important component of heart-healthy diets likeDASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)that aims for about 4,700 mg dietary potassium daily.
Bananas are included in the BRAT diet (an acronym for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast), a once commonly prescribed regimen for patients with diarrhea or who required a bland, easy-to-digest diet after stomach ailments. Not just easy to eat, bananas can help replete electrolytes like potassium that are lost with diarrhea or vomiting, and contain resistant starch (especially if using cooked less-ripe green bananas) that may support gut healing.
Unripe bananas contain resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate that ‚Äúresists‚Äù digestion in the small intestine. It is absorbed slowly and does not cause sharp rises in blood sugar. The starch acts as food for the growth ofbeneficial microbesin the digestive tract. Microbes break down and ferment the starch as it passes into the large intestine, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that may play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases including digestive disorders. Clinical studies have shown the potential use of SCFA in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn‚Äôs disease, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. [2]
There is no evidence that bananas contribute to weight gain, despite popular belief. In an analysis of three large prospective cohort studies, researchers looked for associations between reported intakes of specific fruits and vegetables and weight changes in 133,468 U.S. men and women followed for up to 24 years. [3] The results were adjusted to account for other factors that can contribute to weight changes like smoking and physical activity. Though higher intakes of apples, pears, and berries tended to more strongly show a link to less weight gain over time, bananas were also associated with less weight gain.
According to the International Glycemic Index Database, ripe bananas have a low GI of 51, with slightly under-ripe bananas even lower at 42; they have a moderate GL of 13 and 11, respectively. Why is the glycemic load score higher if the glycemic index is low? It may be due to the higher carbohydrate content of bananas (there are 28 grams in one medium banana vs. about 19 grams in a medium apple); this will increase the glycemic load. However, the type of carbohydrate in bananas is classified asresistant starch, which functions similarly to dietary fiber. Resistant starch is not broken down in the small intestine so it causes less glucose to be released into the bloodstream. This produces a lower glycemic index and a greater feeling of satiety as the starch is digested slowly.

üîó Oats
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/oats/

Oats, formally namedAvena sativa, is a type of cereal grain from thePoaceaegrass family of plants. The grain refers specifically to the edible seeds of oat grass, which is what ends up in our breakfast bowls. Whether loved or hated for their mushy yet hearty texture when cooked, oats are most prized for their nutritional value and health benefits. The Food and Drug Administration allows the use of a health claim on food labels associating a reduced risk of coronary heart disease with the consumption of beta-glucan soluble fiber fromwhole grainoats. [1] Oatmeal is also a desired asset to those trying to lose weight and control hunger levels due to its high water and soluble fiber content.
Oats contain several components that have been proposed to exert health benefits. The primary type of soluble fiber in oats is beta-glucan, which has been researched to help slow digestion, increase satiety, and suppress appetite. Beta-glucan can bind with cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestine and transport them through the digestive tract and eventually out of the body. Whole oats also contain plant chemicals called phenolic compounds and phytoestrogens that act as antioxidants to reduce the damaging effects of chronic inflammation that is associated with various diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [2]
Because available research specific to oats is limited, most of the studies below assessed whole grain intake, which included several types of whole grains in addition to oats. Therefore, the findings cannot be applied to oats alone.

üîó Superfoods or Superhype?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/superfoods/

‚ÄúSuperfoods,‚Äù ‚Äúpower foods,‚Äù ‚Äútop 10 foods‚Äù‚Äîdo these titles catch your attention? For those of us seeking to improve our health, the notion of a superfood can be appealing. We may imagine a powerful food with special abilities like promoting weight loss or healing disease. There‚Äôs no scientifically based or regulated definition for superfood, but generally, a food is promoted to superfood status when it offers high levels of desirable nutrients, is linked to the prevention of a disease, or is believed to offer several simultaneous health benefits beyond its nutritional value. Its inclusion in theMerriam-WebsterDictionaryconfirms its widespread use, which defines a superfood as ‚Äúa food (such as salmon, broccoli, or blueberries) that is rich in compounds (such as antioxidants, fiber, or fatty acids) considered beneficial to a person‚Äôs health.‚Äù
Where did the term superfood originate? Interestingly, not from those who formally study food, such as nutrition scientists and dietitians. The earliest recorded example may have taken place in the early 20thcentury around World War I, used as part of a food marketing strategy. The United Fruit Company initiated an enthusiastic advertising campaign to promote its major import of bananas. It published informational pamphlets includingPoints About Bananasand theFood Value of the Banana. [1] Initially the company had advertised the practicality ofbananasin a daily diet, being cheap, nutritious, easily digested, available everywhere, good when cooked and not cooked, and sealed by nature in a germ-proof package. To get people to eat more, they suggested adding bananas in cereal for breakfast, in salads for lunch, and fried with meat for dinner.
However, the popularity of the term soared after being endorsed in medical journals, due to physicians publishing their findings of a banana diet to treat conditions like celiac disease and diabetes. [2] The American Medical Association announced that bananas in a child‚Äôs diet would provide relief for celiac disease or cure it (glutenhad not yet been discovered as the true culprit). Bananas soon bore an emblem of health, and mothers made bananas a dietary staple for their children and infants even if they did not have celiac disease. The United Fruit Company included these health benefits in its promotional material and the popular press flaunted headlines about bananas, birthing the banana diet craze.
The difference in the 21stcentury is that information now spreads at viral speed so that a new superfood seems to appear on a monthly basis. The essentials are in place: scientific research on a particular food, catchy headlines from the fast-paced popular press, as well as infomercials and marketing campaigns of involved food industries.
Superfoods often translate into super sales that have created a billion-dollar industry. According to a Nielson survey, consumers are willing to pay more for foods perceived as healthy, and health claims on labels seem to help. Interestingly, foods already perceived as healthy that also carry a health claim show the greatest sales. [3] This may be due to providing added confirmation of a consumer‚Äôs knowledge about a healthful food, increasing the likelihood they will purchase it. The survey also shows that about 80% of respondents see ‚Äúfood as medicine‚Äù and eat certain foods to prevent health problems like obesity,diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. No surprise then that plant-based foods likefruits,vegetables, andwhole grains, which are generally perceived as health-promoting, often top superfoods lists.
The food industry certainly has the incentive to market a product as a superfood, which boosts sales. According to Mintel research, in 2015 there was a 36% increase globally in the number of foods and beverages launched that were labeled as a ‚Äúsuperfood,‚Äù ‚Äúsuperfruit,‚Äù or ‚Äúsupergrain,‚Äù with the United States leading those product launches. [4]Quinoaand other ancient grains,chia seeds, andkaleenjoyed consistent sales growth in 2017. ¬†A recent list of the top 13 trending ingredients based on data from food and beverage startup companies include pea protein, seaweed, ginger, turmeric, matcha,oats, barley, andchickpeas. [5]
a√ßai,almond, avocado, broccoli,cacao,chia seeds,eggs, garlic, goji,green tea,kale,kefir, mangosteen, pomegranate, salmon, seaweed, wheatgrass
Superfoods are often nutritious but it‚Äôs clear that the term is more useful for driving sales than it is for providing optimal nutrition recommendations. A downside of superfoods is that the title alone may cause people to focus on a few specific foods, blinding them to other equally nutritious options that aren‚Äôt as hyped. Variety in our diet is important not only to gain the benefit of eating a wide array of essential vitamins and minerals, but also to prevent one from eating too much (or too little) of a particular nutrient. It also keeps our meals interesting and flavorful!
So yes,explore individual foodsand learn how to select, prepare, and enjoy them‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be distracted by the latest overhyped food or fad. Instead, focus on creating a ‚Äúsuper plate‚Äù full of different healthy and flavorful foods. Need some inspiration? Check out theHealthy Eating Plateto get started.

üîó Diet Review: Gluten-Free for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/gluten-free-diet-weight-loss/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans? In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
A gluten-free diet is not new. It is the sole treatment for 1-2% of Americans who have celiac disease, a serious condition where the body attacks a protein calledgluten, naturally found in many whole grains, causing a spectrum of symptoms that range frombloating to intestinal damage. Up to 6% of people have a related stomach-upsetting but less threatening condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity. With such a small number truly needing this diet, why have sales of gluten-free products topped $12 billion according to market research?
What is new‚Äîand driving these sales upward‚Äîis the use of a gluten-free diet for weight loss, partly fueled by celebrity endorsements and personal testimonies of not only pounds quickly shed, but increased energy, improved digestion, and even clearer skin. Consumer surveys reveal that people perceive gluten-free products to be healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts, and almost a third of Americans are now avoiding or reducing their intake of gluten. [1]
A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. Gluten is largely ubiquitous in foods, found as a main ingredient (in wheat, rye, barley, triticale, cross-contaminated oats), in sauces (soy sauce, malt vinegar, flour), and as additives or fillers (maltodextrin, wheat starch). SeeWhat Is a Gluten-Free Diet?
When first going gluten-free, perhaps the most noticeable change is having to relinquish favorite staples of bread, pasta, cereals, and processed snack foods. Because some of these products, which are typically highly processed, may be low in nutrients and high in calories, one may feel better and even lose some weight soon after removing them from the diet. Although there are now plenty of gluten-free counterparts to take their place, a gluten-free diet usually causes one to revisit naturally gluten-free whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains like brown rice, quinoa, and millet. Including these minimally processed, high-fiber foods may also help to promote weight loss and a feeling of well-being.
Though research has explored the effects of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal disorders, autism, and fibromyalgia, there is none that examines the diet‚Äôs effects on weight loss alone or for general health benefits. Because of the lack of experimental studies on weight loss, some researchers have instead examined the long-term effects of people with celiac disease on gluten-free diets, or who are generally healthy and consume a diet low in wheat and other gluten-containing grains. They have found that gluten-free diets: 1) may promote certain nutrient deficiencies, 2) may increase the risk of some chronic diseases, and 3) may actually cause weight gain.
Gluten-free foods wear a health halo, a belief that a food product is healthful even when it may not offer special health benefits for most people. Research has shown that if one aspect of a food is advertised as healthy or people believe it to be healthy (in this case, the term ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù), there is a tendency to eat more of it. [14] This may promote weight gain. Also, an overreliance on processed gluten-free products may lead to a decreased intake of certain nutrients like fiber and B vitamins that are protective against chronic diseases.
Although a gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease and may help to alleviate symptoms in various conditions related to gluten sensitivity, there is currently no evidence showing that a gluten-free diet is effective for weight loss or for general health benefits.¬† For individuals who don‚Äôt have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no need to restrict gluten consumption. A healthy dietary pattern typically includes higher amounts of whole grains and lower amounts of refined grains and added sugar.

================================================================================

üîó Gluten: A Benefit or Harm to the Body?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/gluten/

The quick answer is that it can be either, but it all depends on the individual.
Gluten is a protein naturally found in somegrainsincluding wheat, barley, and rye. It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a ‚Äústretchy‚Äù quality‚Äîthink of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough. Without gluten, the dough would rip easily.
Other grains that contain gluten are wheat berries, spelt, durum, emmer, semolina, farina, farro, graham, khorasan wheat, einkorn, and triticale (a blend of wheat and rye). Oats‚Äîthough naturally gluten free‚Äîoften contain gluten from cross-contamination when they are grown near, or ¬†processed in the same facilities as the grains listed above. Gluten is also sold as wheat gluten, or seitan, a popular vegan high-protein food. Less obvious sources of gluten include soy sauce and modified food starch, however gluten-free options of these products are available and labeled as such to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs gluten-free labeling rule.
Gluten is most often associated with wheat and wheat-containing foods that are abundant in our food supply. Negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet. There is little published research to support these claims; in fact published research suggests the opposite.
In a 2017 study of over 100,000 participants without celiac disease, researchers found no association between long-term dietary gluten consumption and heart disease risk. [1]¬†In fact, the findings also suggested that non-celiac individuals who avoid gluten may increase their risk of heart disease, due to the potential for reduced consumption of whole grains.
Gluten may also act as a prebiotic, feeding the ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria in our bodies. Arabinoxylan oligosaccharide is a prebiotic carbohydrate derived from wheat bran that has been shown to stimulate the activity of bifidobacteria in the colon. These bacteria are normally found in a healthy human gut. Changes in their amount or activity have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. [6,7]
What‚Äôs not great about gluten is that it can cause serious side effects in certain individuals. Some people react differently to gluten, where the body senses it as a toxin, causing one‚Äôs immune cells to overreact and attack it. If an unknowingly sensitive person continues to eat gluten, this creates a kind of battle ground resulting in inflammation. The side effects can range from mild (fatigue, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea) to severe (unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, intestinal damage) as seen in the autoimmune disorderceliac disease. Estimates suggest that 1 in 133 Americans has celiac disease, or about 1% of the population, but about 83% of them are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions. [8,9] Research shows that people with celiac disease also have a slightly higher risk of osteoporosis and anemia (due to malabsorption of calcium and iron, respectively); infertility; nerve disorders; and in rare cases cancer. [10] The good news is that removing gluten from the diet may¬†reverse the damage. A gluten-free diet is the primary medical treatment for celiac disease. However, understanding and following a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging, possibly requiring the guidance of a registered dietitian to learn which foods contain gluten and to ensure that adequate nutrients are obtained from gluten-free alternatives. Other conditions that may require the reduction or elimination of gluten in the diet include:
It is important to note that gluten is a problem only for those who react negatively to it, or test positive for celiac disease. Most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives, without any adverse side effects.
But does this side effect occur in people without a true gluten intolerance, and can the reverse be suggested in that the avoidance of gluten might sharpen the mind? A large cohort study disagrees. Almost 13,500 middle-aged women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study II without celiac disease were followed for 28 years to observe any potential links between gluten intake and mental ability. [15]No significant differences were found in cognitive scores (measuring reaction time, attention, memory, etc.) comparing women with the highest and lowest gluten intakes. The lack of association remained even after excluding women with a dementia or cancer diagnosis.
Unless a person has diagnosed celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a gluten sensitivity, current evidence does not support that eating gluten increases inflammation in the brain or negatively affects brain health.
This is essentially adiet that removes all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. However, since gluten-containing whole grains contain fiber and nutrients includingB vitamins,magnesium, andiron, it‚Äôs important to make up for these missing nutrients. Along with consuming naturally gluten-free foods in their whole form likefruits,vegetables, legumes,nuts, seeds, fish,eggs, and poultry, the following whole grains are also inherently¬†gluten-free:
It‚Äôs also key not to rely on processed gluten-free foods that may be high in calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium and low in nutrients, such as gluten-free cookies, chips, and other snack foods. Often, these foods are made with processed unfortified rice, tapioca, corn, or potato flours.
The gluten-free food industry has grown 136% from 2013 to 2015 with almost $12 billion in sales in 2015. Interestingly, studies show that people who do not have celiac disease are the biggest purchasers of gluten-free products. [11] Consumer surveys show that the top three reasons people select gluten-free foods are for ‚Äúno reason,‚Äù because they are a ‚Äúhealthier option,‚Äù and for ‚Äúdigestive health.‚Äù [12] For those who are not gluten-intolerant, there is no data to show a specific benefit in following a gluten-free diet, particularly if processed gluten-free products become the mainstay of the diet. In fact, research following patients with celiac disease who change to a gluten-free diet shows an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This could be partly due to improved intestinal absorption, but speculation has also focused on the low nutritional quality of processed gluten-free foods that may contain refined sugars and saturated fats and have a higher glycemic index. [13,14]

üîó Whole Grains
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/

Choose whole grains instead of refined grains.
Whole grains offer a ‚Äúcomplete package‚Äù of health benefits, unlike refined grains, which are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process.
All whole grain kernels contain three parts: the bran, germ, and endosperm. Each section houses health-promoting nutrients. The bran is thefiber-rich outer layer that suppliesB vitamins,iron, copper,zinc,magnesium,antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are natural chemical compounds in plants that have been researched for their role in disease prevention. The germ is the core of the seed where growth occurs; it is rich in healthy fats,vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. The endosperm is the interior layer that holds carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals.
These components have various effects on our bodies:
The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat‚Äôs B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.
A growing body of research shows that choosing whole grains and other less-processed, higher-quality sources of carbohydrates, and cutting back on refined grains, improves health in many ways. For a closer look at carbohydrates, check out ourCarbohydrate Guide.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1]¬†However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains:
Be careful when choosing foods labeled as whole grains: ‚ÄúWhole grain‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean healthy.
One study revealed that inconsistent food labeling means that foods identified as ‚Äúwhole grain‚Äù are not always healthy.¬†[2]
Consumers should steer towards whole grain foods that are high in fiber and that have few ingredients in addition to whole grain. Moreover, eating whole grains in their¬†whole¬†forms‚Äîsuch asbrown rice, barley,oats, corn, and rye‚Äîare healthy choices because they pack in the nutritional benefits of whole grains without any additional ingredients.
As researchers have begun to look more closely at carbohydrates and health, they are learning thatthe quality of the carbohydratesyou eat is at least as important as the quantity. Most studies, including some from several different Harvard teams, show a connection between whole grains and better health.¬†[3]
Cardiovascular disease
Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.
Type 2 diabetes
Replacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes. [8]¬†In contrast, refined grains tend to have a high glycemic index and glycemic load with less fiber and nutrients.
Cancer
The data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect of whole grains and others showing none. [12,13]
Digestive health
By keeping the stool soft and bulky, the fiber in whole grains helps prevent constipation, a common, costly, and aggravating problem. It also helps prevent diverticular disease (diverticulosis) by decreasing pressure in the intestines.¬†[17]
Some grains contain the naturally-occurring protein, gluten. While gluten can cause side effects in certain individuals, such as those with celiac disease, most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives‚Äîwithout any adverse reaction. However, negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet, though there is little published research to support such claims.

üîó Protein
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/protein/

Protein is an essential macronutrient, but not all food sources of protein are created equal, and you may not need as much as you think. Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods.
Jump to:‚ÄìWhat is protein?‚ÄìHow much protein do I need?‚ÄìIt‚Äôs all about the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù‚ÄìResearch on protein and human health‚ÄìProtein foods and the planet‚ÄìThe bottom line: choosing healthy protein foods‚Äì[Quiz] Test your protein knowledge!
Protein is found throughout the body‚Äîin muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.
Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don‚Äôt store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids‚Äîhistidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine‚Äîknown as the¬†essential¬†amino acids, must come from food.
The National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, orjust over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. [1]
The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake‚Äîanywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there‚Äôs relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. Individual needs will vary based on factors such as age, exercise level, health conditions, and overall dietary pattern. A registered dietitian can help determine one‚Äôs individual protein needs.
In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.
‚ÄúPure‚Äù protein, whether derived from plant or animal foods, probably has similar effects on health, although the mix of amino acids can have health implications. Some proteins found in food are ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù meaning they contain all twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein in the body. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more of the nine essential amino acids, which our bodies can‚Äôt make from scratch or from other amino acids. Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose¬†to incorporate complete plant proteins likequinoaandchia seeds.
It‚Äôs important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don‚Äôt get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreasedimmunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death.
However, it‚Äôs uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there‚Äôs an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3]
When we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It‚Äôs this protein¬†‚Äúpackage‚Äù¬†that‚Äôs likely to make a difference for health.
The table below shows a sample of food ‚Äúpackages‚Äù sorted by protein content, alongside a range of components that come with it.
To call out a few examples:
Available evidence indicates that it‚Äôs¬†the source of protein (or, the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù), rather than the amount of protein, that likely makes a difference for our health. You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here‚Äôs the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death.
Research conducted at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health has found that eating even small amounts of red meat‚Äîespecially processed red meat‚Äîon a regular basis is linked to an increased risk ofheart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. [4-6] Conversely, replacing red and processed red meat with healthy protein sources such as beans, soy foods, nuts, fish, or poultry seems to reduce these risks. One of the reasons why plant sources of protein are related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to protein from red meat and dairy is because of thedifferent types of fatin these protein packages. Plant-based protein sources are more unsaturated, which lowers LDL cholesterol‚Äîan established risk factor for heart disease. Also, plant sources contain nocholesterol. Other factors are likely to contribute to the lower risk, but this is a key factor.
In terms of theamount¬†of proteinconsumed, there‚Äôs evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet may be beneficial for the heart, as long as the protein comes from a healthy source.
Again, thesource of proteinmatters more than protein¬†quantity¬†when it comes to diabetes risk. Eating more red meat predicts a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while consuming nuts, legumes, and poultry is related to lower risk.
When it comes to cancer, once again, thesource of proteinseems to matter more than quantity.
The same healthy protein foods that are good choices for disease prevention may also help with weight control. Again, it‚Äôs thesource of proteinthat matters.
There‚Äôs no need to go overboard on protein. Though some studies show benefits of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets in the short term (such as thepaleo diet), avoiding fruits and whole grains means missing out on healthful fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients.
To give you an idea, this ‚Äúscorecard‚Äù from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken¬†and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it‚Äôs also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination.
Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods, many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein ‚Äúpackages‚Äù are created equal. Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it‚Äôs important to pay attention to what else is coming with it. That‚Äôs why theHealthy Eating Plateencourages choosing healthy protein foods.

üîó Vitamin E
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-e/

Vitamin E is a fat-solublevitaminwith several forms, but alpha-tocopherol is the only one used by the human body. Its main role is toact as an antioxidant, scavenging loose electrons‚Äîso-called ‚Äúfree radicals‚Äù‚Äîthat can damage cells. It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries. Antioxidant vitamins, including vitamin E, came to public attention in the 1980s when scientists began to understand that free radical damage was involved in the early stages of artery-clogging atherosclerosis, and might also contribute to cancer, vision loss, and a host of other chronic conditions. Vitamin E has the ability to protect cells from free radical damage as¬†well as reduce the production of free radicals in certain situations. However, conflicting study results have dimmed some of the promise of using high dose vitamin E to prevent chronic diseases.
TheRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin Efor males and females ages 14 years and older is 15 mg daily (or 22 international units, IU), including women who are pregnant. Lactating women need slightly more at 19 mg (28 IU) daily.
Vitamin E is found in plant-based oils,nuts, seeds,fruits, andvegetables.
Because vitamin E is found in a variety of foods and supplements, a deficiency in the U.S. is rare.
People who have digestive disorders or do not absorb fat properly (e.g., pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, celiac disease) can develop a vitamin E deficiency.
The following are common signs of a deficiency:
There is no evidence of toxic effects from vitamin E found naturally in foods. Most adults who obtain more than the RDA of 22 IU daily are using multivitamins or separate vitamin E supplements that contain anywhere from 400-1000 IU daily. There have not been reports of harmful side effects of supplement use in healthy people. However, there is a risk of excess bleeding, particularly with doses greater than 1000 mg daily or if an individual is also using a blood thinning medication such as warfarin. For this reason, anupper limit for vitamin Ehas been set for adults 19 years and older of 1000 mg daily (1465 IU) of any form of tocopherol supplement.
Due to occasional reports of negative health effects of vitamin E supplements, scientists have debated whether these supplements could be harmful and even increase the risk of death. Researchers have tried to answer this question by combining the results of multiple studies.
Inone such analysis, the authors gathered and re-analyzed data from 19 clinical trials of vitamin E; they found a higher rate of death in trials where patients took more than 400 IU of supplements a day. While this meta-analysis drew headlines when it was released, there are limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from it. Some of the findings were based on very small studies. In some of these trials, vitamin E was combined with high doses of beta-carotene, which itself has been related to excess mortality.¬† Furthermore, many of the high-dose vitamin E trials included in the analysis included people who had advanced heart disease or Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
Other meta-analyses have come to different conclusions. So it is not clear that these findings would apply to healthy people. ThePhysicians‚Äô Health Study II, for example, did not find any difference in death rates between the study participants who took vitamin E and those who took a placebo.
An in-depth look at the research on vitamin E and health.
For a time, vitamin E supplements looked like an easy way to preventcardiovascular disease. TheU.S. Preventive Services Task Force‚Äôs 2022 reviewof evidence from clinical trials found no conclusive benefit of vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and therefore recommended against their use. Although some large observational studies and clinical trials have shown a heart-protective benefit from these supplements, particularly in relatively healthy people, most randomized clinical trials have shown no benefit in either healthy people or those at risk for, or with, heart disease.
Studies showing a heart-protective benefit:
Studies showing no heart-protective benefit:
More recent evidence introduces a theory that vitamin E supplements may have potential benefits only in certain subgroups of the general population. Atrial of high-dose vitamin E in Israel, for example, showed a marked reduction in heart disease among people with type 2 diabetes who had a common genetic predisposition for greater oxidative stress.
Taken as a whole, observational studies (Willett et al.,1984;Hunter et al., 1993;Chan et al., 1999;van Dam et al., 2000;Wu et al., 2002;Fung et al., 2003;Feskanich et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2003;Cho et al., 2006;Lee et al., 2006) have not found that vitamin E in food or supplements offers much protection againstcancerin general, or against specific cancers. TheU.S. Preventive Services Task Force‚Äôs 2022 reviewof the evidence from clinical trials on the efficacy of vitamin E for cancer also showed no benefit of these supplements on a decreased incidence of or deaths from any cancer.
Observational studies and clinical trials have been inconsistent, some suggesting that vitamin E supplements might lower the risk of advanced prostate cancer in smokers and a large randomized trial suggesting that vitamin E increases the risk of prostate cancer.
Investigators had hoped that the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) would give more definitive answers on vitamin E and prostate cancer. SELECT‚Äôs 18,000 men were assigned to follow one of four pill regimens‚Äîvitamin E plus selenium, vitamin E plus a selenium placebo, selenium plus a vitamin E placebo, or a double placebo‚Äîand to be tracked for 7 to 12 years. But investigators halted the study halfway through in 2008 whenearly analyses showedthat vitamin E offered no cancer or prostate cancer prevention benefit. Though the trial ended, they continued to follow the men who had participated.In 2011, researchers reporteda 17% higher risk of prostate cancer among men assigned to take vitamin E; there was no significant increased risk of prostate cancer among men who took vitamin E and selenium.
Though these results may sound worrisome, two other major trials of vitamin E and prostate cancer had quite different results:
Why were the SELECT findings on vitamin E and prostate cancer so different from those of earlier studies? Previous studies of vitamin E supplements and prostate cancer (Heinonen et al., 1998;Chan et al., 1999;Kirsh et al., 2006;Peters et al., 2007) found the greatest benefit in men who were smokers and who had more advanced cancers. In the SELECT trial, however, fewer than 10% of the men were smokers and most had early-stage cancer detected through prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood tests. Many early-stage, low-grade prostate cancers identified by PSA test would not become advanced cancers. There is also evidence that different processes may be at work in early versus late-stage prostate cancers. Alarge trial of a drug to prevent prostate cancerfound opposite effects when used in early versus advanced prostate cancers.
Bear in mind that most prostate cancer develops slowly, and any study looking at prostate cancer prevention needs to track men for a long time. By stopping the SELECT trial early, there is no way to tell if vitamin E could have helped protect against prostate cancer in some men if they had continued the trial over a longer period of time. Very few cases in the SELECT trial were of advanced prostate cancer, further limiting the interpretation of the findings.
Asix-year trial foundthat vitamin E, in combination with vitamin C, beta carotene, and zinc, offered some protection against the development of advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but not cataracts, in people who were at high risk of the disease. On its own, however, vitamin E does not seem to offer much benefit againsteither AMDor cataracts.
Scientists seeking to untangle the causes of Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, and other diseases of the brain and nervous system havefocused on the role that free radical damageplays in these diseases‚Äô development. But to date, there is little evidence as to whether vitamin E can help protect against these diseases or that it offers any benefit to people who already have these diseases.
Some prospective studies (Grodstein et al., 2003;Zandi et al., 2004) suggest that vitamin E supplements, particularly in combination with vitamin C, may be associated with small improvements in cognitive function or lowered risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and other forms of dementia, while other studies (Laurin et al., 2004;Gray et al., 2008;Devore et al., 2013) have failed to find any such benefit. Athree-year randomized controlled trialin people with mild cognitive impairment‚Äîoften a precursor to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease‚Äîfound that taking 2,000 IU of vitamin E daily failed to slow the progression to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Keep in mind, however, that the progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease can take many years, and this study was fairly short, so it is probably not the last word on vitamin E and dementia.
Some prospective studies (Zhang et al., 2002;Etminan et al., 2005) suggest that getting higher intakes of vitamin E from diet‚Äînot from high-dose supplements‚Äîis associated with a reduced risk of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Howeverother studiesdid not show this effect. In people who already have Parkinson‚Äôs, high-dose vitamin E supplementsdo not slow the disease‚Äôs progression.
Why the difference between vitamin E from foods versus that from supplements? It is possible that foods rich in vitamin E, such as nuts or legumes, contain other nutrients that protect against Parkinson‚Äôs disease. More research is needed.
One large prospective studythat followed nearly 1 million people for up to 16 years found that people who regularly took vitamin E supplements had a lower risk of dying from ALS than people who never took vitamin E supplements. More recently, acombined analysis of multiple studieswith more than 1 million participants found that the longer people used vitamin E supplements, the lower their risk of ALS.Clinical trials of vitamin E supplementsin people who already have ALS have generally failed to show any benefit, however. This may be a situation where vitamin E is beneficial for prevention, rather than treatment, but more research is needed.

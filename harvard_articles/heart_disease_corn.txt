🔗 Healthy Heart Score uses lifestyle behaviors to estimate cardiovascular disease risk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2014/11/19/healthy-heart-score-uses-lifestyle-behaviors-to-estimate-cardiovascular-disease-risk/

An overall healthy lifestyle may prevent more than 80% of coronary artery disease (1) and 50% of ischemic strokes. (2) Yet most lifestyle behaviors aren’t included in existing prediction tools.
TheHealthy Heart Scorewas created by a team from the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health to fill this gap. It estimates cardiovascular disease risk in seemingly healthy individuals. The Healthy Heart Score is a simple tool that can be used to identify individuals at high risk forcardiovascular diseasedue to unhealthy lifestyle habits. Its use is intended to complement, not replace, existing primary prevention risk scores, sincedifferent calculatorsmay be most appropriate for different populations.
TheHealthy Heart Scoremay be especially useful for middle-aged adults who don’t have elevated clinical risk factors, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol, but who may still be at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease.
Current primary prevention models like the Framingham risk score often underestimate therisk of cardiovascular diseasein these patients. In addition, theHealthy Heart Scoredoes not depend on the results of blood tests or other clinical information, and so can also be used by individuals interested in better understanding their cardiovascular health based on information they have at hand. It may also help heighten awareness for lifestyle changes such asexercising moreor adopting a morehealthful dietthat can prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, rather than treating them once they become worrisome.

🔗 Dietary linoleic acid and risk of coronary heart disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2014/11/05/dietary-linoleic-acid-and-risk-of-coronary-heart-disease/

Swapping saturated fat and carbohydrates for linoleic acid – the mainpolyunsaturated fatfound in vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds – lowers risk of coronary heart disease, according to anew studyby Harvard School of Public Health researchers.
We talked to lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist and Takemi fellow in the Department of Nutrition, about the study to find out more.
1. Your research shows that by reducing the amount of saturated fat and carbohydrates we eat, and replacing those calories with foods rich in linoleic acid – such as vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds – we can reduce our risk of developing coronary heart disease. What’s so special about linoleic acid? And should consumers focus on reducing saturated fat and carbohydrates equally, or should we reduce one more than the other?
Replacing either saturated fat or carbohydrate with vegetable oils and seeing significant benefits indicates that reduction in saturated fat or carbohydrate is not the only reason for the beneficial effects of linoleic acid. Instead, linoleic acid itself plays a special role in support ofheart health. Randomized clinical trials have shown that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid reduces total and LDL cholesterol. There is also some evidence that linoleic acid improves insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.
2. Lately there’s been a lot of talk about healthy and unhealthy fats, with saturated fat being debated in the media. What can readers learn from your research about polyunsaturated versus saturated fats?
Our data provide strong support that substituting vegetable oils rich inpolyunsaturated fatfor saturated fat is beneficial for the prevention of coronary heart disease. The currentdebateabout the role saturated fat misses an important point: the replacement nutrient. If saturated fat is replaced bycarbohydrates(typically refined carbohydrates), there will be no benefit on heart disease. This is why many epidemiologic studies have failed to observe a significant association between saturated fat and risk of CHD as carbohydrates were typically used as a comparator. However, if saturated fat is replaced by polyunsaturated fat, then there is a clear benefit for heart disease prevention.
3. Is there a certain amount of linoleic acid consumers should aim to eat each day? What are the best sources?
Consistent with the American Heart Association guidelines, our data continue to support consumption of 5-10% energy intake from linoleic acid* to decrease CHD risk. Linoleic acid is the predominant n-6polyunsaturated fatty acid(PUFA) in the Western diet and we can obtain it from vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower, soybean, corn, and canola oils as well as nuts and seeds. A table spoon of soybean or corn oil contains about 7-8 g of linoleic acid, and 7 shelled walnuts provide about 11 g of linoleic acid. It should be noted that important sources of linoleic acid such as soybean and canola oils and walnuts also contain substantial amounts of alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid.
*For example, for a 2,000 calorie diet that would equal 100-200 calories from linoleic acid.
4. Your study also addresses claims that linoleic acid is pro-inflammatory. Can you explain what you found when you researched this?
Concerns have been raised about higher linoleic acid consumption being harmful for heart health because of potential pro-inflammatory and thrombogenicproperties. Linoleic acid can be elongated to arachidonic acid and subsequently synthesized to a variety of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which may increase CHD risk. But this speculation is not supported by randomized controlled feeding studies, in which dietary intake of linoleic acid was not found to increase plasma levels of arachidonic acid or inflammatory markers. On the contrary, some studies have found anti-inflammatory effects of diets higher in linoleic acid compared to those higher in saturated fat.
5. Based on this new study, what are some simple steps consumers can take to improve their diet?
Instead of using butter, cream, lard, and other animal fat as the primary source of culinary fat, one shoulduse liquid vegetable oilslike soybean, corn, olive, and canola oils for cooking, on salad and at the table. Although olive oil contains little linoleic acid, many studies have shown health benefits ofMediterranean dietsrich in olive oil. Nuts and seeds are also excellent sources of healthy fats.

🔗 Preventing Heart Disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/cardiovascular-disease/preventing-cvd/

When heart experts talk about prevention, they usually refer to one of three types: secondary, primary and primordial prevention. [1] All three have similar elements, but different starting times and different effects.
Five key lifestyle steps can dramatically reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular risk factors and ultimately heart disease:
1. Not smoking
One of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form. Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life. One way it does this is by contributing to heart disease.
In fact, researchers examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on mortality during a decades-long perspective study of over 100,000 women found that approximately 64% of deaths among current smokers and 28% of deaths among former smokers were attributable to cigarette smoking. [2]
The nicotine that tobacco products deliver is one of the most addictive substances around. That makes tobacco use one of the toughest unhealthy habits to break. But don’t get discouraged; many smokers do quit! In fact, in the United States today there are more ex-smokers than smokers. [3] Learn more about the hazards of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and tips for quitting from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
2. Maintaining a healthy weight
Excess weight and an extra-large waist size both contribute to heart disease, as well asa host of other health problems. [4-6]
In a study of over one million women, body-mass index (BMI) was a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease. The incidence of coronary heart disease increases progressively with BMI. [7]
In the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer.
Weight and height go hand-in-hand. The taller you are, the more you weigh. That’s why researchers have devised several measures that account for both weight and height. The one most commonly used isBMI.
3. Exercising
Exercise andphysical activityare excellent ways to prevent heart disease and many other diseases and conditions, [14-16] but many of us getlessactivity as we get older.
4. Following a healthy diet
For years, research into connections between diet and heart disease focused on individual nutrients like cholesterol (and foods high in dietary cholesterol, likeeggs), types of fats, and specific vitamins and minerals. This work has been revealing, but it has also generated some dead ends, along with myths and confusion about what constitutes a heart-healthy diet. That’s because people eatfood, not nutrients.
5. Improving sleep health
Research has shown thatsleepis an essential component of cardiovascular health.
Other factors to consider
Along with these five practices, the American Heart Association recommends controlling cholesterol, managing blood sugar, and managing blood pressure as additional factors for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health. Learn more at theAmerican Heart Association’s “Life’s Essential 8.”

You can help prevent heart disease by doing five key things and making them into habits:
Strong studies make it possible to link reductions in risk to these habits. Following a healthy lifestyle may prevent over 80% of cases of coronary artery disease, [24, 25] 50% of ischemic strokes, [26] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [27] and 72% of premature deaths related to heart disease. [28] In other words, a healthy lifestyle is a good investment in a longer, healthier life.

🔗 Oral Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/

“There is no health without oral health.” You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.
Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth—particularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body’s process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body’s immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you’re having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn’t just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

🔗 Understanding Food Labels
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-label-guide/

The information on food labels is intended to help consumers become savvy about their food choices. The front, back, and sides of a package are filled with information to inform us what the food contains and to provide guidance in making healthier selections of processed foods. However, all the numbers, percentages, and sometimes complex-sounding ingredients can lead to more confusion than clarity.
This guide will help you to navigate the terminology and nutrition information on a food package to ensure that you know what you’re buying.
The Nutrition Facts label is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was first mandated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 to help consumers make quick, informed food choices. It has undergone revisions, with thelatest update released in 2016. Changes are generally based on updated scientific information and input from the public regarding ease of use.
The percent Daily Value (%DV) shows how much of a nutrient in one serving of food contributes to one’s approximate daily requirement for the nutrient. To best use the %DV, remember these simple guidelines:
For more commentary on the updated Nutrition Facts label by Harvard nutrition experts, see the article,Updated Nutrition Facts Panel makes significant progress with “added sugars,” but there is room for improvement.
This is the section of a food label consumers see first, which within seconds can influence their purchase. This has made it a battleground between public health advocates and food manufacturers. Food manufacturers can choose to display FOP symbols or graphics that highlight nutritional aspects of the product if they are favorable to health, such as being lower in calories or added sugar, but may leave out less favorable information such as being high in sodium or saturated fat. These graphics promote a perception of healthfulness, which can be misleading if consumers rely only on these images without reading the Nutrition Facts panel for complete information. The FDA does not closely monitor these FOP graphics. Because research has shown that “positive” FOP labels like health stamps or checkmarks can overrate a food’s healthfulness, public health advocates have supported initiatives for FOP “warning” labels (e.g., traffic lights or stop signs) to highlight nutrients that are harmful to health in excess, such as sugars and fats insweetened beveragesandultra-processed snacks. All FOP labels in the U.S. are voluntary, which allows food manufacturers to highlight or hide the nutrition information they choose to help promote or preserve sales. If warning labels became mandatory, as public health advocates propose, the pressure on manufacturers would increase to change certain products to improve their nutritional quality.
These are statements reviewed by the FDA and supported by scientific evidence that suggest certain foods or diets may lower the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 regulates these health claims, which must undergo review by the FDA through a petition process. The FDA has approved12 health claimson food labels such as the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and hypertension; fiber-containing grains, fruits and vegetables and cancer; and folic acid and neural tube defects. However, just because a food contains a specific nutrient that is associated with a decreased risk of disease does not necessarily make the food healthy as a whole. An example would be a breakfast cereal high in soluble fiber for heart health but that is also high in added sugars. Research finds that consumers believe that a food carrying a health claim is healthier than a product that does not.
These statements describe the nutrients in a food beyond what is listed on the Nutrition Facts label, intended to showcase a health benefit of the food. An example is “Contains 100% Vitamin C.” Most terms like “low sodium,” “high fiber,” “reduced fat,” and “good source of” are regulated by the FDA, and the nutrient amounts must meetspecific guidelinesto make these claims. Also regulated are comparative terms like “less sugar” or “fewer calories” comparing two similar products. However, these statements can mislead consumers about their overall healthfulness. For example, a bag of potato chips may advertise that it has 40% less fat and is cholesterol-free, suggesting it is a “healthy” food, when in reality even a “healthier” potato chip is still a high-calorie ultra-processed food offering little nutrition. Some terms are not yet regulated by the FDA such as “natural” or “multigrain.” As another example, see the pros and cons of health labeling forWhole Grains.
Chile implemented the Law of Food Labeling and Advertising in 2016, comprised of mandatory front-of-package (FOP) warning labels, restrictions on child-directed marketing, and the banning of sales in schools of all foods and beverages containing added sugars, sodium, or saturated fats that exceeded set nutrient or calorie thresholds. [1] The FOP labels displayed a black stop sign that used warning words of “high in…” followed by sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories. Later analyses found that purchases of sweetened beverages significantly declined following the implementation of this multifaceted law that was more effective than prior single initiatives (i.e., sweetened beverages tax).
Opposition by food industries in other countries is strong toward warning labels such as these. [2] In the United States, in 2011 the FDA recommended a FOP graphic of stars or checkmarks that indicated a less healthful versus healthful food choice. [3] In response, the Grocery Manufacturers Association intercepted this project by introducing the FOP label “Facts Up Front,” which displays certain nutrient amounts of a processed food. There was criticism due to its voluntary nature so that manufacturers of less healthful foods could simply choose not to display it. Opposers also noted that simply listing the nutrient amounts would not necessarily help a consumer to know if it was a healthful choice if they were unsure what the amounts meant (as opposed to the FDA’s stars and checks system that provided straightforward guidance on a healthful versus less healthful choice). Regardless, soon after initiation of the Facts Up Front label, the FDA discontinued their labeling project while continuing to monitor the Facts Up Front system.
The FDA oversees the ingredients listed on food labels. A packaged food must list the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. In other words, the ingredients that weigh the most are listed first. The list may contain unfamiliar terms alongside the common ingredient names. These may be added preservatives or colors (e.g., sodium bisulfite, caramel color), thickeners or emulsifiers (e.g., guar gum, carrageenan), or the scientific names of vitamins and minerals (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol). Ingredients like added sugars may carry many alternative names but are essentially varying combinations of fructose and glucose: evaporated cane juice, high fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and turbinado sugar.
Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, eight major food allergens—milk, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, wheat, eggs, and soybeans—are required to be listed in a “contains” statement near the Ingredients list if present in a food. An example would be “contains wheat, milk, and soy.” Advisory statements addressing cross-contamination may also be listed such as “may contain wheat” or “produced in a facility that also uses peanuts.” On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act became law, declaring sesame as the 9th major food allergen recognized in the US. Sesame will be a required allergen listing as of January 1, 2023.
Other potential allergens include gluten and color additives such as FD&C Yellow No. 5. The FDA mandates that a product containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 must identify it on the food label. The term “gluten-free” can be listed on a label if it meets a specific maximum amount of gluten as defined by the FDA.
These dates found on food products inform both the seller and consumer about the shelf-life and optimal quality of the product. They are determined by the food manufacturer’s judgment for peak quality. Foods can still be eaten safely after these dates, with the exact amount of time dependent on the food product, but the flavor and texture may begin to deteriorate. These expiration dates are not required by federal law though some states may institute their own requirements.

🔗 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 released
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2021/01/12/2020-dietary-guidelines/

The 9th edition of theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025is out, with the tagline toMake Every Bite Count. Intended for policy makers, healthcare providers, nutrition educators, and Federal nutrition program operators, the new edition has expanded to almost 150 pages, providing nutrition guidelines for even more age groups throughout the life cycle. As in theprevious edition, the Dietary Guidelines emphasize dietary patterns rather than promoting specific nutrients or foods. This allows for greater flexibility in food choices, as health benefits are achieved by consuming a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods across different food categories, rather than a few “superfoods.” In addition, the Dietary Guidelines again emphasize how nutrition educators need to be aware that food choices are strongly impacted by age, race, cultural traditions, environment,food access,budget, and personal beliefs and preferences. [1]
The key players in the “Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern” remain unchanged from the previous edition of the Guidelines:
Dietary components to limit:
The guidelines carry over the same limits for saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, but this time include a specific age range:
While the Guidelines include dietary patterns that remain examples of healthy diets (“Healthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern,” and “Healthy Vegetarian Pattern”), the dietary targets for the “Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern” emphasize a diet relatively high in meat, eggs, and dairy foods. Dr.Walter Willett, Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said this about the new Guidelines:
In general, there was minimal change from the last edition of the Guidelines, which did include many positive suggestions. However, guidance that considers scientific evidence on specific protein sources and health, and also the environmental consequences of dietary patterns, is needed to provide Americans with advice and policies for healthy and sustainable diets. The current Dietary Guidelines fail to do this.
Like theprevious edition, the Guidelines are silent on the environmental impacts of their dietary targets, which other analyses show would have serious impacts on climate change and other environmental footprints because of the relatively large amounts of meat and dairy foods recommended. [2] Along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. The production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods—and red meat (especially beef) and dairy stand out for their disproportionate impact.
Willett points out that the Guidelines’ continued dairy recommendation of 3 servings per day has never been justifiedby evidence for health outcomes, and the guidance for low-fat and fat-free dairy products doesn’t detail a plan for disposal of the fat naturally present in milk:
Because the disposal of dairy fat would be hugely wasteful, it would almost certainly remain in the food supply, which makes this recommendation somewhat of a fantasy. The report does appropriately mention thatsoymilk is an alternative to cow milk, but to avoid the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy food consumption at three servings per day, the majority of milk and dairy foods would need to beplant-based.
Similarly, the Guidelines also recommend lean meats, but don’t discuss the fate of cuts of meat that are not lean. Willett says that realistically, they would almost certainly be consumed, “probably as cheap cuts and processed meats, especially by low-income groups who already experience excess rates of obesity and diabetes.”
It’s notable that the overall protein recommendation leads with “lean meats,” which could be interpreted by consumers as including “lean” or “low-fat” cuts of bacon or other processed meats. Although further guidance clarifies that “most intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey) versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham, luncheon meats),” [1] this statement is buried within the chapters of the guidelines, rather than emphasized within the summarized protein recommendation. This is a particularly important distinction, since consuming healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat canlower the risk of several diseases and premature death.

🔗 COVID-19 and Obesity
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/10/24/covid-19-and-obesity/

This page will be updated as new information becomes available. Last update: 10.24.20
The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global pandemic with its syndrome, COVID-19. The number of people affected by COVID-19 continues to increase worldwide, and information about risk factors for severe COVID-19 and mortality is emerging almost daily.
Older adults and those who are immunocompromised due to underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19 illness. For both young and old adults, emerging data suggests that obesity may be linked to risk of severe illness and hospitalization. [1,2] A recent systematic review of 75 studies found that compared to people of healthy weight, individuals with obesity were 113% more likely to be hospitalized, 74% more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and 48% more likely to die. [3] The review incorporated earlier research looking at obesity and COVID-19, including:
Its also important to note that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States; in particular, Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities. These racial/ethnic minority populations experience higher hospitalization rates, severe illness, morbidity, and mortality from COVID-19. Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have contributed to such disparities, which increase the risk of COVID-19 severity. [8,9]
The pandemic has highlighted several structural shortcomings of our healthcare system, and the need forcoordinated federal obesity prevention funding and efforts. COVID-19 has laid bare the devastating impact of the intersection between infectious and chronic disease. Focusing efforts on policies and strategies that target the root causes of obesity and metabolic health, particularly among vulnerable and racial/ethnic minority populations, continue to be as critical as ever.
Although we do not have concrete evidence regarding specific dietary factors that can reduce risk of COVID-19, we do know that eating a healthy diet, being physically active, managing stress, and getting enough sleep support our immune system. Even moderate improvements in nutrition and physical activity may improve metabolic health and reduce the severity of COVID-19 risks.

🔗 Niacin – Vitamin B3
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/niacin-vitamin-b3/

Niacin, or vitamin B3, is a water-solubleB vitaminfound naturally in some foods, added to foods, and sold as a supplement. The two most common forms of niacin in food and supplements are nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. The body can also convert tryptophan—an amino acid—to nicotinamide. Niacin is water-soluble so that excess amounts the body does not need are excreted in the urine. Niacin works in the body as a coenzyme, with more than 400 enzymes dependent on it for various reactions. Niacin helps to convert nutrients into energy, create cholesterol and fats, create and repair DNA, and exert antioxidant effects. [1,2]
RDA:Niacin is measured in milligrams (mg) of niacin equivalents (NE). One NE equals 1 milligram of niacin or 60 mg of tryptophan. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 16 mg NE for men, 14 mg NE for women, 18 mg NE for pregnant women, and 17 mg NE for lactating women.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for niacin for all adults 19+ years is 35 milligrams.
For more than 40 years, niacin in the form of nicotinic acid has been given to patients to treat a condition called dyslipidemia, a major risk factor forcardiovascular diseases (CVD)such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, and strokes. Bloodwork in someone with dyslipidemia may show high total and LDL “bad” cholesterol levels, low HDL “good” cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides.
Nicotinic acid supplements contain high amounts, up to 1,000-2,000 mg of niacin taken daily. Studies have shown that they can increase HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, negative side effects (skin flushing, stomach upset, diarrhea) usually accompany the supplements, resulting in poor compliance from patients. Clinical trials have not consistently shown that nicotinic acid leads to less cardiovascular events or deaths from CVD.
A severe niacin deficiency has been associated with cognitive decline such as memory loss and dementia. Niacin is believed to protect brain cells from stress and injury. It is not yet clear though if smaller variations in dietary niacin intake can negatively affect brain function.
Research in this area is limited but there are several clinical trials underway that may shed further light on niacin’s effects on brain health. [9]
A niacin deficiency is rare because it is found in many foods, both from animals and plants.
Niacin is available as asupplementin the form of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide. Sometimes the amounts in supplements are far beyond the RDA, causing unpleasant side effects of flushing. Niacin supplements are also available as a prescription medicine that is used to treat high cholesterol; this typically comes in an extended release form of nicotinic acid that allows slower, more gradual absorption so that it does not cause flushing. Because of the very high doses of nicotinic acid needed, up to 2,000 mg daily, this supplement should only be used when monitored by a physician.
A niacin deficiency is rare in the United States and other industrialized countries because it is well-absorbed from most foods (with the exception of some cereal grains in which niacin is bound to its fibers, decreasing the absorption) and is added to many foods and multivitamins. A severe niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, a condition that causes a dark, sometimes scaly rash to develop on skin areas exposed to sunlight; bright redness of the tongue; and constipation/diarrhea. Other signs of severe niacin deficiency include:
Groups at risk for deficiency
Toxicity when eating foods containing niacin is rare, but can occur from long-term use of high-dose supplements. A reddened skin flush with itchiness or tingling on the face, arms, and chest is a common sign. Flushing occurs mainly when taking high-dosage supplements in the form of nicotinic acid, rather than nicotinamide. Niacin taken in large doses as supplements may also increase uric acid levels, which is a risk factor for gout.

🔗 Tips for a Healthy Summer Picnic
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-summer-picnic-tips/

As summer brings warm days and later evenings, many of us head outdoors for good fun and food. Whether you’re hosting a backyard cookout, or planning a picnic on the go, be sure to fuel your family with summertime meals that are both nutritious and safe.
If you plan to bring food that will remain outdoors for several hours, choose foods that won’t wilt, melt, or spoil easily in the heat. Good choices are fresh firm vegetables (raw or cooked), chopped fruit, whole grains, pasta salad, beans, and trail mix! Here are some additional ideas to inspire your picnic basket or cookout spread:
Check out these other picnic-friendly (and portable!) ideas:
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS
WHOLE GRAINS AND BEANS
DON’T FORGET TO HYDRATE!
Hot dogs, hamburgers, and sausages are popular choices for grill food but rank low in healthfulness. They are linked with anincreased riskof colorectal and stomach cancers, diabetes, and heart disease. Along with high amounts of sodium, processed meat contains added nitrates and heme iron (a type of iron found only in animal foods) and are usually cooked with very high heat, all of which can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs). During grilling, the fat from rich cuts of meat tends to drip into the flames, producing more smoke and carcinogens called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To reduce your exposure to these elements:

Cases of foodborne illness tend to spike in the summer. There are several reasons. One is that harmful bacteria thrive in warm humid temperatures. The danger zone is between 40-140°F when bacteria can double in number in about 20 minutes, and even faster between 90-100°F. Another potential safety hazard is preparing and serving meals outdoors with unwashed hands or on contaminated surfaces. Bring sanitizer to use before and after eating, after using a restroom, after handling pets, and after changing diapers.
Although common fare at picnics, reconsider bringing the highly perishable foods listed below. If you can prevent food from spoiling in warm weather, there is less food to throw out and less waste. If you must bring perishable items, surround them with ice packs and store in a shady spot. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, discard perishable foods that have been left at room temperature for more than two hours (one hour if the temperature is higher than 90°F).
Don’t be shy in seasoning your food with herbs and spices. Not only do they infuse diverse flavors into your dish and offer beneficial plant chemicals called polyphenols (these are also abundant in some fruits, vegetables, and teas), but research has demonstrated the antimicrobial properties of certain herbs and spices. Garlic, onion, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, tarragon, rosemary, and cloves have been shown to prevent the growth of and even kill some bacteria including strains ofE. coli,salmonella, andstreptococcus. However, the exact amount of herbs and spices needed in food to produce an antibacterial effect as well as its form (as extracts, essential oils, dried vs. fresh, etc.) is conflicting, so do not rely on herbs and spices alone for food safety!
An overflowing trash bin is a common site at cookouts and picnics. Instead of bringing disposable paperware and utensils, soda cans, and single-use water bottles, use products made of glass, bamboo, cloth, wood, ceramic, or stainless steel that can be washed and reused. Consider these tips to reduce waste:

🔗 Energy Drinks
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/energy-drinks/

Plain water is the best hydrating beverage for most people, but sports and energy drinks are advertised to appeal to those who exercise or need a boost of energy to get through the day.
Though sometimes confused withsports beverages, energy drinks are a different product entirely. They are marketed to increase alertness and energy levels, containing significant amounts ofcaffeineand as much or more sugar as in soda. Many energy drinks pack about 200 mg of caffeine, the amount in two cups of brewed coffee. Other substances purported to increase energy may be added, likeB vitaminsand herbs such as ginseng and guarana. Most concerning is a lack of regulation about the safety of these drinks, as well as aggressive marketing tactics geared toward adolescents. [1] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2007, 1,145 adolescents ages 12 to 17 went to the emergency room for an energy drink-related emergency. In 2011 that number climbed to 1,499. [2]
After water, sugar is the main ingredient in energy drinks. A nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, 41 grams of sugar in an energy drink. Research has found that consuminghigh-sugar drinksof any kind can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout.
Because of the amount of sugar and stimulant ingredients, there is concern that these beverages may not be helpful, and even worse, harmful to adolescents and people with certain health conditions.
Sipping a beverage that offers quick energy may appeal to people who feel fatigued or who believe the caffeine can provide an edge when exercising or playing competitive sports. Although statements on the websites of energy drinks warn that these beverages may not be suitable for children, youth are among their largest consumers. An energy drink may be used by adolescents or college students cramming for exams through the night, or by a young athlete before an important game. While it is true that some controlled trials have shown temporary improved alertness and reversal of fatigue after taking energy drinks, as well as enhanced physical performance in young athletes, the majority of studies show an association with negative health effects. These include increased stress, aggressive behaviors like fighting, alcohol/cigarette abuse, increased blood pressure, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, poor sleep quality, and stomach irritation. [1]
A typical energy drink may contain the following: carbonated water, around 40 grams of sugar (from sucrose and/or glucose), 160 mg or more of caffeine,artificial sweetener, and herbs/substances associated with mental alertness and performance but that lack scientific evidence with controlled trials (taurine, panax ginseng root extract, L-carnitine, L-tartarate, guarana seed extract, B vitamins).
Water that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. Energy drinks are a source ofcaffeinethat people may choose as an alternative to coffee or tea. However, they also contain high amounts of sugar, vitamins, and herbs that may not be necessary for the average person. Energy drinks can pose a health risk in vulnerable groups including children, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with medical conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adults who choose to consume energy drinks should check the label for caffeine content and avoid high consumption (over 200 mg of caffeine per drink); consumption in combination with alcohol should be avoided. [9] Pediatricians should discuss the use of energy drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully. [7]

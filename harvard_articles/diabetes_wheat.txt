üîó Preventing Obesity
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/preventing-obesity/

Let‚Äôs be clear: To make strides in reversing theobesity epidemic, changes must come from all parts of society‚Äîfrom governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organizations, neighborhoods and communities. Effective policies and programs are essential in ensuring that children and adults live, work, and play inenvironments that are conducive to healthy eatingand offeropportunities for physical activity.
Personal preferences and knowledge or beliefs can influence lifestyle choices, but there are so many complex factors that strongly impact individual behaviors. This page covers individual- and family-level strategies associated with maintaining a healthy weight, with the acknowledgement that we are too often fighting against a flood of accessible unhealthy options, persuasive advertising, and policies that make it far from easy.
Preventing weight gain over the years may not be possible for everyone, but there are strategies to help reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. Most of these strategies are covered in-depth throughout the website, so keep an eye out for links to more information below.
Nutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and ahealthy eating patternis crucial to good health. Additionally,howwe eat matters too.

How we eat and how much:
Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how much food you need each day to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it‚Äôs far too easy to overeat. Try the tips below to avoid overeating.
After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness. Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1. This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss. GLP-1 RAs also lower blood sugar by triggering the release of insulin. Early research has also found these drugs to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack.
GLP-1 RAs are used to treat both diabetes and obesity, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved specific dosages and brand names for each condition. Ozempic (semaglutide), Victoza (liraglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are prescribed for diabetes, and Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide) are prescribed for obesity. Rates of weight loss have been substantial, with tirzepatide achieving up to 21% weight loss in 18 months, comparable to 25-30% weight loss achieved with gastric bypass surgery. [1] Unpleasant side effects of GLP-1 RAs are mostly gastrointestinal, with 58% of users in one study reporting stomach pain; other common complaints are constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most of reported GI side effects appear to be mild and moderate. [2] Pancreatitis and gastroparesis (severely decreased stomach emptying) are less common but appear in a small percentage of users. Clinical trials such as SURMOUNT-4 and STEP 1 have shown that discontinuation of the medications causes weight regain, although it should be noted that these trials are authored by scientists who have affiliations with pharmaceutical companies that produce these medications. [3,4]
Shortages of GLP-1 RAs have led to the creation of falsified versions that are sold through unregulated outlets. They are discouraged by the World Health Organization, as falsified medications may lack efficacy, cause toxic reactions, and may be produced in unhygienic conditions that lead to bacterial contamination. [5]
Regular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions. In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit ‚Äúsit time‚Äù or being sedentary.SeeStaying Activefor further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages.
Watching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits.
Chronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight. Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise.SeeSleepfor more guidance.
Today‚Äôs world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities.
Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies.SeeStress and Healthfor more information and tips.

üîó Phosphorus
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/phosphorus/

Phosphorus is a mineral that naturally occurs in many foods and is also available as a supplement. It plays multiple roles in the body. It is a key element of bones, teeth, and cell membranes. It helps to activate enzymes, and keeps blood pH within a normal range. Phosphorus regulates the normal function of nerves and muscles, including the heart, and is also a building block of our genes, as it makes up DNA, RNA, and ATP, the body‚Äôs major source of energy. [1]
The kidneys, bones, and intestines tightly regulate phosphorus levels in the body. If the diet lacks phosphorus or too little phosphorus is absorbed, several things happen to preserve its stores and try to maintain normal levels: the kidneys excrete less phosphorus in urine, the digestive tract becomes more efficient at absorbing phosphorus, and the bones release its stores of phosphorus into the blood. [1] The opposite actions occur in these organs if the body has adequate phosphorus stores.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years is 700 mg a day. Pregnancy and lactation require the same amount of phosphorus at 700 mg daily. [2]
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for phosphorus for adult men and women ages 19-70 years old is 4,000 mg daily, and for older adults 71+ years, 3,000 mg daily. The UL for pregnant and lactating women ages 14-50 years is 3,500 and 4,000 mg, respectively.
Kidneys help to regulate normal levels of phosphorus in the body. If the body has adequate stores of the mineral, the kidneys will push out extra phosphorus in the urine. With chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys cannot perform this action and the amount of phosphorus can rise to harmful levels in the blood. Studies show that adults with CKD have higher phosphate levels than those with normal kidney function. [3] This may quicken the progression of CKD, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, bone disorders, and death. [4,5] It appears that patients with higher phosphate levels and more advanced levels of CKD (such as those on dialysis) have a greater risk of disease progression and death than those with milder forms of CKD. [6-9]
Even so, it is unclear if lowering phosphate levels in those with CKD improves health outcomes later on. Dietary recommendations for phosphorus depend on how much the disease has progressed, and a person‚Äôs blood level of phosphorus. Some recommendations suggest limiting animal protein while increasing plant proteins, and reading food labels to limit foods with phosphate additives. [4] Plant-based proteins like legumes, nuts, and seeds containphytates, which interfere with the absorption of phosphorus in the gut. [10] Medications like phosphate binders are also sometimes prescribed to be taken with food to reduce the amount of phosphorus absorbed in the gut.
Some studies have found that excess phosphorus can promote the calcification, or hardening, of heart arteries and increase inflammation. [11] Higher phosphate levels may be associated with an increased risk ofcardiovascular disease(CVD). A meta-analysis of six cohort studies of more than 120,000 healthy adults followed for up to 29 years showed a 36% increased risk of deaths from CVD and all causes in those with the highest levels of serum phosphorus, compared with the lowest levels. [12] Deaths from all causes were seen mainly in men, not women.
The foods highest in phosphorus are animal proteins, which also tend to be high in other components related to CVD, like saturated fat. So it is not clear if phosphorus alone is associated with an increased risk of CVD, or if high levels are an indicator of another risk factor. The research is also unclear if restricting dietary phosphorus can prevent CVD in otherwise healthy adults. [2]
Elevated phosphorus levels may disrupt the normal hormonal balance of phosphorus,calcium, andvitamin Dthat regulates bone health. Animal studies have shown that high dietary phosphorus intakes are detrimental to bone health. Yet the evidence is less clear in humans, partly because it is difficult to estimate accurate phosphorus intakes. Most studies measure phosphorus in the blood, which may not reflect true dietary intakes of phosphorus, since the majority of the mineral is stored in bones and the body maintains blood levels within a specific range. However, research has shown that a higher intake of phosphate additives, from various foods like cola beverages and salad dressings that are very well-absorbed in the gut, are associated with negative effects on bone metabolism. [13] These include fractures and a lower bone mineral density. [14] More research is needed in this area.
A variety of foods naturally contain phosphorus, and the richest sources are dairy, red meat, poultry, seafood, legumes, and nuts. Phosphorus from these foods is called organic phosphorus. It is absorbed more efficiently from animal foods than plant foods. Plant foods like seeds, legumes, and whole grains contain a storage form of phosphorus calledphytates or phytic acidthat can reduce the mineral‚Äôs absorption. The body lacks an enzyme needed to break down phytic acid, so as it passes through the digestive tract it can bind not only to phosphorus but other minerals likeironandzinc. Cooking, sprouting, and soaking are some food preparation techniques that help to break down phytic acid so that phosphorus is more easily absorbed.
Inorganic phosphorus is a processed form added to foods to preserve color, moisture, and texture. It is found in fast foods, deli meats, canned and bottled beverages, and many other processed foods. Phosphate additives and preservatives are a significant contributor to phosphorus intakes, comprising up to 30% in the U.S. diet. [4] Inorganic phosphorus is very easily absorbed in the gut: about 90%, compared with 40-60% from natural animal and plant foods. [15] Phosphorus is also available in supplement form.
A phosphorus deficiency is called hypophosphatemia, defined by blood levels that fall below the normal range. However, blood levels of phosphate do not necessarily show the total amount of phosphorus in the body, as most of it is stored in bones and teeth. The most common causes of deficiency are kidney problems or a condition called hyperparathyroidism, in which too much parathyroid hormone is released that causes phosphorus to exit the body through urine. Also, the overuse of aluminum-containing antacids can bind to phosphorus and increase the risk of a deficiency.
A notable but less common occurrence of hypophosphatemia occurs with refeeding syndrome, seen in people with severe malnutrition. Patients who are malnourished from conditions like cancer, advanced liver disease, alcohol abuse, or anorexia nervosa may be started on supplemental nutrition feedings through a tube or vein. However because their starved state has reduced their ability to efficiently process food, reintroducing nutrition can cause problems. A sudden infusion of nutrients and calories causes an insulin surge, which results in rapid shifts in electrolytes and fluids in the blood. Blood levels of electrolyte nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium may quickly drop. If untreated, refeeding syndrome can lead to respiratory failure, coma, cardiac arrest, and even death. The situation can be avoided by giving these electrolytes intravenously to the patient prior to the nutritional feedings.
Symptoms appearing with a phosphorus deficiency:
A toxicity from phosphorus, called hyperphosphatemia, is rare because the body will regulate any excess levels in healthy individuals. It might occur with supplement use, but generally the use of phosphorus supplements is not common and the amount of phosphorus in them is typically not high. (2) People with hyperphosphatemia may show no symptoms; others may develop calcium deposits and hardening of soft tissues in the body, such as in the kidney, resulting from a disruption in the normal metabolism of calcium.

üîó Tips for a Healthy Summer Picnic
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-summer-picnic-tips/

As summer brings warm days and later evenings, many of us head outdoors for good fun and food. Whether you‚Äôre hosting a backyard cookout, or planning a picnic on the go, be sure to fuel your family with summertime meals that are both nutritious and safe.
If you plan to bring food that will remain outdoors for several hours, choose foods that won‚Äôt wilt, melt, or spoil easily in the heat. Good choices are fresh firm vegetables (raw or cooked), chopped fruit, whole grains, pasta salad, beans, and trail mix! Here are some additional ideas to inspire your picnic basket or cookout spread:
Check out these other picnic-friendly (and portable!) ideas:
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS
WHOLE GRAINS AND BEANS
DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO HYDRATE!
Hot dogs, hamburgers, and sausages are popular choices for grill food but rank low in healthfulness. They are linked with anincreased riskof colorectal and stomach cancers, diabetes, and heart disease. Along with high amounts of sodium, processed meat contains added nitrates and heme iron (a type of iron found only in animal foods) and are usually cooked with very high heat, all of which can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs). During grilling, the fat from rich cuts of meat tends to drip into the flames, producing more smoke and carcinogens called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To reduce your exposure to these elements:
Video:Dr. Guy Crosbygrills somemiso marinated salmon, and shares his tips for a healthy cookout.
Cases of foodborne illness tend to spike in the summer. There are several reasons. One is that harmful bacteria thrive in warm humid temperatures. The danger zone is between 40-140¬∞F when bacteria can double in number in about 20 minutes, and even faster between 90-100¬∞F. Another potential safety hazard is preparing and serving meals outdoors with unwashed hands or on contaminated surfaces. Bring sanitizer to use before and after eating, after using a restroom, after handling pets, and after changing diapers.
Although common fare at picnics, reconsider bringing the highly perishable foods listed below. If you can prevent food from spoiling in warm weather, there is less food to throw out and less waste. If you must bring perishable items, surround them with ice packs and store in a shady spot. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, discard perishable foods that have been left at room temperature for more than two hours (one hour if the temperature is higher than 90¬∞F).
Don‚Äôt be shy in seasoning your food with herbs and spices. Not only do they infuse diverse flavors into your dish and offer beneficial plant chemicals called polyphenols (these are also abundant in some fruits, vegetables, and teas), but research has demonstrated the antimicrobial properties of certain herbs and spices. Garlic, onion, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, tarragon, rosemary, and cloves have been shown to prevent the growth of and even kill some bacteria including strains ofE. coli,salmonella, andstreptococcus. However, the exact amount of herbs and spices needed in food to produce an antibacterial effect as well as its form (as extracts, essential oils, dried vs. fresh, etc.) is conflicting, so do not rely on herbs and spices alone for food safety!
An overflowing trash bin is a common site at cookouts and picnics. Instead of bringing disposable paperware and utensils, soda cans, and single-use water bottles, use products made of glass, bamboo, cloth, wood, ceramic, or stainless steel that can be washed and reused. Consider these tips to reduce waste:

üîó Selenium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/selenium/

Selenium is a trace mineral, which means that the body only needs a small amount of it. It is found naturally in foods or as a supplement. Selenium is an essential component of various enzymes and proteins, called selenoproteins, that help to make DNA and protect against cell damage and infections; these proteins are also involved in reproduction and the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Most selenium in the body is stored in muscle tissue, although the thyroid gland holds the highest concentration of selenium due to various selenoproteins that assist with thyroid function.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years of age is 55 micrograms daily. Women who are pregnant and lactating need about 60 and 70 micrograms daily, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for selenium for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 400 micrograms daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Selenium is a component of selenoproteins and enzymes. These have antioxidant properties that help to break down peroxides, which can damage tissues and DNA, leading to inflammation and other health problems.
A Cochrane review of 13 prospective observational studies showed a 31% reduced risk of cancer and 45% reduced risk of deaths from cancer in the groups with the highest selenium intakes or blood levels compared with the lowest selenium levels, particularly in men. [1] Yet, the authors cautioned about weaknesses in the meta-analysis since there were differences among the study populations and possible inaccuracy when assessing dietary selenium (regional differences in the selenium content of food was not accounted for).
Another Cochrane review of 83 randomized placebo-controlled trials did not find that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer type. In addition, some of the trials noted a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes with long-term use of selenium supplements (about 7 years) who had normal selenium blood levels at the start the of study. Further research is needed to replicate this finding. [2]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and cancer before making specific dietary recommendations.
There are high concentrations of selenium in the thyroid gland, where there are several selenium-containing enzymes regulating thyroid function. If the body does not have enough selenium, it can lead to autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto‚Äôs disease and Graves‚Äô disease. Both of these conditions cause the body to create antibodies that attack the thyroid gland, leading to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
Randomized controlled trials studying selenium supplementation show mixed results. Supplements have not been shown to significantly affect thyroid function in people with normal thyroid or mild hypothyroidism, despite causing increased blood levels of selenium. [3,4] Other studies have shown selenium to decrease the amount of these antibodies and promote the activity of selenoproteins, which work to decrease inflammation. [5]
The role of selenium supplementations for people with autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is still unclear. ¬†A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine controlled trials did not find that selenium supplements changed thyroid hormone function in people with ATD, nor did a Cochrane review. [6]
Selenoproteins help to protect cell membranes from damage by free radicals and keep blood platelets from becoming sticky, both of which can lead to heart disease. However, both cohort studies and clinical trials have shown mixed results regarding the relationship of selenium andcardiovascular disease (CVD).
Observational studies have shown that people with both low and high selenium exposure (based on dietary intake and blood levels) have an increased risk of CVD. Others have found no association at all. [7] Clinical trials have not found that selenium supplements reduce the risk of CVD or cardiac death; however these trials were small and included people who were not likely selenium deficient at the start of the study. [7]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and CVD before making specific dietary recommendations.
The amount of selenium in foods can vary widely depending on the selenium content of the soil in which it is grown. Soil content varies widely by region. Plant foods obtain selenium from soil, which will then affect the amount of selenium in animals eating those plants.Protein foodsfrom animals are generally good sources of selenium. Seafood, organ meats, and Brazil nuts are the foods highest in selenium although Americans obtain most of their selenium from everyday staples, like breads, cereals, poultry, red meat, andeggs.
A deficiency of selenium in the U.S. is rare as the soil throughout North America is generally rich in selenium. [7] Even if people live in areas with lower-selenium soil, the transport of food across the region as well as the use of fortified foods and supplements reduce the risk of deficiency.
Two conditions are associated with severe selenium deficiency: 1) Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy, or disease of heart muscle, and 2) Kashin-Beck disease, a form of osteoarthritis.
Symptoms:
Groups at risk for deficiency:
Chronically high intakes of selenium can lead to health problems, ranging from muscle tremors, hair loss, stomach upset, and lightheadedness, to more severe outcomes of heart attack, respiratory distress, or kidney failure. Brazil nuts are exceptionally high in selenium even when grown in low-selenium soil, with even one nut containing more than the RDA. Eating too many of these nuts on a daily basis can reach a toxic level, as well as using supplements that contain selenium in excess of the RDA.

üîó Mushrooms
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/mushrooms/

An often under-appreciated food, mushrooms have been eaten and used as medicine for thousands of years. Traditional and folk medicine practitioners laud the bell-shaped fungi for their healing and cleansing properties. All varieties of mushrooms are low in calories and fat, and contain modest amounts of fiber and various nutrients. Perhaps the more interesting properties of mushrooms are their non-nutritive plant substances‚Äîpolysaccharides, indoles, polyphenols, and carotenoids in which cell and animal studies have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. [1] Mushrooms are also recognized by chefs for their ability to create savory rich flavors called umami, thanks to the presence of an amino acid called glutamate, which is also found in meats, fish, cheeses, and simmering soups.
Although considered a vegetable, mushrooms are neither a plant nor animal food. They are a type of fungus that contains a substance called ergosterol, similar in structure to cholesterol in animals. Ergosterol can be transformed into vitamin D with exposure to ultraviolet light. Mushrooms vary in appearance with more than 10,000 known types, but generally they are distinguished by a stem, fleshy rounded cap, and gills underneath the cap. China and the U.S. are among the top five producers of mushrooms worldwide.
The amount of vitamin D mushrooms contain varies widely and depends on how long the mushrooms are exposed to UV light. Estimates show that fresh wild mushrooms like chanterelles and morels can contain up to 1200 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving, whereas mushrooms grown in darkened conditions like white button, shiitake, and oyster contain less than 40 IU. [3] However, button mushrooms that are exposed to sunlight can produce up to 400 IU vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving though the exact amount depends on factors related to their UV exposure such as the time of day, season, latitude, and duration. Mushrooms treated with UV lamps can produce even higher amounts of vitamin D. Even after harvesting, mushrooms can continue to produce vitamin D, whether exposed to UV light from the sun or a lamp.
Dried mushrooms also contain the vitamin. Some estimates show dried mushrooms to contain about 600 IU of vitamin D2 per 3.5 ounces if stored in dark, cool, dry conditions for up to 6 months (the vitamin may start to break down after that time). [3]
Humidity and cooking mushrooms in water do not appear to affect vitamin D content in mushrooms, but cooking them in fat (such as oils) can cause the vitamin to leach out because it is fat-soluble.
Edible mushrooms like maitake and shiitake have also been used as medicine throughout history. Other mushrooms that are too tough to eat have been used solely for medicinal purposes such as reishi. Plant chemicals and components in mushrooms may exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects, but the exact mechanism is still unclear and an area of active research. [4] Animal and cell studies show that mushrooms can stimulate the activity of immune cells, macrophages, and free radicals that can stop the growth and spread of tumor cells and cause existing tumor cells to die. [5] Various polysaccharides in mushrooms including beta-glucans are believed to exert these cancer-fighting properties. [4,6]
Two epidemiological studies found that higher mushroom intake had protective effects on the brain in older adults. [7, 8] Components in mushrooms may prevent the growth of amyloid proteins related to dementia, and act as antioxidants, specifically an amino acid called ergothioneine. A 2019 cross-sectional study of 663 Chinese men and women 60 years of age and older found that those who ate more than 2 servings of mushrooms per week (1 serving = 3/4 cup cooked) compared with those who ate less than 1 serving per week had a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). [9] After adjusting for potential confounders (factors linked with cognitive decline) such as body mass index, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and dietary intake of meat, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, the group with the higher intake of mushrooms had a 52% lower risk of developing MCI than the low intake group. This cross-sectional study only provided a snapshot of the prevalence of MCI in the participants at one point in time; the authors noted that a direct effect of mushrooms on cognition could not be made by this study. For example, it is possible that people who developed MCI had changed their diet that included less mushrooms. Epidemiological studies following people over time, measuring biomarkers for ergothioneine and other mushrooms substances, and randomized clinical trials that administer ergothioneine or other mushroom phytonutrients will help to shed light on its potential effect on cognition.
Mushrooms contain polysaccharides that act as aprebiotic, or food for beneficial gut bacteria. Studies show that these polysaccharides stimulate the growth and survival of beneficial strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. They remain undigested and therefore can reach the colon where these bacteria live. [10, 11]
In two large prospective cohort studies, mushroom consumption was not significantly associated with risk oftype 2 diabetes,cardiovascular disease, [12] or cancer. [13]¬† However, low levels of mushroom consumption in the populations may have limited the ability of these studies to detect significant associations. In addition, mushroom consumption was measured once at baseline and consumption patterns may have changed over time. Moreover, different types of mushrooms were not assessed in the Food Frequency Questionnaires.
There are thousands of varieties of mushrooms, with different colors, shapes, and sizes. Because some wild mushrooms can cause stomach upset or allergic reactions, or may even be poisonous, your safest bet is to stick to supermarket varieties and avoid picking and eating raw wild mushrooms on your own.
The common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is the most common in the U.S. It is the mildest-tasting mushroom and can be eaten raw or cooked.
Other types of mushrooms available for sale include:
Chanterelle:the cap is a wavy golden trumpet-like shapeCremini (baby bella):a young Portobello mushroom that is dark and firmEnoki:long, thin white stems with small white caps that are eaten raw or cookedMaitake:a head that resembles flowering leavesMorel:the cap is a spongy dimpled oblong shapeOyster:a fan-shaped delicate capPorcini:a reddish-brown rounded cap with a thick cylindrical stemPortobello:a large brown thick cap with rich juicy flavor that work well as a meat substituteShiitake:a dark brown umbrella cap with a thin cream-colored stem
Mushrooms that have been specially treated with UV light may carry a label on the front of the package that says ‚ÄúUV-treated‚Äù or ‚Äúrich in vitamin D,‚Äù or display the exact amount of vitamin D they contain.
Select mushrooms with firm whole caps with an even texture. They should be refrigerated until use, but ideally within one week. Do not wash or clean them until just before using. Storing in a brown paper bag with the top open will help to absorb moisture and keep them from spoiling, as opposed to tight plastic wrapping that traps moisture. Because they are about 80-90% water, mushrooms do not freeze well, becoming mushy when defrosted.
Mushrooms are delicate and should be cleaned gently. Either place them under gentle running water to release any dirt or brush dirt off with a dampened paper towel.
Cooking mushrooms in high-temperature water such as boiling and microwaving may cause its water-soluble nutrients (B vitamins, potassium) to escape in the cooking water. Saut√©ing quickly over high heat, or simmering over low heat, such as in soups, are ideal cooking methods for preserving nutrients.
More recipe ideas and serving suggestions featuring mushrooms:
Not all mushrooms are edible. Wild mushrooms with white gills or a ring around the stem are considered poisonous. Some other inedible mushrooms look like edible mushrooms, so unless one is trained in recognizing wild mushrooms, it‚Äôs best to find your mushrooms at the market!

üîó Packing a Healthy Lunchbox
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/kids-healthy-lunchbox-guide/

TheKid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Platewas created as a fun and easy guide to encourage children to eat well and keep moving. The plate‚Äôs guidelines emphasizevarietyandqualityin food choices. The formula is simple: fill half your plate (or lunch box) with colorful fruits or vegetables (aim for two to three different types), one-quarter with whole grains, and the remaining quarter with healthy proteins. Healthy fats and a small amount of dairy (if desired) round out a tasty meal that will fuel an active, healthy lifestyle.
When packing your child‚Äôs lunches, let the Kid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Plate guide and inspire you:-Remember two points‚Äîchoicesandpresentation-Save time withmeal prep-Buildsuper snacksto fill the gaps between meals-Send a refillablewaterbottle
Amidst hectic weekday schedules, meal prep is a great tool to help keep us on a healthy eating track. Although any type of meal prep requires planning, there is no one correct method. Below are just a few ideas relevant to kid‚Äôs lunches, but you canlearn more about using this helpful strategyfor other meals, too!
Snacks are meant to fill the gap between meals, not become a whole meal in itself. Keep snacks small. An easy rule of thumb for a satisfying snack is to pair a protein-rich food with a carb-rich food. Including ahealthy fatwill quiet hunger pangs even more. Depending on the child‚Äôs age and activity level, they may need one or two snacks a day.
Examples:
For more tasty snack and meal recipes, visit theFood, Fun & Family Recipe Packetcreated by theHarvard Prevention Research Center on Nutrition and Physical Activity.
Don‚Äôt forget to pack a water bottle for refilling throughout the school day.Wateris not only the best choice, but a necessary one. It restores fluids lost through everyday tasks of breathing, sweating, and even digesting meals. It keeps the body‚Äôs temperature normal on hot days and carries nutrients and oxygen to all cells. It is also free of calories, sugar, and caffeine, and other additives found insugary drinks. Beyond plain water, flavored and unsweetened seltzer or fruit-infused waters are also greathealthy beveragechoices.
Fluid needs vary based on a child‚Äôs age, size, gender, and activity level. TheNational Academy of Sciencesrecommends a range of seven to 14 cups of water per day, with the lower end for toddlers and the higher end for teenage boys. Part of this amount can come from water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables. Only when your child participates in vigorous sports lasting long periods of time (over one hour) should sports drinks be considered to supplement water. In this case you may consider making your own sports drink by mixing one quart (32 ounces) of water, 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of salt, and two ounces of 100% orange juice or plain coconut water.
Sugary drinksare a major contributor to the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes in children. In 2016 theAmerican Heart Associationrecommended that children and teens consume less than 25 grams, or six teaspoons of added sugar per day, and sugary drinks should be limited to no more than eight ounces per week.
When creating healthy and balanced meals for kids, don‚Äôt forget to do the same for the rest of the family. With a primary focus on diet quality, The Kid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Plate reflects the same important messages as theHealthy Eating Plate.

üîó Processed Foods and Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/processed-foods/

Processed foods are generally thought to be inferior to unprocessed foods. The term may suggest that a packaged food item contains many ingredients, perhaps even artificial colors, flavors, or other chemical additives. Often referred to as convenience or pre-prepared foods, processed foods are suggested to contribute to the obesity epidemic and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. However, the definition of processed food varies widely depending on the source:
According to these standards, virtually all foods sold in the supermarket would be classified as ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù to some degree. Because food begins to deteriorate and loses nutrients as soon as it is harvested, even theapplesin the produce aisle undergo four or more processing steps before being sold to the consumer. That‚Äôs why in practice, it‚Äôs helpful to differentiate between the various degrees of food processing.
A popular system to classify processed foods was introduced in 2009, called the NOVA classification. It lists four categories considering the degree to which a food is processed and the purpose of these modifications: [2-4]
The NOVA system is recognized by the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization, but not currently in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration or USDA. NOVA has been criticized for being too general in classifying certain foods, causing confusion. For example, yogurt may fall into more than one category: plain yogurt is minimally processed, but fruited yogurt with added sweeteners could be labeled either processed or ultra-processed depending on how much sweetener and other chemical additives are incorporated. NOVA also does not provide comprehensive lists of specific foods in each category, so the consumer is left to guess where each may fall.
There‚Äôs no doubt that at least some processed foods are found in most people‚Äôs kitchens. There are benefits and drawbacks.
Depending on the degree of processing, nutrients can be destroyed or removed. Peeling outer layers of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may remove plant nutrients (phytochemicals) and fiber. Heating or drying foods can destroy certain vitamins and minerals. Although food manufacturers can add back some of the nutrients lost, it is impossible to recreate the food in its original form.
Currently, bread and frozen meals are some of the most consumed ultra-processed foods in the U.S. [5] While these products can be good sources of whole grains, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, they can also be high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. Given the variety of ultra-processed foods, it may be helpful to distinguish those with lower nutritional value from the broader category. Such distinction can be determined by evaluating a food‚Äôs nutritional content and long-term health effects. A product with an unevenly high ratio of calories to fiber and healthy nutrients (e.g., unsaturated fats, B vitamins, potassium) may be considered an ‚Äúultra-processed food of low nutritional value.‚Äù For example, soda provides high calories from added sugars and no healthy nutrients; and research supports an association between a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. On the other hand, whole-grain bread and fiber-containing low-sugar breakfast cereals that may be fortified with nutrients such as folic acid have consistently been linked with lower rates of stroke. [6]
To help illustrate the spectrum of food processing, the table below includes ultra-processed foods of low nutritional value as its own category. We also we separate the NOVA categories of ‚Äúunprocessed‚Äù and ‚Äúminimally processed‚Äù foods, and omit NOVA‚Äôs ‚Äúprocessed culinary ingredients‚Äù category, which mainly includes supplementary food components to assist in cooking and food preparation.

Ingredients used widely in the production of ultra-processed foods such assaturated fats,added sugar, andsodiumhave become markers of poor diet quality due to their effect on heart disease, obesity, and high blood pressure. [8,9] It is estimated that ultra-processed foods contribute about 90% of the total calories obtained from added sugars. [5]
Food processing is a very broad spectrum that ranges from basic technologies like freezing or milling, to the incorporation of additives that promote shelf stability or increase palatability. As a general rule, emphasizing unprocessed or minimally processed foods in the daily diet is optimal. That said, the use of processed and even ultra-processed foods is the choice of the consumer, and there are pros and cons that come with each type. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a more processed food in one‚Äôs diet. There is evidence showing an association with certain types of food processing and poor health outcomes, especially low-nutrient ultra-processed foods that containadded sugars,excess sodium, andunhealthful fats. But there also exist ultra-processed foods that have low amounts of these ingredients while being fortified in beneficial nutrients such as calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins B and D.
Research is still clarifying if any harmful health effects from ultra-processed foods arise from the higher degree of processing or simply from the poorer nutritional quality often accompanying these types of foods. There is a growing range of processed and ultra-processed foods available, and some products may be a useful addition to a healthful diet.
You don‚Äôt have to avoid all processed foods but begin by adding more fresh or minimally processed ingredients to your shopping cart. More time may be needed to prepare these foods than just opening a can or popping a frozen container in a microwave, but the rewards may be fresher flavors, increased nutrients, and eating less additives that have no nutritional benefit.

üîó Lectins
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/anti-nutrients/lectins/

Lectins, or hemagglutinins, are an ‚Äúanti-nutrient‚Äù that have received much attention due to popular media and fad diet books citing lectins as a major cause for obesity, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. They are found in all plants, but rawlegumes(beans,lentils, peas, soybeans, peanuts) and whole grains like wheat contain the highest amounts of lectins. Is there truth behind these claims?
Lectins are defined as proteins that bind to carbohydrates. The same features that lectins use to defend plants in nature may cause problems during human digestion. They resist being broken down in the gut and are stable in acidic environments, features that protect lectin-containing plants in nature. [1]
When consumed, lectins in their active state can cause negative side effects. The most publicized accounts report severe reactions in people eating even small amounts of raw or undercooked kidney beans. They contain phytohaemagglutinin, a type of lectin that can cause red blood cells to clump together. It can also produce nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, and diarrhea. [2] Milder side effects include bloating and gas.
Animal and cell studies have found that active lectins can interfere with the absorption of minerals, especiallycalcium,iron,phosphorus, andzinc. Legumes and cereals often contain these minerals, so the concurrent presence of lectins may prevent the absorption and use of these minerals in the body. Lectins can also bind to cells lining the digestive tract. This may disrupt the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, and affect the growth and action of intestinal flora. Because lectin proteins bind to cells for long periods of time, they can potentially cause an autoimmune response and are theorized to play a role in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. [2,3]
These theories have fueled the profitable anti-lectin movement, spawning bestselling books and enzyme supplements to prevent lectin activity in the body. However, there is very limited research in humans on the amount of active lectins consumed in the diet and their long-term health effects. Anti-nutrients including lectins are most often studied in the diets of developing countries where malnutrition is prevalent, or where food variety is very limited and whole grains and legumes are important daily staples. [4,5]
It is important to remember that eating foods with a high amount of active lectins is rare. One reason is that lectins are most potent in their raw state, and foods containing them are not typically eaten raw. Cooking, especially with wet high-heat methods like boiling or stewing, or soaking in water for several hours, can inactivate most lectins. [6] Lectins are water-soluble and typically found on the outer surface of a food, so exposure to water removes them.
An example is dried beans. To prepare them for eating, they are soaked for several hours and then boiled for several more hours to soften the bean, which disables the action of lectins. Canned beans are cooked and packaged in liquid, so they are also low in lectins. However, raw beans simmered at low heat such as in a slow-cooker or undercooking the beans will not remove all the lectins.
The body can produce enzymes during digestion that degrades some lectins. Other processes that deactivate the compounds are sprouting grains and beans, and mechanically removing the outer hull of beans and wheat grains that contain the most lectins.
There are different types of lectins in different foods, and the reactions people have to them vary widely. It is possible that one who has an underlying digestive sensitivity, such as irritable bowel syndrome, may be more likely to experience negative symptoms from eating lectins and otheranti-nutrients. Because the reported symptoms of lectin sensitivity are recognizable with physical discomfort, a reasonable solution may be to eat less of or less often the foods that cause digestive problems.
Lectins can act as anantioxidant, which protects cells from damage caused by free radicals. They also slow down digestion and the absorption ofcarbohydrates, which may prevent sharp rises in blood sugar and high insulin levels. Early research is also looking at the use of non-toxic low amounts of certain lectins to help stimulate gut cell growth in patients who are unable to eat for long periods, and in anticancer treatments due to the ability of lectins to cause cancer cell death. [2,6-7]
In many large population studies, lectin-containing foods likelegumes,whole grains, andnutsare associated with intentional weight loss and lower rates of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. [8-11] These foods are rich sources ofB vitamins,protein,fiber, and minerals, andhealthy fats. Thus, the health benefits of consuming these foods far outweigh the potential harm of lectins in these foods.
Are Anti-Nutrients Harmful?

üîó Are Anti-Nutrients Harmful?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/anti-nutrients/

The takeaway:The pros and cons of anti-nutrients on long-term human health is an area of active research. Though certain foods may contain residual amounts of anti-nutrients after processing and cooking, the health benefits of eating these foods outweigh any potential negative nutritional effects. Eatinga variety of nutritious foodsdaily and avoiding eating large amounts of a single food at one meal can help to offset minor losses in nutrient absorption caused by anti-nutrients.
The term ‚Äúanti-nutrients‚Äù suggests what they are. Whereas nutrients are substances that nourish plants and animals to grow and live, anti-nutrients earn their title because they can block the absorption of nutrients. Anti-nutrients are naturally found in animals and many plant-based foods. In plants, they are compounds designed to protect from bacterial infections and being eaten by insects. [1]
There are several compounds in the foods we eat classified as anti-nutrients. Examples include:
It is not known how much nutrient loss occurs in our diets because of anti-nutrients, and the effects vary among individuals based on their metabolism and how the food is cooked and prepared. Many anti-nutrients like phytates, lectins, and glucosinolates can be removed or deactivated by soaking, sprouting, or boiling the food before eating.
Another consideration is that these anti-nutrients affect the absorption of nutrients eaten at the same meal. Therefore to lower this risk, it is recommended to avoid eating large quantities of foods containing anti-nutrients at one meal, and to eat a balanced diet throughout the day with a variety of foods. [3] For example, instead of eating two cups of bran cereal with milk for breakfast, choose one cup of cereal with milk and one cup of fresh berries.
People who are at high risk for diseases related to mineral deficiencies, such as osteoporosis with calcium deficiency oranemia with iron deficiency, may wish to monitor their food choices for anti-nutrient content. Another strategy could be altering the timing of eating foods with anti-nutrients. Examples are to drink tea between meals instead of with a meal to reduce the chances of iron being poorly absorbed, or taking acalciumsupplement a few hours after eating a high-fiber wheat bran cereal that contains phytates.
Some studies on vegetarians who eat diets high in plant foods containing anti-nutrients do not generally show deficiencies in iron and zinc, so the body may be adapting to the presence of anti-nutrients by increasing the absorption of these minerals in the gut. [3] Still, other studies have shown that iron stores and blood zinc levels in vegetarians are typically below those of non-vegetarians. [4] How well non-heme iron (the form found in plant foods) and zinc are absorbed in the body is impacted by the amount of inhibitors such as phytates. A review found that these inhibitors negatively affected the absorption of non-heme iron, varying from 1% to 23%. [4]
Keep in mind that anti-nutrients may also exert health benefits. Phytates, for example, have been found to lower cholesterol, slow digestion, and prevent sharp rises in blood sugar. [2] Many anti-nutrients haveantioxidantand anticancer actions, so avoiding them entirely is not recommended. [3,5,8]
A few studies have found a small but significant increased risk of disease with higher intakes of glucosinolates, which are obtained mainly through cruciferous vegetables. In two studies following three large prospective cohorts of 42,170 male and 168,404 female health professionals for several years, a higher intake of glucosinolates was associated with a slightly higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes in men and women. Individuals with the highest intakes of glucosinolates had a 19% increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those with the lowest intakes, even after adjusting for other factors that can affect diabetes, such as BMI, physical activity, and smoking. [6] The strongest associations were observed for Brussels sprouts when comparing the highest (1 or more servings/week) and lowest intakes (never or almost never). In a separate analysis of these same three cohorts looking at intakes of glucosinolates and heart disease, participants who consumed one or more servings a week of Brussels sprouts and cabbage had a higher heart disease risk than those who consumed these vegetables less than once per month. [7] The authors did not recommend avoiding these foods but rather emphasized a need for more studies to replicate and confirm these findings to better understand this possible relation, as several other studies have shown a protective effect on diabetes and heart disease with higher intakes of cruciferous vegetables.
Phytic acid, or phytates, is the stored form of phosphorus found in seeds,nuts,legumes, and unprocessedwhole grains(concentrated in the outer bran layers). The amount of phytic acid in these foods varies widely even within the same food, based on the seed type, environmental conditions, climate, and soil quality. Phytic acid can have health benefits due to its antioxidant properties. Laboratory and animal studies show that it can protect against DNA damage and cancer cell growth. The chemical name for phytic acid, inositol hexakisphosphate or IP6, is very actively studied in cancer research and, though research is still early, IP6 has become a popular over-the-counter supplement. Phytic acid can also prevent kidney stones from forming by inhibiting the buildup of calcium crystals, a component of kidney stones.
However, phytic acid is also labeled an antinutrient because humans lack the phytase enzyme needed to break it down. As it passes through the gut, phytic acid binds to minerals likeiron,zinc, andcalciumso they are not well-absorbed in the intestine. This will occur only when phytic acid is eaten with foods containing these minerals at the same meal. The average Western diet usually has enough nutrients and variety to protect from a true deficiency, especially with the inclusion of some animal proteins (e.g., lean pork, poultry, shellfish) that are rich in zinc and heme-iron, a well-absorbed form of iron. A nutrient deficiency more likely occurs in developing countries where a variety of food choices is limited, the risk of malnutrition is higher, and legumes or whole grains are staples that are eaten with every meal. Also at risk are those who eat a vegan diet (which not only consists of plenty of seeds/nuts, legumes, and grains but these foods contain poorly absorbed non-heme iron), or those who already have an iron or zinc deficiency due to medical reasons.
How you prepare foods high in phytic acid can reduce the overall amount. Cooking, soaking overnight in water,sprouting(germination), fermentation, and pickling can all break down phytic acid so that the phosphorus can be released and absorbed by the body. Some natural bacteria in the colon contain the enzyme phytase and can also help to break it down.
Because of the potential health benefits of phytic acid, if your diet contains a variety of plant-based and lean animal foods, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how much you are eating. Only those already at risk for nutrient deficiencies of the minerals mentioned or those who eat only plant foods such as vegans may need to consider reducing phytic acid in the diet.
If you‚Äôve been told by your doctor that you have calcium oxalate stones, the most common type of kidney stones, then you may have been advised to avoid foods high in oxalates. The tricky part is that many healthful plant foods are rich in oxalates including certain green leafy vegetables (spinach, Swiss chard), beets, beans, certain nuts (almonds), rice bran, and potatoes.
After we eat food, the body uses what it needs for energy. Some of the remaining food components not needed are shuttled to the kidneys to be excreted in urine. If there is too much waste and not enough liquid, tiny crystals can form. If there is not enough liquid or urine to flush them out, a high amount of oxalates in the urine can form crystals by attaching to calcium. Sometimes the crystals clump together to form a stone that is painful when it moves to pass.
However, avoiding dietary oxalate is not the only or best way to avoid kidney stones. It is important to drink enough fluids, especially water, to dilute the urine so that substances like oxalates do not collect and stick together. Eating calcium-rich foods at the same time as oxalate-rich foods can also help, as the oxalates will bind to calcium in the stomach, preventing the oxalate from being absorbed into the body. An example is to drink calcium-fortified milk or plant milk with a meal or snack that contains beans, spinach, or nuts.
Some people at risk for kidney stones may ‚Äúhyper-absorb‚Äù oxalates, so in these cases moderating intake of oxalate-rich foods may be particularly helpful. [8] Cooking foods may also lower oxalate content. Oxalates dissolve in water, and some research indicates that boiling vegetables for 12 minutes can lower their oxalate content by 30-87%, with leafy greens like spinach and Swiss chard showing the greatest losses at about 85%. Steaming had less of an effect, showing about 45% loss of oxalates. [8]
Three large cohorts from the Health Professionals Follow-up study and Nurses‚Äô Health Study (NHS) I and II found an average 20% increased risk of forming kidney stones with high oxalate intakes in men and women. [9] Men who had the lowest calcium intakes of less than 755 mg daily and the highest oxalate intakes had a 46% increased risk of developing stones. But higher calcium intakes in men were also found to be significantly protective from developing stones. A follow-up review of the NHS confirmed that higher calcium intakes were protective from kidney stones in women. [10] Other studies have found the DASH diet had a 40-50% lower risk of kidney stones, which may be due to the diet being rich in potassium and magnesium, minerals protective from kidney stones. [11]
Therefore, a dietary strategy to prevent kidney stones is more complex than just avoiding oxalates. For those at risk, drink plenty of water every day, eat enough calcium from foods, and eat low amounts of oxalate-rich foods taken with calcium-rich foods. Always inform your doctor about any dietary changes that are made for health reasons.

üîó Rice
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/rice/

Rice is a main staple in more than 100 countries worldwide. [1] In some households, rice is included with more than one meal a day. This starchy high-calorie grain is generally low cost, making it accessible to all and a vital base of many diets. Each country showcases a rice specialty to reflect local spices and taste preferences: risotto in Italy, paella in Spain, jambalaya in the southern U.S., coconut rice in Colombia, steamed rice in China, rice and beans in Mexico, and sweet rice in Portugal, to name a few.
The scientific name for rice isOryza. Oryza sativais the most common species and is subdivided into the long-grainindica, and short-grainjaponica. Tools for farming rice have been found in China dating back 8000 years. Merchant traders helped the gradual spread of rice across the continents.
(*primarilywhole grainvarieties)
There are thousands of types ofOryza sativa, which can differ in size, thickness, stickiness, color, aroma, and flavor. Rice is often broadly categorized based on its shape or method of processing:
This refers to the length and width of the rice grain after cooking:
Is the rice in its whole, intact form (like ‚Äúbrown‚Äù rice), or has it been milled and polished (like ‚Äúwhite‚Äù rice)?
Of course, when it comes to cooking, specific varieties of rice are often chosen for their unique characteristics. Here are a few popular types:
Because large amounts of rice are eaten in some countries, along with an increasing worldwide prevalence oftype 2 diabetesand insulin resistance, rice intake‚Äôs effect on health has been studied.
The glycemic index(GI) is a measure of how quickly and how much a food raises one‚Äôs blood sugar levels after eating. Rice is considered a high GI food but it varies depending on the type and amount of processing (processing increases the GI). Reports show the GI of rice ranging from 48-93. [2] Low GI foods have a rating of 55 or less, medium GI foods are 56-69, and high GI foods are 70-100. The average GI for brown rice is low at 55, whereas the GI for white rice is higher at 64. [3] Observational studies have found an association between a high GI diet and greater risk for type 2 diabetes.
The message of these studies was consistent with public health recommendations to replace refined grains with whole grains, and to choose at least two servings of whole grains a day to reduce type 2 diabetes risk.
In a large cohort study of 71,750 women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and 42,823 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, intakes of brown rice did not lower the risk of ischemic stroke. [6] However, intakes of brown rice in this group were generally lower than intakes of other grain foods that did decrease stroke risk like whole grain cereals and bran. A systematic review of 45 studies on whole grains did not find a reduced risk of stroke, heart disease, or cancer from intakes of either white or brown rice. [7]
Arsenic is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in soil, rock, and water. The term ‚Äútotal arsenic‚Äù includes organic and inorganic arsenic compounds. Organic arsenic is found mostly in seafood and is considered less toxic. Inorganic arsenic is toxic and found in soil, groundwater, and industrial chemicals. Though a high amount of inorganic arsenic is deadly, long-term exposure to lower levels is also concerning as it may increase the risk of various diseases.
In 2012, reports surfaced about the potentially high levels of inorganic arsenic in rice. [8] The amount in our food supply results largely from contaminated groundwater and soil from livestock manure, fertilizer, pesticides, and industrial waste. [9] This is concerning to individuals who eat rice daily. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term exposure to arsenic can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Exposure to arsenic at young ages has been linked to certain cancers and neurological defects. [1]
Arsenic accumulates in rice 10 times more than in other grains due to being cultivated in water-flooded fields, where irrigation water as well as the soil may be contaminated with arsenic. [10] The rice grain easily absorbs arsenic into its roots through water. In the U.S., rice grown in southern states contains high amounts of arsenic because of residual metals in the soil from the historical use of arsenic-laced pesticides to treat cotton crops. Rice products such as rice cereal and rice crackers may also contain high levels of arsenic. The amount of arsenic in other types of rice such as black or red depends on the exact species and the amount of inorganic arsenic in the soil and water supply, which can vary greatly by region.
There is no federal limit for arsenic in food and beverages other than water. The standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). One report found as much as 193 ppm in brown rice grown in the southern U.S. [2] A later report by the FDA also found high levels with an average concentration of 154 ppb in brown rice. [11]
Early life exposure to arsenic increases the risk of negative health effects later in life. Non-profit organizations have pushed for federal standards limiting the amount of arsenic in the food supply. Congress introduced a bill in 2012 called the RICE Act (Reducing food-based Inorganic and Organic Compounds Exposure Act) to establish limits on the amount of total arsenic allowed in rice and rice products. [12] In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drafted a proposed limit of 100 ppb in infant rice cereal and juice, but further action by the FDA or voluntary standards by manufacturers have not been established. [13] The FDA advised that parents give infants a variety of fortified cereals other than rice such as oat, barley, and multigrain. Pregnant women and toddlers should also eat a variety of whole grains other than rice. [14]
Additional ways to reduce arsenic exposure from rice:
If you eat brown rice or brown rice products frequently or more than four times a week, consider purchasing brands grown in non-polluted regions (such as California as opposed to Arkansas or Texas).

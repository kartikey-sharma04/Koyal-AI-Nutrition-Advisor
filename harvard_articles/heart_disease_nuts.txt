üîó Study sheds light on dairy fat and cardiovascular disease risk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2016/10/25/dairy-fat-cardiovascular-disease-risk/

Until recently, when you visited the dairy aisle, chances are you headed straight for the blue carton of milk‚Äîthe skim milk that is. But recent buzz about dairy fat may cause shoppers to pause in front of the oft-shunned red carton of whole milk or other full-fat dairy products, as research suggests that their relationship toheart healthis more complex than was once believed. While most studies to date have focused on the association between dairyfatand cardiovascular riskfactors,few have examined the relationship to actualonsetof cardiovascular disease.
To address this gap in the literature, a new study by Harvard Chan School researchers published inThe American Journal of Clinical Nutritioninvestigated the relationship between dairy fat intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke. (1) Researchers followed more than 43,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, 87,000 women in theNurses‚Äô Health Study, and 90,000 women in the Nurses‚Äô Healthy Study II to study the relationship between dairy fat and heart disease risk. The detailed information collected over several decades allowed the investigators to adjust for smoking, physical activity, and other factors known to influence the development of heart disease. For dairy lovers, the good news is that various foods including full-fat dairy milk, yogurt, butter, cheeses, and cream were not found to increase heart disease risk (compared to a background diet that typically contains high amounts of refined carbohydrates and sugars). However, it is important to note that these foods were not found to decrease risk either.
What did predict risk of cardiovascular disease was ‚Äúfat swapping.‚Äù When dairy fat was replaced with the same number¬†of calories from vegetable fat or¬†polyunsaturated fat, the risk of cardiovascular disease dropped by 10% and 24%, respectively. Furthermore, replacing the same number¬†of calories from dairy fat with healthful carbohydrates from whole grains was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.
Replacing dairy fat with other types of animal fat, such as from red meat, predicted a modest 6% higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
‚ÄúThese results suggest that dairy fat is not an optimal type of fat in our diets. Although one can enjoy moderate amounts of full-fat dairy such as cheese, a healthy diet pattern tends to be plant-based and low in saturated fat,‚Äù said Frank Hu, senior author of the study. ‚ÄúThese results strongly support existing recommendations to choose mainly unsaturated fats from vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and some oily fish for a heart-healthy diet.‚Äù
In terms of specific dairy products, Hu does not recommend regular consumption of full-fat milk or eating a lot of cheese, which is often paired with processed meats and refined flour in the form of hamburgers and pizza. Instead, small amounts of cheese can be consumed as a snack with fruits or whole-grain crackers. Among the range of dairy products, yogurt appears to have more health benefits. A cup of plain yogurt with nuts or fresh fruit for flavor and texture makes for asatisfying breakfastor healthy snack.

üîó Healthy Heart Score uses lifestyle behaviors to estimate cardiovascular disease risk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2014/11/19/healthy-heart-score-uses-lifestyle-behaviors-to-estimate-cardiovascular-disease-risk/

An overall healthy lifestyle may prevent more than 80% of coronary artery disease (1) and 50% of ischemic strokes. (2) Yet most lifestyle behaviors aren‚Äôt included in existing prediction tools.
TheHealthy Heart Scorewas created by a team from the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health to fill this gap. It estimates cardiovascular disease risk in seemingly healthy individuals. The Healthy Heart Score is a simple tool that can be used to identify individuals at high risk forcardiovascular diseasedue to unhealthy lifestyle habits. Its use is intended to complement, not replace, existing primary prevention risk scores, sincedifferent calculatorsmay be most appropriate for different populations.
TheHealthy Heart Scoremay be especially useful for middle-aged adults who don‚Äôt have elevated clinical risk factors, like high blood pressure or high cholesterol, but who may still be at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease.
Current primary prevention models like the Framingham risk score often underestimate therisk of cardiovascular diseasein these patients. In addition, theHealthy Heart Scoredoes not depend on the results of blood tests or other clinical information, and so can also be used by individuals interested in better understanding their cardiovascular health based on information they have at hand. It may also help heighten awareness for lifestyle changes such asexercising moreor adopting a morehealthful dietthat can prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, rather than treating them once they become worrisome.

üîó Dietary linoleic acid and risk of coronary heart disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2014/11/05/dietary-linoleic-acid-and-risk-of-coronary-heart-disease/

Swapping saturated fat and carbohydrates for linoleic acid ‚Äì the mainpolyunsaturated fatfound in vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds ‚Äì lowers risk of coronary heart disease, according to anew studyby Harvard School of Public Health researchers.
We talked to lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist and Takemi fellow in the Department of Nutrition, about the study to find out more.
1. Your research shows that by reducing the amount of saturated fat and carbohydrates we eat, and replacing those calories with foods rich in linoleic acid ‚Äì such as vegetable oil, nuts, and seeds ‚Äì we can reduce our risk of developing coronary heart disease. What‚Äôs so special about linoleic acid? And should consumers focus on reducing saturated fat and carbohydrates equally, or should we reduce one more than the other?
Replacing either saturated fat or carbohydrate with vegetable oils and seeing significant benefits indicates that reduction in saturated fat or carbohydrate is not the only reason for the beneficial effects of linoleic acid. Instead, linoleic acid itself plays a special role in support ofheart health. Randomized clinical trials have shown that replacing saturated fat with linoleic acid reduces total and LDL cholesterol. There is also some evidence that linoleic acid improves insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.
2. Lately there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about healthy and unhealthy fats, with saturated fat being debated in the media. What can readers learn from your research about polyunsaturated versus saturated fats?
Our¬†data provide strong support that substituting vegetable oils rich inpolyunsaturated fatfor saturated fat is beneficial for the prevention of coronary heart disease. The currentdebateabout the role saturated fat misses an important point: the replacement nutrient. If saturated fat is replaced bycarbohydrates(typically refined carbohydrates), there will be no benefit on heart disease. This is why many epidemiologic studies have failed to observe a significant association between saturated fat and risk of CHD as carbohydrates were typically used as a comparator. However, if saturated fat is replaced by polyunsaturated fat, then there is a clear benefit for heart disease prevention.
3. Is there a certain amount of linoleic acid consumers should aim to eat each day? What are the best sources?
Consistent with the American Heart Association guidelines, our data continue to support consumption of 5-10% energy intake from linoleic acid* to decrease CHD risk. Linoleic acid is the predominant n-6polyunsaturated fatty acid(PUFA) in the Western diet and we can obtain it from vegetable oils such as sunflower, safflower, soybean, corn, and canola oils as well as nuts and seeds. A table spoon of soybean or corn oil contains about 7-8 g of linoleic acid, and 7 shelled walnuts provide about 11 g of linoleic acid. It should be noted that important sources of linoleic acid such as soybean and canola oils and walnuts also contain substantial amounts of alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid.
*For example, for a 2,000 calorie diet that would equal 100-200 calories from linoleic acid.
4. Your study also addresses claims that linoleic acid is pro-inflammatory. Can you explain what you found when you researched this?
Concerns have been raised about higher linoleic acid consumption being harmful for heart health because of potential pro-inflammatory and thrombogenicproperties. Linoleic acid can be elongated to arachidonic acid and subsequently synthesized to a variety of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which may increase CHD risk. But this speculation is not supported by randomized controlled feeding studies, in which dietary intake of linoleic acid was not found to increase plasma levels of arachidonic acid or inflammatory markers. On the contrary, some studies have found anti-inflammatory effects of diets higher in linoleic acid compared to those higher in saturated fat.
5. Based on this new study, what are some simple steps consumers can take to improve their diet?
Instead of using butter, cream, lard, and other animal fat as the primary source of culinary fat, one shoulduse liquid vegetable oilslike soybean, corn, olive, and canola oils for cooking, on salad and at the table. Although olive oil contains little linoleic acid, many studies have shown health benefits ofMediterranean dietsrich in olive oil. Nuts and seeds are also excellent sources of healthy fats.

üîó Dietary Fat and Disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/dietary-fat-and-disease/

The types of fats in your diet can affect the development of diabetes.
In a randomized controlled trial (27) aMediterranean dietsupplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, both rich sources of unsaturated fat, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events amongst patients with diabetes or other risk factors over a 4.8-year follow-up.
‚Äì High intake of olive oil, nuts, vegetables, fruits, and mainly whole grain cereals‚Äì Moderate intake of fish and poultry‚Äì Low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets‚Äì Wine in moderation, consumed with meals
Researchers once suspected an association between dietary fat and common cancers. However, in adults, the percentage of calories consumed from total fat appears to have no significant association with cancer risk, and there is currently no clear evidence linking any specific type of fat with cancer incidence.
Breast cancer
In the early 1980s, most nutrition experts believed that dietary fat was a major cause of breast cancer. (28,29) This thinking was largely based on international comparisons showing higher breast cancer rates in countries with higher per capita fat intake. But as more prospective studies and randomized controlled trials were performed over the next couple of decades, the apparent link between total fat intake and breast cancer has faded. (30)
Colon cancer
As with breast cancer, international comparisons initially suggested an association between total dietary fat intake and colon cancer risk. But later and better studies contradicted these earlier findings and revealed no significant association.
Prostate cancer
Although the exact connection between dietary fat and prostate cancer is unclear, there is some evidence that diets high in animal fat and saturated fat may increase prostate cancer risk. However, other studies have shown no association, while others have implicated unsaturated fats. More research is needed to elucidate any possible links between dietary fat and prostate cancer.
Other cancers
Preliminary research has also linked the intake of certain kinds of fat with other cancers, though more research is needed to confirm these results. In the Nurses‚Äô Health Study, Harvard researchers found that a high intake of trans fats was associated with risk for non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. (38)
There is a small but growing body of work on the effects of dietary fats on conditions such as depression, (39) osteoporosis, (40) age-related memory loss, (41) cognitive decline, (42) macular degeneration, (43) multiple sclerosis, (44) infertility and endometriosis, (45,46) and other chronic conditions. The preliminary findings do not offer sufficient evidence to suggest modifying dietary fat recommendations.

üîó Preventing Heart Disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/cardiovascular-disease/preventing-cvd/

When heart experts talk about prevention, they usually refer to one of three types: secondary, primary and primordial prevention. [1]¬†All three have similar elements, but different starting times and different effects.
Five key lifestyle steps can dramatically reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular risk factors and ultimately heart disease:
1. Not smoking
One of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form. Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life. One way it does this is by contributing to heart disease.
In fact, researchers examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on mortality during a decades-long perspective study of over 100,000 women found that approximately 64% of deaths among current smokers and 28% of deaths among former smokers were attributable to cigarette smoking. [2]
The nicotine that tobacco products deliver is one of the most addictive substances around. That makes tobacco use one of the toughest unhealthy habits to break. But don‚Äôt get discouraged; many smokers do quit! In fact, in the United States today there are more ex-smokers than smokers. [3]¬†Learn more about the hazards of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and tips for quitting from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
2. Maintaining a healthy weight
Excess weight and an extra-large waist size both contribute to heart disease, as well asa host of other health problems. [4-6]
In a study of over one million women, body-mass index (BMI) was a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease. The incidence of coronary heart disease increases progressively with BMI. [7]
In the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer.
Weight and height go hand-in-hand. The taller you are, the more you weigh. That‚Äôs why researchers have devised several measures that account for both weight and height. The one most commonly used isBMI.
3. Exercising
Exercise andphysical activityare excellent ways to prevent heart disease and many other diseases and conditions, [14-16] but many of us getlessactivity as we get older.
4. Following a healthy diet
For years, research into connections between diet and heart disease focused on individual nutrients like cholesterol (and foods high in dietary cholesterol, likeeggs), types of fats, and specific vitamins and minerals. This work has been revealing, but it has also generated some dead ends, along with myths and confusion about what constitutes a heart-healthy diet. That‚Äôs because people eatfood, not nutrients.
5. Improving sleep health
Research has shown thatsleepis an essential component of cardiovascular health.
Other factors to consider
Along with these five practices, the American Heart Association recommends controlling cholesterol, managing blood sugar, and managing blood pressure as additional factors for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health. Learn more at theAmerican Heart Association‚Äôs ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Essential 8.‚Äù

You can help prevent heart disease by doing five key things and making them into habits:
Strong studies make it possible to link reductions in risk to these habits. Following a healthy lifestyle may prevent over 80% of cases of coronary artery disease, [24, 25] 50% of ischemic strokes, [26] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [27] and 72% of premature deaths related to heart disease. [28] In other words, a healthy lifestyle is a good investment in a longer, healthier life.

üîó Dietary fat and heart disease study is seriously misleading
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2014/03/19/dietary-fat-and-heart-disease-study-is-seriously-misleading/

The journal Annals of Internal Medicine recently published apapersuggesting there is no evidence supporting the longstanding recommendation to limit saturated fat consumption. Media reporting on the paper included headlines such as ‚ÄúNo link found between saturated fat and heart disease‚Äù and articles saying ‚ÄúSaturated fat shouldn‚Äôt be demonized‚Äù springing up on social media.
However, Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, warns that the conclusions are seriously misleading, as the analysis contains major errors and omissions.
This paper is bound to cause confusion. A central issue is what replaces saturated fat if someone reduces the amount of saturated fat in their diet. If it is replaced with refined starch or sugar, which are the largest sources of calories in the U.S. diet, then the risk of heart disease remains the same. However, if saturated fat is replaced with polyunsaturated fat or monounsaturated fat in the form of olive oil, nuts and probably other plant oils, we have much evidence that risk will be reduced.
Dr. Willett emphasized that because this meta-analysis contains multiple serious errors and omissions, the study conclusions are misleading and should be disregarded.
The official comment, as it appears on theAnnals of Internal Medicine website, is as follows:
The meta-analysis of dietary fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease by Chowdhury et al. (1) contains multiple errors and omissions, and the conclusions are seriously misleading, particularly the lack of association with N-6 polyunsaturated fat. For example, two of the six studies included in the analysis of N-6 polyunsaturated fat were wrong. The relative risks for Nurses‚Äô Health Study (NHS) (2) and Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Study (KIHD) (3) were retrieved incorrectly and said to be above 1.0. However, in the 20-year follow-up of the NHS the relative risk for highest vs lowest quintile was 0.77 (95 percent CI: 0.62, 0.95); ptrend = 0.01 (the authors seem to have used the RR for N-3 alpha-linolenic acid from a paper on sudden cardiac death), and in the KIHD the relative risk was 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.71) (the origin of the number used in the meta-analysis is unclear). Also, relevant data from other studies were not included (4 and 5).
Further, the authors did not mention a pooled analysis (6) of the primary data from prospective studies, in which a significant inverse association between intake of polyunsaturated fat (the large majority being the N-6 linoleic acid) and risk of CHD was found. Also, in this analysis, substitution of polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat was associated with lower risk of CHD. Chowdhury et al. also failed to point out that most of the monounsaturated fat consumed in their studies was from red meat and dairy sources, and the findings do not necessarily apply to consumption in the form of nuts, olive oil, and other plant sources. Thus, the conclusions of Chowdhury et al. regarding the type of fat being unimportant are seriously misleading and should be disregarded.

üîó Nuts for the Heart
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nuts-for-the-heart/

Many people think of nuts as just another junk food snack. In reality, nuts are excellent sources ofhealthy fat,protein, and other healthful nutrients.
One surprising finding from nutrition research is that people who regularly eat nuts are less likely to have heart attacks or die fromheart diseasethan those who rarely eat them. Several of the largest cohort studies, including the Adventist Study, the Iowa Women‚Äôs Health Study, the Nurses‚Äô Health Study, and the Physicians‚Äô Health Study have shown a consistent 30 percent to 50 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or cardiovascular disease associated with eating nuts several times a week. In fact, the FDA now allows some nuts and foods made with them to carry this claim: ‚ÄúEating a diet that includes one ounce of nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease.‚Äù
There are several ways that nuts could have such an effect. The unsaturated fats they contain help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol. One group of unsaturated fat found in walnuts, the omega-3 fatty acids, appears to prevent the development of erratic heart rhythms.Omega-3 fatty acids(which are also found in fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish) may also prevent blood clots, much as aspirin does.

Coming up on Harvard Chan: This Week in Health‚Ä¶.Nuts and heart health.
{***Marta Guasch Soundbite***}
(We found that people who regularly eat nuts, including peanuts, walnuts, and tree nuts, have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease.)
In this week‚Äôs episode, a closer look at new research on the health benefits of nuts‚Äîincluding ways that you can include more in your diet.
{***Pause/Music***}
{***Amie***}
Hello and welcome to Harvard Chan: This Week in Health. It‚Äôs Thursday, December 7, 2017. I‚Äôm Amie Montemurro.
{***Noah***}
And I‚Äôm Noah Leavitt.
This week we‚Äôll be looking at two new studies out of the Harvard Chan School.
Later in the episode‚Äîwe‚Äôll tell you about research examining the effectiveness of strategies to increase physical activity on a large scale.
{***Amie***}
But first‚Äînuts and heart health.
In one of the largest studies to date about nuts, researchers found that eating several small servings of nuts each week may significantly lower your risk of heart attack or stroke.
{***Noah***}
Researchers analyzed data from more than 210,000 health professionals over as many as 32 years‚Äîand specifically looked at the effects of different kinds of nuts.
We spoke about the findings‚Äîincluding how many nuts you should be eating each week‚Äîwith one of the study‚Äôs authors, Marta Guasch, a research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.
{***Amie***}
And just a note before we dive into this interview‚Ä¶you will hear us talking a lot about peanuts‚Äîwhich are technically a legume. But researchers say peanuts are nutritionally similar to other nuts.
{***Noah***}
And I began our interview with Marta Guasch by asking her what differentiates this study from previous research on nuts.
{***Marta Guasch Interview***}
MARTA GUASCH: Previous evidence has shown that the frequent nut consumption is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and also cardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome. But most of these previous prospective studies have focused on total nut consumption in relation to the risk of cardiovascular disease. So the effect of specific types of nuts, such as walnuts and peanuts and also peanut butter, with cardiovascular disease and specific types of cardiovascular disease, such as stroke or coronary heart disease, was unclear. So we thought that analyzing the effect of several types of nuts, including total nuts, peanuts, walnuts, and tree nuts, and the relation with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and myocardial infarction could be of particular interest.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so what were some of your key findings in that regard?
MARTA GUASCH: So, yeah, briefly, in the three large prospective cohort studies, with up to 32 years of follow-up, we found that people who regularly eat nuts, including peanuts, walnuts, and tree nuts, have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and also coronary heart disease, compared to people who never or almost never consume nuts. And we found a consistent inverse association with total nut consumption and total cardiovascular disease of 14% lower risk for those consuming five or more times per week of total nuts, and 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease. And also, we find the specific benefict for consuming walnuts one or more times per week, and also for peanuts and tree nuts, both for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease.
NOAH LEAVITT: So people who were eating more nuts had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.
MARTA GUASCH: Yes. Exactly.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so you just touched on there, you know, one or more times a week. So when we talk about regular nut consumption, what types of quantities of consumption are we talking about?
MARTA GUASCH: So in our study for total nuts, we observed the greatest benefits for those people who consume a handful of nuts, which is equivalent to 28 grams, or one ounce, five or more times per week had the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease compared to those who never consume nuts. But we also observed the beneficial effects on those consuming two or four times per week of nuts.
And actually, when we evaluated the nut consumption as a continuous variable, which means that we show the effects for 28 grams increase in nuts consumption instead of the categories, we observed that each 28-gram increase in nut consumption was associated with 6% lower risk. So for peanuts and tree nuts, which are like specific types of nuts, consuming them at least two times per week, we observed a benefit. So probably, I‚Äôd say that consuming four to seven servings per week of nuts, of any types of nuts, in a context of a healthy diet would be a good amount of nuts to consume.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so you‚Äôve got that kind of context of healthy diet, I‚Äôm sure people are sitting there thinking, OK, well, nuts are great, but they have a lot of calories or a lot of fat. So I guess could you put people at ease and say, you know, I guess kind of give some perspective in terms of including nuts as part of a healthy diet. You know, what is a healthy amount, and should we be concerned about weight gain or anything like that.
MARTA GUASCH: Yeah, that‚Äôs a good question. Despite nuts being an energy dense food and the belief that they can increase weight gain, there is no scientific evidence supporting the associations between weight gain and nut consumption. And indeed, there have been some results showing that nut consumption is associated with lower weight gain, or lower risk of obesity. And that‚Äôs probably because they can increase satiety and fullness. And this may potentially reduce the consumption of other unhealthy snacks.
NOAH LEAVITT: So kind of one of the additional benefits is that handful of nuts might make you a little more full, so maybe you‚Äôre less likely to go eat‚Äì chips are kind of a less healthy snack. So, you know, I‚Äôm in the supermarket, I see all the nuts in front of me‚Äì the almonds, the walnuts, the peanuts. I mean, are there any kind of nuts that you found were more beneficial than others?
MARTA GUASCH: Well actually, in our study, not really. We have observed benefits for total nuts, peanuts, tree nuts, and walnuts. They were all associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. And the intake of peanuts and walnuts was additionally associated with lower risk of stroke. However, what we observed was that peanut butter was not significantly associated with cardiovascular disease. This doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs harmful, it‚Äôs just that we didn‚Äôt observe an official association. So probably more studies on this line need to be done.
We believe that one of the reasons why we didn‚Äôt observe significant associations is because usually peanut butter is consumed with unhealthy foods, such as white bread or other processed foods with high amount of sugar. And this unhealthy pattern associated with the peanut butter consumption may have obscured some of the potential benefits of peanut butter.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so that‚Äôd kind of be a good piece of advice, too. I mean, people might see nuts, and they might see a trail mix filled with peanuts and candies. I mean, So it‚Äôs kind of important to‚Äì I guess maybe the important point is that, if you‚Äôre eating nuts, they should just be nuts on their own. I‚Äôm guessing unsalted nuts might be best.
MARTA GUASCH: Yeah, that‚Äôs really a good question. Actually, that‚Äôs one of probably our limitations of the study, because we were unable to differentiate between the type of nuts, so the preparation of nuts, just the total amount of nuts. But we believe that the consumption of raw or roasted nuts is beneficial for health, but if the nuts are covered in chocolate or have high amounts of sugar or high amounts of sodium, they are probably not as good.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so I know this was a really large study, I think 210,000 people. But as you just kind of hinted at, there are some limitations. So I guess what would be kind of further questions that you or other researchers would want to address with regards to nut consumption and cardiovascular disease?
MARTA GUASCH: So I think that one of the questions is understanding more of the mechanisms which explain these associations between nut consumption and cardiovascular disease, for example with novel techniques, such as metabolomics, genomics, or other techniques that can help us understand these underlying mechanisms. Also, another important thing could be to evaluate the differences among these preparation methods that we‚Äôve just talked about, like the different types of nuts, and maybe also to further elucidate the effects of peanut butter on health could be another line that could be interesting, too.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so you just kind of hinted at mechanisms there. So I mean, do we know a lot about why nuts might be beneficial, or is that still not exactly clear?
MARTA GUASCH: I think that one of the main reasons why we believe that nuts can be beneficial for health are because they are high in unsaturated fatty acids, also dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and other bioactive compounds. And there‚Äôs some evidence that has shown that nuts can improve blood lipids, they can attenuate inflammation, they can be also beneficial for endothelial function and decreased insulin resistance or glucose intolerance. So all these mechanisms can explain the lower risk on cardiovascular disease that we have observed because they are strong risk factors of cardiovascular disease.
NOAH LEAVITT: How do these findings fit into larger nutritional advice, especially with regards to I think there‚Äôs now this awareness that healthy fat consumption is a good thing, but also maybe reduced consumption of animal proteins can be positive. So how do your findings fit into this kind of larger nutritional context?
MARTA GUASCH: Yeah. So recently, dietary recommendations have shifted towards diets including higher quantities of plant-based foods over animal foods, with most dietary patterns also including nuts because their association with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors because of their unique nutritional composition. So nuts are a good source of healthy fats, including mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats, and they are also rich in plant-based protein, minerals and fiber. So they can really fit well into healthy diets that emphasize more plant-based foods, specifically because they can help and they can be a good source to substitute for animal foods, such as red meat or other processed meats.
NOAH LEAVITT: Is there any general advice for people looking to get more nuts into their diet, or is it as simple as just maybe keep a jar at work and just take a handful, you know, every day for a snack?
MARTA GUASCH: I think that several things can be done to increase the consumption of nuts. One may be just to use it as a snack, as a healthy snack in, like, the morning or the afternoon. Just a handful of nuts would be a healthy snack compared to eating other things. But they can be also included, like, in salads or with yogurt or with fruit as a way to increase the consumption.
{***Noah***}
That was our interview with Marta Guasch about nuts and heart health.
{***Amie***}
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about her research‚Äîand the larger health benefits of nuts, we‚Äôll have some information on our website, hsph.me/thisweekinhealth.
{***Noah***}
And now we shift gears from healthy eating‚Äîto another beneficial habit‚Äîphysical activity.
{***Amie***}
The health benefits of exercise are well-known, but getting people to actually be active is much more of a challenge.
{***Masamitsu Kamada Soundbite***}
(Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle remains highly prevalent globally. So, effective population strategies to promote physical activity are necessary to reduce the global burden of noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, stemming from physical inactivity.
{***Amie***}
That‚Äôs Masamitsu Kamada, a research fellow in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences here at the Harvard Chan School.
{***Noah***}
Kamada and colleagues recently tested one strategy to promote physical activity on a large scale.
And their study was unique for a couple of reasons.
{***Amie***}
Kamada told us that most studies on physical activity interventions are not high-quality enough or long enough to effectively measure what works.
{***Noah***}
That might mean that the population being study isn‚Äôt large enough‚Äîor researchers weren‚Äôt able to follow participants long enough to measure the benefit of an intervention.
{***Amie***}
In this case Kamada and his colleagues conducted a five-year randomized trial of a community-wide intervention in Unnan City, Japan.
It‚Äôs a city of about 44,000 people‚Äîand more than 4,400 people were involved in the study.
{***Noah***}
They were testing a program that aimed to improve physical activity through social marketing‚Äîso informing and educating people about the benefits of physical activity through posters, news reports, and even the use of high-profile influencers.
{***Amie***}
The campaign focused on three types of activities: aerobic, flexibility, and muscle-strengthening.
Questionnaires were then sent to the participants one year, three years, and five years after the study began to measure their level of physical activity.
{***Noah***}
Overall researchers say this intervention was successful at promoting all three types of physical activity.
But the style of messaging was important‚Äîthe campaign was most successful when it focused on a specific type of activity‚Äîas opposed to generally promoting all three.
{***Masamitsu Kamada Soundbite***}
(The intervention was effective for promoting all types of recommended physical activities. That is, aerobic, flexibility, and the muscle strengthening activities. But interestingly, a bundled approach‚Äì or in other words, an all-in-one approach‚Äì was not effective. This means we failed when we attempted to promote all types of physical activities simultaneously. So maybe the key message is one thing at one time. Dissemination of knowledge doesn‚Äôt assure dissemination of behavior. So we need more sophisticated strategies and approaches to change actual behavior or, in this case, physical activity.)
{***Noah***}
Researchers say another key takeaway is that one year was not enough to see an effect‚Äîwhich means that communities do need to invest in long-term interventions.
{***Amie***}
Kamada says that the intervention also does not address the other factors that can affect a person‚Äôs ability to be active‚Äîsuch as the built environment or social and psychological factors.
{***Noah***}
Kamada says more research is needed to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to address these factors.
{***Amie***}
That‚Äôs all for this week‚Äôs episode‚Äîa reminder that if you‚Äôd like to learn more about either of the studies we discussed in this episode, you can visit hsph.me/thisweekinhealth.
{***Noah***}
A reminder that you can always find older episodes of our podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, and Soundcloud.
Nuts are rich in arginine, an amino acid needed to make a molecule called nitric oxide that relaxes constricted blood vessels and eases blood flow. They also contain vitamin E,folate, potassium, fiber, and other healthful nutrients. Because different nuts supply a different mix of nutrients, it‚Äôs a good idea to incorporate a variety of nuts into ahealthy eating plan.
Of course, eating nuts won‚Äôt do much good if you gobble them in addition to usual snacks and meals. At an average of 185 calories per ounce, a handful of walnuts a day could add 10 pounds or more in a year if you don‚Äôt cut back on something else. This weight gain would tip the scales toward heart disease, not away from it. Instead, eat nuts instead of chips or other, less healthy snacks. Or try using them instead of meat inmain dishes, or as a healthful crunch in salads.

üîó Electrolyte Drinks
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/electrolyte-drinks/

Move over plain water? Commercial beverages in the U.S. aside from alcohol are a multi-billion-dollar industry and growing rapidly. Fueled by strong consumer interest in fitness and wellness, electrolyte orsports drinkscomprise a large share of the beverage market. They were originally created to prevent dehydration and electrolyte loss in young athletes who sweat and trained for hours in hot weather, which could hinder performance. Electrolyte beverages are designed to be easily absorbed in the gut to quickly rebalance mineral and fluid levels.
Eventually, marketing of the drinks shifted to a much larger audience: the non-athlete fitness enthusiast, which included anyone who donned a pair of sneakers for a weekly workout. Labeled ‚Äúhydration drinks,‚Äù they claim to hydrate even better than water. Others advertise a boost in energy and fitness performance thanks to added B vitamins and caffeine. Some containlow-calorie sweetenersto enhance flavor. They‚Äôre sold in ready-to-drink bottles or as supplements in tablet and powdered form that are added to plain water.
Electrolytes are minerals that have an electrical charge when dissolved in water. Electrical charges are needed to contract muscles, regulate heart rhythms, and maintain healthy fluid levels inside and outside of cells. Electrolyte minerals includesodium,potassium,magnesium,phosphorus,calcium, andchloride.
Because electrolytes are so vital to the body‚Äôs automatic functions, their blood levels are tightly regulated, meaning that your blood level does not always reflect how much you are eating (or not eating) of that mineral. Healthy kidneys can excrete excess amounts of electrolytes through urine if blood levels are too high (such as after eating a salt-loaded Italian sub) as well as hold onto body water if electrolyte levels are too low.
A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean protein foods naturally provides adequate amounts of electrolytes that our bodies need. But not everyone eats a consistently balanced diet, and certain medical conditions, drugs, and situations can cause dehydration and a deficiency in these minerals
Some beverages naturally contain electrolytes. Examples include:
Essentially any beverage containing electrolyte minerals may be labeled an electrolyte drink. Commercial electrolyte-branded waters and tablets contain varying ratios of electrolyte minerals. Some are very costly while offering only a small amount of these nutrients, while others may contain a high amount of only one nutrient such as potassium or sodium.
When an exercise workout is less than one hour and of lower intensity performed in moderate temperatures,plain wateris the best choice. Eating a balanced meal or a snack such as a banana with peanut butter,yogurtand pretzels, or chocolate milk shortly after a workout can naturally and safely replete electrolytes.
To save money and better control the ingredients, a homemade electrolyte drink is easy to make. The ratio of ingredients ‚Äì including electrolyte minerals, water, and a small amount of glucose in the form of sugar or honey ‚Äì enhances the absorption of fluid and electrolytes into the intestines.
Basic Electrolyte Water Recipe (makes about 1 liter):
Conditions that cause the body to lose large amounts of fluid in a short time increase the risk of nutrient depletion, as minerals are carried away with the fluid. Examples areexcessive diarrhea, vomiting, or sweatingthat can occur from viral infections, food-borne illnesses, gastrointestinal disorders, and strenuous physical activity usually longer than 1-2 hours such as withtrained athletes. Excessive alcohol intake can also cause the kidneys to excrete too much fluid from the body, carrying minerals with it.
Some medical conditions or medications reduce the absorption of minerals in the body, or require an increased intake of minerals. These include:
Electrolyte beverages andsports drinksare popular alternatives towaterbecause they add flavor and are touted to hydrate better than water. They are also heavily marketed through the billion-dollar beverage industry. Although electrolyte drinks may be useful for performance athletes who are regularly training or for those who have underlying medical conditions that place them at risk for electrolyte depletion, there is no evidence that these are healthier choices than water for the average person. Some commercial electrolyte beverages are costly, and contain extra calories from added sweeteners and high amounts of minerals like sodium that may have adverse effects in some people. Electrolytes can naturally be obtained from abalanced healthy diet.

üîó Probiotics for Gut Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/probiotics/

Probiotics‚Äîwhether from food or supplements‚Äîare a hot topic of consumer interest. However, would a relatively healthy person benefit from supplementation of probiotics, or is a fiber-rich diet sufficient for cultivating a robust gut microbiome? Learn more about probiotics, and review available research on supplements and health.
Probiotics are dubbed the ‚Äúgood gut bugs‚Äù that live in our digestive tract. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes that make up what we callthe gut microbiome. Each person‚Äôs microbiome is different, influenced by what we eat, our lifestyle habits, our genes, and environment. Although studies have shown that the types and amounts of gut bugs differ between healthy individuals and those with disease, and that many health experts believe that a diversity of bacteria in the colon is beneficial, what a healthy gut microbiome looks like is still unknown, as it would likely vary from person to person.
However, there are known probiotics that live in the human intestine, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium. TheWorld Health Organization defines probioticsas ‚Äúlive microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.‚ÄùEarly research on probioticsused nonharmful bacteria to change or replace intestinal microbes in patients who had intestinal disorders or diarrhea.
Prebiotics consist of non-digestible fermentable carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics. An example is oligofructose naturally found in wheat, onions, banana, garlic, leeks, and chicory root or inulin. The fermentation of prebiotics by gut bacteria may help increase the amount of beneficial bacteria strains in the colon, prevent the growth of potential pathogens, reduce constipation, support healthy immune function, and lower blood cholesterol levels.
Synbioticsare supplements that contain a mix of probiotics and prebiotics, with the intention that the bacterial strains are fed and thrive in the gut.Postbioticsare the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù made by gut bacteria after digesting prebiotic fibers, which can include beneficial short-chain fatty acids and vitamin K.
These are terms promoted by industry, as they are marketed as supplements alongside probiotics. However, at this time there is little quality scientific evidence supporting the use of prebiotic, symbiotic, and postbiotic supplements to improve health.
Probiotics can be found naturally in or added to certain foods and beverages, and are sold as supplements.
Foods that are fermented tend to contain probiotics, such as:
However, to cultivate a robust gut microbiome, rather than adding just these foods to your diet, focus on implementing a long-term dietary pattern rich in various types of fibers fromfruits, vegetables,whole grains,beans,nuts, and seeds that act as prebiotics.
Fermented foods are foods or beverages that are produced with the intentional, controlled growth of microorganisms with the conversion of food components by enzymes. Historically, fermentation was commonly used to preserve foods as it protected the food from contamination by pathogenic bacteria. It also imparts a unique taste and texture to foods created by the specific types of bacteria used. Certain foods like olives are inedible without fermentation that removes bitter compounds. Fermented foods may benefit the gut microbiome, promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, and support ahealthy immune system.
Processing of fermented foods, such as by heating, baking, or pasteurization, reduces or kills probiotics. So popular foods like sourdough bread and commercially prepared fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut do not contain probiotics unless they have been added back (the label may state ‚Äúcontains live and active cultures‚Äù). Additionally, theInternational Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics statethat the term ‚Äúprobiotic‚Äù should not be used interchangeably with ‚Äúfermented foods.‚Äù Instead, fermented foods should be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù only when there is evidence that the live microbes provide health benefits.For example, yogurt is a fermented food but should only be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù if the bacterial strains used in its production have been shown to provide health benefits.
You may be surprised to see probiotics advertised on packages of chocolate, cookies, juices, and tea as the food industry has cashed in on growing consumer interest in digestive health and probiotic supplements by conveniently including them in common foods and beverages.
Be wary ofultraprocessed foodsadvertising on front of label, ‚Äúincludes probiotics (or prebiotics) to support digestive health.‚Äù This addition may create a favorable impression of their nutritional value but does not make brownies and chips suddenly healthful. Manufacturers also tend to choose familiar-sounding bacterial strains that a consumer will recognize and be more likely to purchase.
There is overwhelming scientific evidence of the harmful health effects ofsoda and sugary drinks. While soda intake has declined, sodas containing prebiotics have surged in popularity, thanks to the inclusion ofa fiber called inulinand growing consumer interest in gut health. Inulin is naturally found in small amounts in fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, artichokes, and asparagus. But the type found in ultra-processed foods is usually extracted from chicory root and blended into sweet foods like brownies, yogurt, nutrition bars ‚Äì and now sodas. These sodas are sweetened with sugar but contain much less than traditional sodas per 12-ounces: about 4-5 grams compared with 40 grams in a cola drink. A soda lower in sugar and containing fiber, especially a fiber type that boasts ‚Äúprebiotics for gut health‚Äù is surely attractive to a consumer. However, it is unproven that the small amount of prebiotics in these sodas will truly improve gut health, and drinking more of them daily to potentially achieve gut health also drives up sugar intake. In fact, aclass action lawsuit was filed in 2024against one of these soda manufacturers due to false health claims.
The best use for these prebiotic sodas might be to replace a traditional soda if you‚Äôre trying to wean down and lower sugar intake. But they should not be viewed as a health beverage, and remember that the more you drink, the sugar will add up. Check outHealthy Drinksfor best beverage options.
In 2013, global sales of probiotic supplements was $32 billion, and ispredicted to reach $85 billion by 2027.
In 2020, the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics expanded the definition of probiotics marketed as supplements to include their genus, species, strain, alphanumeric strain designation, and commercial name. For example:
‚Ä†¬†The inclusion of this brand-name is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.
Thesupplement industryas a whole is fraught with uncertainties: the quality of products from different sources can vary, and supplement manufacturers do not always have quality control programs in place. Sometimes a probiotic supplement contains lower than the stated dose of bacterial strains or may even contain different types of strains than are listed.
The quality of probiotic supplements depends on the manufacturer.Important factors includean assurance of potency (ensuring live bacteria in the amounts listed, typically in colony-forming units [CFU] through the end of shelf-life), purity (manufacturing processes that reduce the introduction of harmful pathogens), and identity (current nomenclature used to specify the genus, species, and subspecies, if applicable, and a strain designation for each strain in the product). Live probiotics are susceptible to dying during storage, which manufacturers account for when listing the potency and CFU. Responsible manufacturers will include the dose expected at the use-by date.
There is tremendous interest in the use of probiotic supplements to treat various health conditions or for boosting immunity. As a consumer, you may see attractive claims of health benefits on supplement labels, but be wary as good-quality scientific evidence is still limited and conflicting as to which strains benefit which health conditions, effective doses, single versus multi-strain types, and an optimal length of time to use them. It can be difficult to disentangle scientific evidence from enticing marketing claims.
Probiotic supplements are backed by a billion-dollar industry that often funds published research that shows positive findings about their specific bacterial strain(s). Even if studies, particularly meta-analyses, do not show author disclosures of conflicts of interest, this does not guarantee there are not embedded financial ties. Do not be surprised if your physician or health care practitioner does not recommend probiotic supplements, which is based on low-quality evidence on their efficacy.
Due to lack of high-quality evidence and a largely unregulated supplement industry, buyer beware should be heeded. TheAmerican Gastroenterological Association released practice guidelines in 2020on probiotic supplements to manage gastrointestinal disorders, and concluded only a few conditions in which they may benefit.They determined that drawing conclusions on probiotic research is difficult due to studies including different strains of microbes used, different doses, and different routes of administration, as well as differences in how the study was conducted and including only small numbers of patients followed for short periods.
That said, research is ongoing and some people find benefit in taking probiotic supplements for specific conditions in the short-term. Multi-strain types (more than one bacterial strain in the supplement) have not necessarily been found more effective than single-strain types. The following conditions have shown low-quality evidence for probiotic use:
As a rule, always discuss supplement use, including probiotics, with your doctor.
There are several species of microbes such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that are naturally found in the human colon and considered to be safe (not pathogenic). However, people who have weakened immune systems, are taking immunosuppressant drugs, or have severe disease conditions should not use probiotic supplements, because in specific cases they have beenassociated with harmful overgrowth or led to health complications.
Probiotics have skyrocketed in consumer popularity. However, there is often industry funding for probiotic research, which can skew results in favor of using the supplements. Despite the hype, there exists mostly low-quality evidence for probiotic supplements. A relatively healthy person would not likely benefit from their use, and those with weakened immune systems should avoid them.
Research is ongoing, and the decision to use supplements should be preceded with caution, with an awareness that there is a level of ‚Äúmanufactured importance‚Äù created by industry. General recommendations for probiotics cannot be made, and people should not use them loosely, because each person‚Äôs gut microbiome is unique with different bacterial strains that are optimal for them.
Because the safety and effectiveness of probiotic supplements is unclear, theWorld Gastroenterology Organisation recommendsthat if clinicians advise probiotic supplements to patients, the strains, doses, and length of use should only be that of those used in human trials that were shown to be beneficial.However, most consumers and doctorsdo not have access to or the abilityto sort through probiotics research, to be able to differentiate among various probiotics products.
A safer natural way tocultivate a healthy gut microbiomeis to implement a dietary pattern that includes a variety of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes that will ‚Äúfeed‚Äù favorable gut bugs. This can include fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics.

üîó Preventing Obesity
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/preventing-obesity/

Let‚Äôs be clear: To make strides in reversing theobesity epidemic, changes must come from all parts of society‚Äîfrom governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organizations, neighborhoods and communities. Effective policies and programs are essential in ensuring that children and adults live, work, and play inenvironments that are conducive to healthy eatingand offeropportunities for physical activity.
Personal preferences and knowledge or beliefs can influence lifestyle choices, but there are so many complex factors that strongly impact individual behaviors. This page covers individual- and family-level strategies associated with maintaining a healthy weight, with the acknowledgement that we are too often fighting against a flood of accessible unhealthy options, persuasive advertising, and policies that make it far from easy.
Preventing weight gain over the years may not be possible for everyone, but there are strategies to help reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. Most of these strategies are covered in-depth throughout the website, so keep an eye out for links to more information below.
Nutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and ahealthy eating patternis crucial to good health. Additionally,howwe eat matters too.
Eat and drink these:
Eat and drink less of these:
How we eat and how much:
Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how much food you need each day to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it‚Äôs far too easy to overeat. Try the tips below to avoid overeating.
After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness. Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1. This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss. GLP-1 RAs also lower blood sugar by triggering the release of insulin. Early research has also found these drugs to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack.
GLP-1 RAs are used to treat both diabetes and obesity, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved specific dosages and brand names for each condition. Ozempic (semaglutide), Victoza (liraglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are prescribed for diabetes, and Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide) are prescribed for obesity. Rates of weight loss have been substantial, with tirzepatide achieving up to 21% weight loss in 18 months, comparable to 25-30% weight loss achieved with gastric bypass surgery. [1] Unpleasant side effects of GLP-1 RAs are mostly gastrointestinal, with 58% of users in one study reporting stomach pain; other common complaints are constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most of reported GI side effects appear to be mild and moderate. [2] Pancreatitis and gastroparesis (severely decreased stomach emptying) are less common but appear in a small percentage of users. Clinical trials such as SURMOUNT-4 and STEP 1 have shown that discontinuation of the medications causes weight regain, although it should be noted that these trials are authored by scientists who have affiliations with pharmaceutical companies that produce these medications. [3,4]
Shortages of GLP-1 RAs have led to the creation of falsified versions that are sold through unregulated outlets. They are discouraged by the World Health Organization, as falsified medications may lack efficacy, cause toxic reactions, and may be produced in unhygienic conditions that lead to bacterial contamination. [5]
Regular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions. In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit ‚Äúsit time‚Äù or being sedentary.SeeStaying Activefor further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages.
Watching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits.
Chronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight. Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise.SeeSleepfor more guidance.
Today‚Äôs world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities.
Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies.SeeStress and Healthfor more information and tips.

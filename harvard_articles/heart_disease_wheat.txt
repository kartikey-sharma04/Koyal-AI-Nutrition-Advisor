üîó Probiotics for Gut Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/probiotics/

Probiotics‚Äîwhether from food or supplements‚Äîare a hot topic of consumer interest. However, would a relatively healthy person benefit from supplementation of probiotics, or is a fiber-rich diet sufficient for cultivating a robust gut microbiome? Learn more about probiotics, and review available research on supplements and health.
Probiotics are dubbed the ‚Äúgood gut bugs‚Äù that live in our digestive tract. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes that make up what we callthe gut microbiome. Each person‚Äôs microbiome is different, influenced by what we eat, our lifestyle habits, our genes, and environment. Although studies have shown that the types and amounts of gut bugs differ between healthy individuals and those with disease, and that many health experts believe that a diversity of bacteria in the colon is beneficial, what a healthy gut microbiome looks like is still unknown, as it would likely vary from person to person.
However, there are known probiotics that live in the human intestine, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium. TheWorld Health Organization defines probioticsas ‚Äúlive microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.‚ÄùEarly research on probioticsused nonharmful bacteria to change or replace intestinal microbes in patients who had intestinal disorders or diarrhea.
Prebiotics consist of non-digestible fermentable carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics. An example is oligofructose naturally found in wheat, onions, banana, garlic, leeks, and chicory root or inulin. The fermentation of prebiotics by gut bacteria may help increase the amount of beneficial bacteria strains in the colon, prevent the growth of potential pathogens, reduce constipation, support healthy immune function, and lower blood cholesterol levels.
Synbioticsare supplements that contain a mix of probiotics and prebiotics, with the intention that the bacterial strains are fed and thrive in the gut.Postbioticsare the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù made by gut bacteria after digesting prebiotic fibers, which can include beneficial short-chain fatty acids and vitamin K.
These are terms promoted by industry, as they are marketed as supplements alongside probiotics. However, at this time there is little quality scientific evidence supporting the use of prebiotic, symbiotic, and postbiotic supplements to improve health.
Probiotics can be found naturally in or added to certain foods and beverages, and are sold as supplements.
Foods that are fermented tend to contain probiotics, such as:
However, to cultivate a robust gut microbiome, rather than adding just these foods to your diet, focus on implementing a long-term dietary pattern rich in various types of fibers fromfruits, vegetables,whole grains,beans,nuts, and seeds that act as prebiotics.
Fermented foods are foods or beverages that are produced with the intentional, controlled growth of microorganisms with the conversion of food components by enzymes. Historically, fermentation was commonly used to preserve foods as it protected the food from contamination by pathogenic bacteria. It also imparts a unique taste and texture to foods created by the specific types of bacteria used. Certain foods like olives are inedible without fermentation that removes bitter compounds. Fermented foods may benefit the gut microbiome, promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, and support ahealthy immune system.
Processing of fermented foods, such as by heating, baking, or pasteurization, reduces or kills probiotics. So popular foods like sourdough bread and commercially prepared fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut do not contain probiotics unless they have been added back (the label may state ‚Äúcontains live and active cultures‚Äù). Additionally, theInternational Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics statethat the term ‚Äúprobiotic‚Äù should not be used interchangeably with ‚Äúfermented foods.‚Äù Instead, fermented foods should be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù only when there is evidence that the live microbes provide health benefits.For example, yogurt is a fermented food but should only be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù if the bacterial strains used in its production have been shown to provide health benefits.
You may be surprised to see probiotics advertised on packages of chocolate, cookies, juices, and tea as the food industry has cashed in on growing consumer interest in digestive health and probiotic supplements by conveniently including them in common foods and beverages.
Be wary ofultraprocessed foodsadvertising on front of label, ‚Äúincludes probiotics (or prebiotics) to support digestive health.‚Äù This addition may create a favorable impression of their nutritional value but does not make brownies and chips suddenly healthful. Manufacturers also tend to choose familiar-sounding bacterial strains that a consumer will recognize and be more likely to purchase.
There is overwhelming scientific evidence of the harmful health effects ofsoda and sugary drinks. While soda intake has declined, sodas containing prebiotics have surged in popularity, thanks to the inclusion ofa fiber called inulinand growing consumer interest in gut health. Inulin is naturally found in small amounts in fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, artichokes, and asparagus. But the type found in ultra-processed foods is usually extracted from chicory root and blended into sweet foods like brownies, yogurt, nutrition bars ‚Äì and now sodas. These sodas are sweetened with sugar but contain much less than traditional sodas per 12-ounces: about 4-5 grams compared with 40 grams in a cola drink. A soda lower in sugar and containing fiber, especially a fiber type that boasts ‚Äúprebiotics for gut health‚Äù is surely attractive to a consumer. However, it is unproven that the small amount of prebiotics in these sodas will truly improve gut health, and drinking more of them daily to potentially achieve gut health also drives up sugar intake. In fact, aclass action lawsuit was filed in 2024against one of these soda manufacturers due to false health claims.
The best use for these prebiotic sodas might be to replace a traditional soda if you‚Äôre trying to wean down and lower sugar intake. But they should not be viewed as a health beverage, and remember that the more you drink, the sugar will add up. Check outHealthy Drinksfor best beverage options.
In 2013, global sales of probiotic supplements was $32 billion, and ispredicted to reach $85 billion by 2027.
In 2020, the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics expanded the definition of probiotics marketed as supplements to include their genus, species, strain, alphanumeric strain designation, and commercial name. For example:
‚Ä†¬†The inclusion of this brand-name is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.
Thesupplement industryas a whole is fraught with uncertainties: the quality of products from different sources can vary, and supplement manufacturers do not always have quality control programs in place. Sometimes a probiotic supplement contains lower than the stated dose of bacterial strains or may even contain different types of strains than are listed.
The quality of probiotic supplements depends on the manufacturer.Important factors includean assurance of potency (ensuring live bacteria in the amounts listed, typically in colony-forming units [CFU] through the end of shelf-life), purity (manufacturing processes that reduce the introduction of harmful pathogens), and identity (current nomenclature used to specify the genus, species, and subspecies, if applicable, and a strain designation for each strain in the product). Live probiotics are susceptible to dying during storage, which manufacturers account for when listing the potency and CFU. Responsible manufacturers will include the dose expected at the use-by date.
There is tremendous interest in the use of probiotic supplements to treat various health conditions or for boosting immunity. As a consumer, you may see attractive claims of health benefits on supplement labels, but be wary as good-quality scientific evidence is still limited and conflicting as to which strains benefit which health conditions, effective doses, single versus multi-strain types, and an optimal length of time to use them. It can be difficult to disentangle scientific evidence from enticing marketing claims.
Probiotic supplements are backed by a billion-dollar industry that often funds published research that shows positive findings about their specific bacterial strain(s). Even if studies, particularly meta-analyses, do not show author disclosures of conflicts of interest, this does not guarantee there are not embedded financial ties. Do not be surprised if your physician or health care practitioner does not recommend probiotic supplements, which is based on low-quality evidence on their efficacy.
Due to lack of high-quality evidence and a largely unregulated supplement industry, buyer beware should be heeded. TheAmerican Gastroenterological Association released practice guidelines in 2020on probiotic supplements to manage gastrointestinal disorders, and concluded only a few conditions in which they may benefit.They determined that drawing conclusions on probiotic research is difficult due to studies including different strains of microbes used, different doses, and different routes of administration, as well as differences in how the study was conducted and including only small numbers of patients followed for short periods.
That said, research is ongoing and some people find benefit in taking probiotic supplements for specific conditions in the short-term. Multi-strain types (more than one bacterial strain in the supplement) have not necessarily been found more effective than single-strain types. The following conditions have shown low-quality evidence for probiotic use:
As a rule, always discuss supplement use, including probiotics, with your doctor.
There are several species of microbes such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that are naturally found in the human colon and considered to be safe (not pathogenic). However, people who have weakened immune systems, are taking immunosuppressant drugs, or have severe disease conditions should not use probiotic supplements, because in specific cases they have beenassociated with harmful overgrowth or led to health complications.
Probiotics have skyrocketed in consumer popularity. However, there is often industry funding for probiotic research, which can skew results in favor of using the supplements. Despite the hype, there exists mostly low-quality evidence for probiotic supplements. A relatively healthy person would not likely benefit from their use, and those with weakened immune systems should avoid them.
Research is ongoing, and the decision to use supplements should be preceded with caution, with an awareness that there is a level of ‚Äúmanufactured importance‚Äù created by industry. General recommendations for probiotics cannot be made, and people should not use them loosely, because each person‚Äôs gut microbiome is unique with different bacterial strains that are optimal for them.
Because the safety and effectiveness of probiotic supplements is unclear, theWorld Gastroenterology Organisation recommendsthat if clinicians advise probiotic supplements to patients, the strains, doses, and length of use should only be that of those used in human trials that were shown to be beneficial.However, most consumers and doctorsdo not have access to or the abilityto sort through probiotics research, to be able to differentiate among various probiotics products.
A safer natural way tocultivate a healthy gut microbiomeis to implement a dietary pattern that includes a variety of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes that will ‚Äúfeed‚Äù favorable gut bugs. This can include fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics.

üîó Preventing Obesity
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/preventing-obesity/

Let‚Äôs be clear: To make strides in reversing theobesity epidemic, changes must come from all parts of society‚Äîfrom governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organizations, neighborhoods and communities. Effective policies and programs are essential in ensuring that children and adults live, work, and play inenvironments that are conducive to healthy eatingand offeropportunities for physical activity.
Personal preferences and knowledge or beliefs can influence lifestyle choices, but there are so many complex factors that strongly impact individual behaviors. This page covers individual- and family-level strategies associated with maintaining a healthy weight, with the acknowledgement that we are too often fighting against a flood of accessible unhealthy options, persuasive advertising, and policies that make it far from easy.
Preventing weight gain over the years may not be possible for everyone, but there are strategies to help reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. Most of these strategies are covered in-depth throughout the website, so keep an eye out for links to more information below.
Nutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and ahealthy eating patternis crucial to good health. Additionally,howwe eat matters too.
Eat and drink these:
Eat and drink less of these:
How we eat and how much:
Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how much food you need each day to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it‚Äôs far too easy to overeat. Try the tips below to avoid overeating.
After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness. Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1. This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss. GLP-1 RAs also lower blood sugar by triggering the release of insulin. Early research has also found these drugs to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack.
GLP-1 RAs are used to treat both diabetes and obesity, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved specific dosages and brand names for each condition. Ozempic (semaglutide), Victoza (liraglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are prescribed for diabetes, and Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide) are prescribed for obesity. Rates of weight loss have been substantial, with tirzepatide achieving up to 21% weight loss in 18 months, comparable to 25-30% weight loss achieved with gastric bypass surgery. [1] Unpleasant side effects of GLP-1 RAs are mostly gastrointestinal, with 58% of users in one study reporting stomach pain; other common complaints are constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most of reported GI side effects appear to be mild and moderate. [2] Pancreatitis and gastroparesis (severely decreased stomach emptying) are less common but appear in a small percentage of users. Clinical trials such as SURMOUNT-4 and STEP 1 have shown that discontinuation of the medications causes weight regain, although it should be noted that these trials are authored by scientists who have affiliations with pharmaceutical companies that produce these medications. [3,4]
Shortages of GLP-1 RAs have led to the creation of falsified versions that are sold through unregulated outlets. They are discouraged by the World Health Organization, as falsified medications may lack efficacy, cause toxic reactions, and may be produced in unhygienic conditions that lead to bacterial contamination. [5]
Regular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions. In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit ‚Äúsit time‚Äù or being sedentary.SeeStaying Activefor further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages.
Watching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits.
Chronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight. Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise.SeeSleepfor more guidance.
Today‚Äôs world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities.
Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies.SeeStress and Healthfor more information and tips.

üîó Molybdenum
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/molybdenum/

Molybdenum is an essential trace mineral that occurs naturally in foods and is available in supplements. It is a component of four different enzymes in the body that help break down proteins, alcohol, drugs, and toxins. Molybdenum-containing enzymes also break down purines and sulfites. Purines are compounds metabolized from food that form uric acid which, in elevated levels, is a risk factor for gout. Sulfites are a preservative added to certain foods to maintain color and shelf-life; some people develop a sensitivity to sulfites, causing an allergic reaction. Molybdenum is stored in the liver, kidneys, and bone. The kidneys are efficient at removing excess amounts in the body if not needed.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years is 45 micrograms daily. People 14+ years who are pregnant or lactating require 50 micrograms daily.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for molybdenum for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 2,000 micrograms daily.
Research is not available on molybdenum as a treatment for specific diseases or health conditions in humans. [1]
Molybdenum is mostly found inlegumesbut is also available fromwhole grainsand beef liver. [1] The amount found in food varies depending on how much is present in the soil and water in which the food was grown.
A molybdenum deficiency is extremely rare in the U.S. Rare cases have been reported in infants with a genetic disorder in which the mineral cannot be use and therefore cannot break down sulfites, which may lead to brain damage and seizures. A deficiency has also been seen in people receiving intravenous nutrition in which supplemental molybdenum was not added.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals. It has been reported in people with occupations such as mining and metalwork that expose them to excess amounts of the mineral, or in areas of the world that have higher levels of molybdenum in the soil. Symptoms include achy joints, gout-like symptoms, and elevated levels of uric acid. [1] However, a toxicity from the diet is highly unusual as the kidneys are very efficient at excreting any excess amount.
Although a handful of studies have associated very high intakes of molybdenum with elevated uric acid levels,copperdeficiency, and infertility, subsequent research has not confirmed these findings, with negative effects seen more commonly in animal research than humans. [2]

üîó Copper
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/copper/

Copper is a naturally occurring metal found in soil, water, and rocks. Nutritionally, it is an essential trace mineral found in some foods and in supplements. It works to assist various enzymes that produce energy for the body, break down and absorb iron, and build red blood cells, collagen, connective tissue, and brain neurotransmitters. Copper also supports normal brain development and immune functions, and is a component of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that dismantles harmful oxygen ‚Äúfree radicals.‚Äù Copper is absorbed in the small intestine and found mainly in bones and muscle tissue.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 900 micrograms daily for men and women. Pregnancy and lactation in adults 19+ years requires 1,300 micrograms daily, with a slightly lower amount of 1,000 micrograms daily in younger ages 14-18 years.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for copper for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 10,000 micrograms daily.
Because dozens of enzymes use copper to perform metabolic processes throughout the body, it is believed that both an excess and deficiency of copper may interrupt these normal processes and a stable level is required for optimal health. The body is typically efficient at stabilizing copper levels (absorption increases if copper intake is low, and vice versa). [1] Abnormal copper levels result from genetic mutations, aging, or environmental influences that may predispose to conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. [2]
Copper can have ‚Äúpro-oxidant‚Äù effects that potentially cause stress and damage to cells. The muscles in the heart contain high concentrations of copper, and may be negatively affected by either a deficiency or toxicity of the mineral. [3] Both conditions have been associated with atherogenesis, the early build-up of plaque in heart arteries. [3,4] Some cohort studies show an association with higher self-reported intakes of copper and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, as well as increased risk ofheart diseasewith a copper deficiency. [3,5] Other cohort studies show an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in people with higher copper blood levels compared with lower levels, although it should be noted that the higher blood levels in these studies remained within a normal range. [4,6] Due to these mixed findings, more research is needed before making conclusions on the cardiovascular effect of copper.
Some research shows that those with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), but both low and high blood levels of copper have been reported in the brains of people with AD. [1] A meta-analysis showed that people with AD had higher serum copper levels than those without AD. [7] However, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not show that copper supplements given for 12 months improved cognition in participants with mild AD. [8] Additionally, observational prospective studies have not found that self-reported dietary and total copper intakes are associated with cognitive decline. [1] More research is needed to better understand if and how high or low levels of copper are associated with AD risk.
Copper may play a role incancerfor several reasons. It supports angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor, and activates enzymes and signaling proteins used by cancer cells. [9,10] An emerging area of research has focused on the role of copper in metastatic cancer cells (these are cells that break away from a primary tumor and spread to other areas in the body). [11] Levels of copper in these aggressive cells were found to be higher than in non-metastatic cancer cells. Intentionally depleting copper levels by blocking its bioavailability may reduce the energy these cells need to travel in the body. Chelation-based treatments that bind to and inactivate copper are being researched. [10]
Copper is found in highest amounts inprotein foodslike organ meats,shellfish,fish,nuts, and seeds as well aswhole grainsandchocolate. The absorption of copper in the body will increase if the diet contains less copper, and decrease if the body has enough copper.
A copper deficiency is rare in the U.S. among healthy people and occurs primarily in people with genetic disorders or malabsorption problems such as Crohn‚Äôs and celiac disease. A genetic condition called Menkes disease interferes with copper absorption, leading to severe deficiency that could become fatal without copper injections. Also, it is possible to create a copper deficiency by taking high doses ofzincsupplements that can block the absorption of copper in the small intestine.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals as the body is efficient at excreting excess copper. It has been seen with Wilson‚Äôs disease, a rare genetic condition, that prevents copper from exiting the body and therefore leading to high blood levels. Severe liver damage and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may occur. Although very rare, it is possible to consume excess copper if continuously storing and then serving boiling liquids from corroding copper or brass vessels.
Although copper is naturally found in water, excessive levels of copper in drinking water is usually caused by leaked copper from old, corroded household pipes and faucets. There is greater risk if water is stagnant from lack of use or using hot tap water (copper more easily dissolves at higher temperatures). In these cases, exposure to excess copper can be decreased by running cold tap water for several minutes before using. It is also advised to use only cold tap water for drinking and cooking, and to avoid drinking hot tap water.

üîó Phosphorus
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/phosphorus/

Phosphorus is a mineral that naturally occurs in many foods and is also available as a supplement. It plays multiple roles in the body. It is a key element of bones, teeth, and cell membranes. It helps to activate enzymes, and keeps blood pH within a normal range. Phosphorus regulates the normal function of nerves and muscles, including the heart, and is also a building block of our genes, as it makes up DNA, RNA, and ATP, the body‚Äôs major source of energy. [1]
The kidneys, bones, and intestines tightly regulate phosphorus levels in the body. If the diet lacks phosphorus or too little phosphorus is absorbed, several things happen to preserve its stores and try to maintain normal levels: the kidneys excrete less phosphorus in urine, the digestive tract becomes more efficient at absorbing phosphorus, and the bones release its stores of phosphorus into the blood. [1] The opposite actions occur in these organs if the body has adequate phosphorus stores.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years is 700 mg a day. Pregnancy and lactation require the same amount of phosphorus at 700 mg daily. [2]
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for phosphorus for adult men and women ages 19-70 years old is 4,000 mg daily, and for older adults 71+ years, 3,000 mg daily. The UL for pregnant and lactating women ages 14-50 years is 3,500 and 4,000 mg, respectively.
Kidneys help to regulate normal levels of phosphorus in the body. If the body has adequate stores of the mineral, the kidneys will push out extra phosphorus in the urine. With chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys cannot perform this action and the amount of phosphorus can rise to harmful levels in the blood. Studies show that adults with CKD have higher phosphate levels than those with normal kidney function. [3] This may quicken the progression of CKD, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, bone disorders, and death. [4,5] It appears that patients with higher phosphate levels and more advanced levels of CKD (such as those on dialysis) have a greater risk of disease progression and death than those with milder forms of CKD. [6-9]
Even so, it is unclear if lowering phosphate levels in those with CKD improves health outcomes later on. Dietary recommendations for phosphorus depend on how much the disease has progressed, and a person‚Äôs blood level of phosphorus. Some recommendations suggest limiting animal protein while increasing plant proteins, and reading food labels to limit foods with phosphate additives. [4] Plant-based proteins like legumes, nuts, and seeds containphytates, which interfere with the absorption of phosphorus in the gut. [10] Medications like phosphate binders are also sometimes prescribed to be taken with food to reduce the amount of phosphorus absorbed in the gut.
Some studies have found that excess phosphorus can promote the calcification, or hardening, of heart arteries and increase inflammation. [11] Higher phosphate levels may be associated with an increased risk ofcardiovascular disease(CVD). A meta-analysis of six cohort studies of more than 120,000 healthy adults followed for up to 29 years showed a 36% increased risk of deaths from CVD and all causes in those with the highest levels of serum phosphorus, compared with the lowest levels. [12] Deaths from all causes were seen mainly in men, not women.
The foods highest in phosphorus are animal proteins, which also tend to be high in other components related to CVD, like saturated fat. So it is not clear if phosphorus alone is associated with an increased risk of CVD, or if high levels are an indicator of another risk factor. The research is also unclear if restricting dietary phosphorus can prevent CVD in otherwise healthy adults. [2]
Elevated phosphorus levels may disrupt the normal hormonal balance of phosphorus,calcium, andvitamin Dthat regulates bone health. Animal studies have shown that high dietary phosphorus intakes are detrimental to bone health. Yet the evidence is less clear in humans, partly because it is difficult to estimate accurate phosphorus intakes. Most studies measure phosphorus in the blood, which may not reflect true dietary intakes of phosphorus, since the majority of the mineral is stored in bones and the body maintains blood levels within a specific range. However, research has shown that a higher intake of phosphate additives, from various foods like cola beverages and salad dressings that are very well-absorbed in the gut, are associated with negative effects on bone metabolism. [13] These include fractures and a lower bone mineral density. [14] More research is needed in this area.
A variety of foods naturally contain phosphorus, and the richest sources are dairy, red meat, poultry, seafood, legumes, and nuts. Phosphorus from these foods is called organic phosphorus. It is absorbed more efficiently from animal foods than plant foods. Plant foods like seeds, legumes, and whole grains contain a storage form of phosphorus calledphytates or phytic acidthat can reduce the mineral‚Äôs absorption. The body lacks an enzyme needed to break down phytic acid, so as it passes through the digestive tract it can bind not only to phosphorus but other minerals likeironandzinc. Cooking, sprouting, and soaking are some food preparation techniques that help to break down phytic acid so that phosphorus is more easily absorbed.
Inorganic phosphorus is a processed form added to foods to preserve color, moisture, and texture. It is found in fast foods, deli meats, canned and bottled beverages, and many other processed foods. Phosphate additives and preservatives are a significant contributor to phosphorus intakes, comprising up to 30% in the U.S. diet. [4] Inorganic phosphorus is very easily absorbed in the gut: about 90%, compared with 40-60% from natural animal and plant foods. [15] Phosphorus is also available in supplement form.
A phosphorus deficiency is called hypophosphatemia, defined by blood levels that fall below the normal range. However, blood levels of phosphate do not necessarily show the total amount of phosphorus in the body, as most of it is stored in bones and teeth. The most common causes of deficiency are kidney problems or a condition called hyperparathyroidism, in which too much parathyroid hormone is released that causes phosphorus to exit the body through urine. Also, the overuse of aluminum-containing antacids can bind to phosphorus and increase the risk of a deficiency.
A notable but less common occurrence of hypophosphatemia occurs with refeeding syndrome, seen in people with severe malnutrition. Patients who are malnourished from conditions like cancer, advanced liver disease, alcohol abuse, or anorexia nervosa may be started on supplemental nutrition feedings through a tube or vein. However because their starved state has reduced their ability to efficiently process food, reintroducing nutrition can cause problems. A sudden infusion of nutrients and calories causes an insulin surge, which results in rapid shifts in electrolytes and fluids in the blood. Blood levels of electrolyte nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium may quickly drop. If untreated, refeeding syndrome can lead to respiratory failure, coma, cardiac arrest, and even death. The situation can be avoided by giving these electrolytes intravenously to the patient prior to the nutritional feedings.
Symptoms appearing with a phosphorus deficiency:
A toxicity from phosphorus, called hyperphosphatemia, is rare because the body will regulate any excess levels in healthy individuals. It might occur with supplement use, but generally the use of phosphorus supplements is not common and the amount of phosphorus in them is typically not high. (2) People with hyperphosphatemia may show no symptoms; others may develop calcium deposits and hardening of soft tissues in the body, such as in the kidney, resulting from a disruption in the normal metabolism of calcium.

üîó Understanding Food Labels
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-label-guide/

The information on food labels is intended to help consumers become savvy about their food choices. The front, back, and sides of a package are filled with information to inform us what the food contains and to provide guidance in making healthier selections of processed foods. However, all the numbers, percentages, and sometimes complex-sounding ingredients can lead to more confusion than clarity.
This guide will help you to navigate the terminology and nutrition information on a food package to ensure that you know what you‚Äôre buying.
The Nutrition Facts label is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was first mandated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 to help consumers make quick, informed food choices. It has undergone revisions, with thelatest update released in 2016. Changes are generally based on updated scientific information and input from the public regarding ease of use.
The percent Daily Value (%DV) shows how much of a nutrient in one serving of food contributes to one‚Äôs approximate daily requirement for the nutrient. To best use the %DV, remember these simple guidelines:
For more commentary on the updated Nutrition Facts label by Harvard nutrition experts, see the article,Updated Nutrition Facts Panel makes significant progress with ‚Äúadded sugars,‚Äù but there is room for improvement.
This is the section of a food label consumers see first, which within seconds can influence their purchase. This has made it a battleground between public health advocates and food manufacturers. Food manufacturers can choose to display FOP symbols or graphics that highlight nutritional aspects of the product if they are favorable to health, such as being lower in calories or added sugar, but may leave out less favorable information such as being high in sodium or saturated fat. These graphics promote a perception of healthfulness, which can be misleading if consumers rely only on these images without reading the Nutrition Facts panel for complete information. The FDA does not closely monitor these FOP graphics. Because research has shown that ‚Äúpositive‚Äù FOP labels like health stamps or checkmarks can overrate a food‚Äôs healthfulness, public health advocates have supported initiatives for FOP ‚Äúwarning‚Äù labels (e.g., traffic lights or stop signs) to highlight nutrients that are harmful to health in excess, such as sugars and fats insweetened beveragesandultra-processed snacks. All FOP labels in the U.S. are voluntary, which allows food manufacturers to highlight or hide the nutrition information they choose to help promote or preserve sales. If warning labels became mandatory, as public health advocates propose, the pressure on manufacturers would increase to change certain products to improve their nutritional quality.
These are statements reviewed by the FDA and supported by scientific evidence that suggest certain foods or diets may lower the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 regulates these health claims, which must undergo review by the FDA through a petition process. The FDA has approved12 health claimson food labels such as the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and hypertension; fiber-containing grains, fruits and vegetables and cancer; and folic acid and neural tube defects. However, just because a food contains a specific nutrient that is associated with a decreased risk of disease does not necessarily make the food healthy as a whole. An example would be a breakfast cereal high in soluble fiber for heart health but that is also high in added sugars. Research finds that consumers believe that a food carrying a health claim is healthier than a product that does not.
These statements describe the nutrients in a food beyond what is listed on the Nutrition Facts label, intended to showcase a health benefit of the food. An example is ‚ÄúContains 100% Vitamin C.‚Äù Most terms like ‚Äúlow sodium,‚Äù ‚Äúhigh fiber,‚Äù ‚Äúreduced fat,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood source of‚Äù are regulated by the FDA, and the nutrient amounts must meetspecific guidelinesto make these claims. Also regulated are comparative terms like ‚Äúless sugar‚Äù or ‚Äúfewer calories‚Äù comparing two similar products. However, these statements can mislead consumers about their overall healthfulness. For example, a bag of potato chips may advertise that it has 40% less fat and is cholesterol-free, suggesting it is a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food, when in reality even a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù potato chip is still a high-calorie ultra-processed food offering little nutrition. Some terms are not yet regulated by the FDA such as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or ‚Äúmultigrain.‚Äù As another example, see the pros and cons of health labeling forWhole Grains.
Chile implemented the Law of Food Labeling and Advertising in 2016, comprised of mandatory front-of-package (FOP) warning labels, restrictions on child-directed marketing, and the banning of sales in schools of all foods and beverages containing added sugars, sodium, or saturated fats that exceeded set nutrient or calorie thresholds. [1] The FOP labels displayed a black stop sign that used warning words of ‚Äúhigh in‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories. Later analyses found that purchases of sweetened beverages significantly declined following the implementation of this multifaceted law that was more effective than prior single initiatives (i.e., sweetened beverages tax).
Opposition by food industries in other countries is strong toward warning labels such as these. [2] In the United States, in 2011 the FDA recommended a FOP graphic of stars or checkmarks that indicated a less healthful versus healthful food choice. [3] In response, the Grocery Manufacturers Association intercepted this project by introducing the FOP label ‚ÄúFacts Up Front,‚Äù which displays certain nutrient amounts of a processed food. There was criticism due to its voluntary nature so that manufacturers of less healthful foods could simply choose not to display it. Opposers also noted that simply listing the nutrient amounts would not necessarily help a consumer to know if it was a healthful choice if they were unsure what the amounts meant (as opposed to the FDA‚Äôs stars and checks system that provided straightforward guidance on a healthful versus less healthful choice). Regardless, soon after initiation of the Facts Up Front label, the FDA discontinued their labeling project while continuing to monitor the Facts Up Front system.
The FDA oversees the ingredients listed on food labels. A packaged food must list the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. In other words, the ingredients that weigh the most are listed first. The list may contain unfamiliar terms alongside the common ingredient names. These may be added preservatives or colors (e.g., sodium bisulfite, caramel color), thickeners or emulsifiers (e.g., guar gum, carrageenan), or the scientific names of vitamins and minerals (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol). Ingredients like added sugars may carry many alternative names but are essentially varying combinations of fructose and glucose: evaporated cane juice, high fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and turbinado sugar.
Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, eight major food allergens‚Äîmilk, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, wheat, eggs, and soybeans‚Äîare required to be listed in a ‚Äúcontains‚Äù statement near the Ingredients list if present in a food. An example would be ‚Äúcontains wheat, milk, and soy.‚Äù Advisory statements addressing cross-contamination may also be listed such as ‚Äúmay contain wheat‚Äù or ‚Äúproduced in a facility that also uses peanuts.‚Äù On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act became law, declaring sesame as the 9th major food allergen recognized in the US. Sesame will be a required allergen listing as of January 1, 2023.
Other potential allergens include gluten and color additives such as FD&C Yellow No. 5. The FDA mandates that a product containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 must identify it on the food label. The term ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù can be listed on a label if it meets a specific maximum amount of gluten as defined by the FDA.
These dates found on food products inform both the seller and consumer about the shelf-life and optimal quality of the product. They are determined by the food manufacturer‚Äôs judgment for peak quality. Foods can still be eaten safely after these dates, with the exact amount of time dependent on the food product, but the flavor and texture may begin to deteriorate. These expiration dates are not required by federal law though some states may institute their own requirements.

üîó Tips for a Healthy Summer Picnic
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-summer-picnic-tips/

As summer brings warm days and later evenings, many of us head outdoors for good fun and food. Whether you‚Äôre hosting a backyard cookout, or planning a picnic on the go, be sure to fuel your family with summertime meals that are both nutritious and safe.
If you plan to bring food that will remain outdoors for several hours, choose foods that won‚Äôt wilt, melt, or spoil easily in the heat. Good choices are fresh firm vegetables (raw or cooked), chopped fruit, whole grains, pasta salad, beans, and trail mix! Here are some additional ideas to inspire your picnic basket or cookout spread:
Check out these other picnic-friendly (and portable!) ideas:
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS
WHOLE GRAINS AND BEANS
DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO HYDRATE!
Hot dogs, hamburgers, and sausages are popular choices for grill food but rank low in healthfulness. They are linked with anincreased riskof colorectal and stomach cancers, diabetes, and heart disease. Along with high amounts of sodium, processed meat contains added nitrates and heme iron (a type of iron found only in animal foods) and are usually cooked with very high heat, all of which can produce cancer-causing compounds called heterocyclic amines (HCAs). During grilling, the fat from rich cuts of meat tends to drip into the flames, producing more smoke and carcinogens called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To reduce your exposure to these elements:
Video:Dr. Guy Crosbygrills somemiso marinated salmon, and shares his tips for a healthy cookout.
Cases of foodborne illness tend to spike in the summer. There are several reasons. One is that harmful bacteria thrive in warm humid temperatures. The danger zone is between 40-140¬∞F when bacteria can double in number in about 20 minutes, and even faster between 90-100¬∞F. Another potential safety hazard is preparing and serving meals outdoors with unwashed hands or on contaminated surfaces. Bring sanitizer to use before and after eating, after using a restroom, after handling pets, and after changing diapers.
Although common fare at picnics, reconsider bringing the highly perishable foods listed below. If you can prevent food from spoiling in warm weather, there is less food to throw out and less waste. If you must bring perishable items, surround them with ice packs and store in a shady spot. According to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, discard perishable foods that have been left at room temperature for more than two hours (one hour if the temperature is higher than 90¬∞F).
Don‚Äôt be shy in seasoning your food with herbs and spices. Not only do they infuse diverse flavors into your dish and offer beneficial plant chemicals called polyphenols (these are also abundant in some fruits, vegetables, and teas), but research has demonstrated the antimicrobial properties of certain herbs and spices. Garlic, onion, oregano, thyme, cinnamon, tarragon, rosemary, and cloves have been shown to prevent the growth of and even kill some bacteria including strains ofE. coli,salmonella, andstreptococcus. However, the exact amount of herbs and spices needed in food to produce an antibacterial effect as well as its form (as extracts, essential oils, dried vs. fresh, etc.) is conflicting, so do not rely on herbs and spices alone for food safety!
An overflowing trash bin is a common site at cookouts and picnics. Instead of bringing disposable paperware and utensils, soda cans, and single-use water bottles, use products made of glass, bamboo, cloth, wood, ceramic, or stainless steel that can be washed and reused. Consider these tips to reduce waste:

üîó Selenium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/selenium/

Selenium is a trace mineral, which means that the body only needs a small amount of it. It is found naturally in foods or as a supplement. Selenium is an essential component of various enzymes and proteins, called selenoproteins, that help to make DNA and protect against cell damage and infections; these proteins are also involved in reproduction and the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Most selenium in the body is stored in muscle tissue, although the thyroid gland holds the highest concentration of selenium due to various selenoproteins that assist with thyroid function.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years of age is 55 micrograms daily. Women who are pregnant and lactating need about 60 and 70 micrograms daily, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for selenium for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 400 micrograms daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Selenium is a component of selenoproteins and enzymes. These have antioxidant properties that help to break down peroxides, which can damage tissues and DNA, leading to inflammation and other health problems.
A Cochrane review of 13 prospective observational studies showed a 31% reduced risk of cancer and 45% reduced risk of deaths from cancer in the groups with the highest selenium intakes or blood levels compared with the lowest selenium levels, particularly in men. [1] Yet, the authors cautioned about weaknesses in the meta-analysis since there were differences among the study populations and possible inaccuracy when assessing dietary selenium (regional differences in the selenium content of food was not accounted for).
Another Cochrane review of 83 randomized placebo-controlled trials did not find that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer type. In addition, some of the trials noted a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes with long-term use of selenium supplements (about 7 years) who had normal selenium blood levels at the start the of study. Further research is needed to replicate this finding. [2]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and cancer before making specific dietary recommendations.
There are high concentrations of selenium in the thyroid gland, where there are several selenium-containing enzymes regulating thyroid function. If the body does not have enough selenium, it can lead to autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto‚Äôs disease and Graves‚Äô disease. Both of these conditions cause the body to create antibodies that attack the thyroid gland, leading to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
Randomized controlled trials studying selenium supplementation show mixed results. Supplements have not been shown to significantly affect thyroid function in people with normal thyroid or mild hypothyroidism, despite causing increased blood levels of selenium. [3,4] Other studies have shown selenium to decrease the amount of these antibodies and promote the activity of selenoproteins, which work to decrease inflammation. [5]
The role of selenium supplementations for people with autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is still unclear. ¬†A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine controlled trials did not find that selenium supplements changed thyroid hormone function in people with ATD, nor did a Cochrane review. [6]
Selenoproteins help to protect cell membranes from damage by free radicals and keep blood platelets from becoming sticky, both of which can lead to heart disease. However, both cohort studies and clinical trials have shown mixed results regarding the relationship of selenium andcardiovascular disease (CVD).
Observational studies have shown that people with both low and high selenium exposure (based on dietary intake and blood levels) have an increased risk of CVD. Others have found no association at all. [7] Clinical trials have not found that selenium supplements reduce the risk of CVD or cardiac death; however these trials were small and included people who were not likely selenium deficient at the start of the study. [7]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and CVD before making specific dietary recommendations.
The amount of selenium in foods can vary widely depending on the selenium content of the soil in which it is grown. Soil content varies widely by region. Plant foods obtain selenium from soil, which will then affect the amount of selenium in animals eating those plants.Protein foodsfrom animals are generally good sources of selenium. Seafood, organ meats, and Brazil nuts are the foods highest in selenium although Americans obtain most of their selenium from everyday staples, like breads, cereals, poultry, red meat, andeggs.
A deficiency of selenium in the U.S. is rare as the soil throughout North America is generally rich in selenium. [7] Even if people live in areas with lower-selenium soil, the transport of food across the region as well as the use of fortified foods and supplements reduce the risk of deficiency.
Two conditions are associated with severe selenium deficiency: 1) Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy, or disease of heart muscle, and 2) Kashin-Beck disease, a form of osteoarthritis.
Symptoms:
Groups at risk for deficiency:
Chronically high intakes of selenium can lead to health problems, ranging from muscle tremors, hair loss, stomach upset, and lightheadedness, to more severe outcomes of heart attack, respiratory distress, or kidney failure. Brazil nuts are exceptionally high in selenium even when grown in low-selenium soil, with even one nut containing more than the RDA. Eating too many of these nuts on a daily basis can reach a toxic level, as well as using supplements that contain selenium in excess of the RDA.

üîó Mushrooms
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/mushrooms/

An often under-appreciated food, mushrooms have been eaten and used as medicine for thousands of years. Traditional and folk medicine practitioners laud the bell-shaped fungi for their healing and cleansing properties. All varieties of mushrooms are low in calories and fat, and contain modest amounts of fiber and various nutrients. Perhaps the more interesting properties of mushrooms are their non-nutritive plant substances‚Äîpolysaccharides, indoles, polyphenols, and carotenoids in which cell and animal studies have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. [1] Mushrooms are also recognized by chefs for their ability to create savory rich flavors called umami, thanks to the presence of an amino acid called glutamate, which is also found in meats, fish, cheeses, and simmering soups.
Although considered a vegetable, mushrooms are neither a plant nor animal food. They are a type of fungus that contains a substance called ergosterol, similar in structure to cholesterol in animals. Ergosterol can be transformed into vitamin D with exposure to ultraviolet light. Mushrooms vary in appearance with more than 10,000 known types, but generally they are distinguished by a stem, fleshy rounded cap, and gills underneath the cap. China and the U.S. are among the top five producers of mushrooms worldwide.
The amount of vitamin D mushrooms contain varies widely and depends on how long the mushrooms are exposed to UV light. Estimates show that fresh wild mushrooms like chanterelles and morels can contain up to 1200 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving, whereas mushrooms grown in darkened conditions like white button, shiitake, and oyster contain less than 40 IU. [3] However, button mushrooms that are exposed to sunlight can produce up to 400 IU vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving though the exact amount depends on factors related to their UV exposure such as the time of day, season, latitude, and duration. Mushrooms treated with UV lamps can produce even higher amounts of vitamin D. Even after harvesting, mushrooms can continue to produce vitamin D, whether exposed to UV light from the sun or a lamp.
Dried mushrooms also contain the vitamin. Some estimates show dried mushrooms to contain about 600 IU of vitamin D2 per 3.5 ounces if stored in dark, cool, dry conditions for up to 6 months (the vitamin may start to break down after that time). [3]
Humidity and cooking mushrooms in water do not appear to affect vitamin D content in mushrooms, but cooking them in fat (such as oils) can cause the vitamin to leach out because it is fat-soluble.
Edible mushrooms like maitake and shiitake have also been used as medicine throughout history. Other mushrooms that are too tough to eat have been used solely for medicinal purposes such as reishi. Plant chemicals and components in mushrooms may exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects, but the exact mechanism is still unclear and an area of active research. [4] Animal and cell studies show that mushrooms can stimulate the activity of immune cells, macrophages, and free radicals that can stop the growth and spread of tumor cells and cause existing tumor cells to die. [5] Various polysaccharides in mushrooms including beta-glucans are believed to exert these cancer-fighting properties. [4,6]
Two epidemiological studies found that higher mushroom intake had protective effects on the brain in older adults. [7, 8] Components in mushrooms may prevent the growth of amyloid proteins related to dementia, and act as antioxidants, specifically an amino acid called ergothioneine. A 2019 cross-sectional study of 663 Chinese men and women 60 years of age and older found that those who ate more than 2 servings of mushrooms per week (1 serving = 3/4 cup cooked) compared with those who ate less than 1 serving per week had a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). [9] After adjusting for potential confounders (factors linked with cognitive decline) such as body mass index, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and dietary intake of meat, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, the group with the higher intake of mushrooms had a 52% lower risk of developing MCI than the low intake group. This cross-sectional study only provided a snapshot of the prevalence of MCI in the participants at one point in time; the authors noted that a direct effect of mushrooms on cognition could not be made by this study. For example, it is possible that people who developed MCI had changed their diet that included less mushrooms. Epidemiological studies following people over time, measuring biomarkers for ergothioneine and other mushrooms substances, and randomized clinical trials that administer ergothioneine or other mushroom phytonutrients will help to shed light on its potential effect on cognition.
Mushrooms contain polysaccharides that act as aprebiotic, or food for beneficial gut bacteria. Studies show that these polysaccharides stimulate the growth and survival of beneficial strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. They remain undigested and therefore can reach the colon where these bacteria live. [10, 11]
In two large prospective cohort studies, mushroom consumption was not significantly associated with risk oftype 2 diabetes,cardiovascular disease, [12] or cancer. [13]¬† However, low levels of mushroom consumption in the populations may have limited the ability of these studies to detect significant associations. In addition, mushroom consumption was measured once at baseline and consumption patterns may have changed over time. Moreover, different types of mushrooms were not assessed in the Food Frequency Questionnaires.
There are thousands of varieties of mushrooms, with different colors, shapes, and sizes. Because some wild mushrooms can cause stomach upset or allergic reactions, or may even be poisonous, your safest bet is to stick to supermarket varieties and avoid picking and eating raw wild mushrooms on your own.
The common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is the most common in the U.S. It is the mildest-tasting mushroom and can be eaten raw or cooked.
Other types of mushrooms available for sale include:
Chanterelle:the cap is a wavy golden trumpet-like shapeCremini (baby bella):a young Portobello mushroom that is dark and firmEnoki:long, thin white stems with small white caps that are eaten raw or cookedMaitake:a head that resembles flowering leavesMorel:the cap is a spongy dimpled oblong shapeOyster:a fan-shaped delicate capPorcini:a reddish-brown rounded cap with a thick cylindrical stemPortobello:a large brown thick cap with rich juicy flavor that work well as a meat substituteShiitake:a dark brown umbrella cap with a thin cream-colored stem
Mushrooms that have been specially treated with UV light may carry a label on the front of the package that says ‚ÄúUV-treated‚Äù or ‚Äúrich in vitamin D,‚Äù or display the exact amount of vitamin D they contain.
Select mushrooms with firm whole caps with an even texture. They should be refrigerated until use, but ideally within one week. Do not wash or clean them until just before using. Storing in a brown paper bag with the top open will help to absorb moisture and keep them from spoiling, as opposed to tight plastic wrapping that traps moisture. Because they are about 80-90% water, mushrooms do not freeze well, becoming mushy when defrosted.
Mushrooms are delicate and should be cleaned gently. Either place them under gentle running water to release any dirt or brush dirt off with a dampened paper towel.
Cooking mushrooms in high-temperature water such as boiling and microwaving may cause its water-soluble nutrients (B vitamins, potassium) to escape in the cooking water. Saut√©ing quickly over high heat, or simmering over low heat, such as in soups, are ideal cooking methods for preserving nutrients.
More recipe ideas and serving suggestions featuring mushrooms:
Not all mushrooms are edible. Wild mushrooms with white gills or a ring around the stem are considered poisonous. Some other inedible mushrooms look like edible mushrooms, so unless one is trained in recognizing wild mushrooms, it‚Äôs best to find your mushrooms at the market!

üîó Processed Foods and Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/processed-foods/

Processed foods are generally thought to be inferior to unprocessed foods. The term may suggest that a packaged food item contains many ingredients, perhaps even artificial colors, flavors, or other chemical additives. Often referred to as convenience or pre-prepared foods, processed foods are suggested to contribute to the obesity epidemic and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. However, the definition of processed food varies widely depending on the source:
According to these standards, virtually all foods sold in the supermarket would be classified as ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù to some degree. Because food begins to deteriorate and loses nutrients as soon as it is harvested, even theapplesin the produce aisle undergo four or more processing steps before being sold to the consumer. That‚Äôs why in practice, it‚Äôs helpful to differentiate between the various degrees of food processing.
A popular system to classify processed foods was introduced in 2009, called the NOVA classification. It lists four categories considering the degree to which a food is processed and the purpose of these modifications: [2-4]
The NOVA system is recognized by the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization, but not currently in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration or USDA. NOVA has been criticized for being too general in classifying certain foods, causing confusion. For example, yogurt may fall into more than one category: plain yogurt is minimally processed, but fruited yogurt with added sweeteners could be labeled either processed or ultra-processed depending on how much sweetener and other chemical additives are incorporated. NOVA also does not provide comprehensive lists of specific foods in each category, so the consumer is left to guess where each may fall.
There‚Äôs no doubt that at least some processed foods are found in most people‚Äôs kitchens. There are benefits and drawbacks.
Depending on the degree of processing, nutrients can be destroyed or removed. Peeling outer layers of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may remove plant nutrients (phytochemicals) and fiber. Heating or drying foods can destroy certain vitamins and minerals. Although food manufacturers can add back some of the nutrients lost, it is impossible to recreate the food in its original form.
Currently, bread and frozen meals are some of the most consumed ultra-processed foods in the U.S. [5] While these products can be good sources of whole grains, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, they can also be high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. Given the variety of ultra-processed foods, it may be helpful to distinguish those with lower nutritional value from the broader category. Such distinction can be determined by evaluating a food‚Äôs nutritional content and long-term health effects. A product with an unevenly high ratio of calories to fiber and healthy nutrients (e.g., unsaturated fats, B vitamins, potassium) may be considered an ‚Äúultra-processed food of low nutritional value.‚Äù For example, soda provides high calories from added sugars and no healthy nutrients; and research supports an association between a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. On the other hand, whole-grain bread and fiber-containing low-sugar breakfast cereals that may be fortified with nutrients such as folic acid have consistently been linked with lower rates of stroke. [6]
To help illustrate the spectrum of food processing, the table below includes ultra-processed foods of low nutritional value as its own category. We also we separate the NOVA categories of ‚Äúunprocessed‚Äù and ‚Äúminimally processed‚Äù foods, and omit NOVA‚Äôs ‚Äúprocessed culinary ingredients‚Äù category, which mainly includes supplementary food components to assist in cooking and food preparation.
store-bought hummus made with chickpeas, spices, and oil without preservatives
Ingredients used widely in the production of ultra-processed foods such assaturated fats,added sugar, andsodiumhave become markers of poor diet quality due to their effect on heart disease, obesity, and high blood pressure. [8,9] It is estimated that ultra-processed foods contribute about 90% of the total calories obtained from added sugars. [5]
Food processing is a very broad spectrum that ranges from basic technologies like freezing or milling, to the incorporation of additives that promote shelf stability or increase palatability. As a general rule, emphasizing unprocessed or minimally processed foods in the daily diet is optimal. That said, the use of processed and even ultra-processed foods is the choice of the consumer, and there are pros and cons that come with each type. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a more processed food in one‚Äôs diet. There is evidence showing an association with certain types of food processing and poor health outcomes, especially low-nutrient ultra-processed foods that containadded sugars,excess sodium, andunhealthful fats. But there also exist ultra-processed foods that have low amounts of these ingredients while being fortified in beneficial nutrients such as calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins B and D.
Research is still clarifying if any harmful health effects from ultra-processed foods arise from the higher degree of processing or simply from the poorer nutritional quality often accompanying these types of foods. There is a growing range of processed and ultra-processed foods available, and some products may be a useful addition to a healthful diet.
You don‚Äôt have to avoid all processed foods but begin by adding more fresh or minimally processed ingredients to your shopping cart. More time may be needed to prepare these foods than just opening a can or popping a frozen container in a microwave, but the rewards may be fresher flavors, increased nutrients, and eating less additives that have no nutritional benefit.

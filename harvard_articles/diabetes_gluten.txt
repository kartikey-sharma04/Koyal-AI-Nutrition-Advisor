üîó Diet Review: Gluten-Free for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/gluten-free-diet-weight-loss/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans? In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
A gluten-free diet is not new. It is the sole treatment for 1-2% of Americans who have celiac disease, a serious condition where the body attacks a protein calledgluten, naturally found in many whole grains, causing a spectrum of symptoms that range frombloating to intestinal damage. Up to 6% of people have a related stomach-upsetting but less threatening condition called non-celiac gluten sensitivity. With such a small number truly needing this diet, why have sales of gluten-free products topped $12 billion according to market research?
What is new‚Äîand driving these sales upward‚Äîis the use of a gluten-free diet for weight loss, partly fueled by celebrity endorsements and personal testimonies of not only pounds quickly shed, but increased energy, improved digestion, and even clearer skin. Consumer surveys reveal that people perceive gluten-free products to be healthier than their gluten-containing counterparts, and almost a third of Americans are now avoiding or reducing their intake of gluten. [1]
A gluten-free diet eliminates all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. Gluten is largely ubiquitous in foods, found as a main ingredient (in wheat, rye, barley, triticale, cross-contaminated oats), in sauces (soy sauce, malt vinegar, flour), and as additives or fillers (maltodextrin, wheat starch). SeeWhat Is a Gluten-Free Diet?
When first going gluten-free, perhaps the most noticeable change is having to relinquish favorite staples of bread, pasta, cereals, and processed snack foods. Because some of these products, which are typically highly processed, may be low in nutrients and high in calories, one may feel better and even lose some weight soon after removing them from the diet. Although there are now plenty of gluten-free counterparts to take their place, a gluten-free diet usually causes one to revisit naturally gluten-free whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains like brown rice, quinoa, and millet. Including these minimally processed, high-fiber foods may also help to promote weight loss and a feeling of well-being.
Though research has explored the effects of a gluten-free diet on gastrointestinal disorders, autism, and fibromyalgia, there is none that examines the diet‚Äôs effects on weight loss alone or for general health benefits. Because of the lack of experimental studies on weight loss, some researchers have instead examined the long-term effects of people with celiac disease on gluten-free diets, or who are generally healthy and consume a diet low in wheat and other gluten-containing grains. They have found that gluten-free diets: 1) may promote certain nutrient deficiencies, 2) may increase the risk of some chronic diseases, and 3) may actually cause weight gain.
Gluten-free foods wear a health halo, a belief that a food product is healthful even when it may not offer special health benefits for most people. Research has shown that if one aspect of a food is advertised as healthy or people believe it to be healthy (in this case, the term ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù), there is a tendency to eat more of it. [14] This may promote weight gain. Also, an overreliance on processed gluten-free products may lead to a decreased intake of certain nutrients like fiber and B vitamins that are protective against chronic diseases.
Although a gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease and may help to alleviate symptoms in various conditions related to gluten sensitivity, there is currently no evidence showing that a gluten-free diet is effective for weight loss or for general health benefits.¬† For individuals who don‚Äôt have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, there is no need to restrict gluten consumption. A healthy dietary pattern typically includes higher amounts of whole grains and lower amounts of refined grains and added sugar.

================================================================================

üîó Gluten: A Benefit or Harm to the Body?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/gluten/

The quick answer is that it can be either, but it all depends on the individual.
Gluten is a protein naturally found in somegrainsincluding wheat, barley, and rye. It acts like a binder, holding food together and adding a ‚Äústretchy‚Äù quality‚Äîthink of a pizza maker tossing and stretching out a ball of dough. Without gluten, the dough would rip easily.
Other grains that contain gluten are wheat berries, spelt, durum, emmer, semolina, farina, farro, graham, khorasan wheat, einkorn, and triticale (a blend of wheat and rye). Oats‚Äîthough naturally gluten free‚Äîoften contain gluten from cross-contamination when they are grown near, or ¬†processed in the same facilities as the grains listed above. Gluten is also sold as wheat gluten, or seitan, a popular vegan high-protein food. Less obvious sources of gluten include soy sauce and modified food starch, however gluten-free options of these products are available and labeled as such to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs gluten-free labeling rule.
Gluten is most often associated with wheat and wheat-containing foods that are abundant in our food supply. Negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet. There is little published research to support these claims; in fact published research suggests the opposite.
In a 2017 study of over 100,000 participants without celiac disease, researchers found no association between long-term dietary gluten consumption and heart disease risk. [1]¬†In fact, the findings also suggested that non-celiac individuals who avoid gluten may increase their risk of heart disease, due to the potential for reduced consumption of whole grains.
Gluten may also act as a prebiotic, feeding the ‚Äúgood‚Äù bacteria in our bodies. Arabinoxylan oligosaccharide is a prebiotic carbohydrate derived from wheat bran that has been shown to stimulate the activity of bifidobacteria in the colon. These bacteria are normally found in a healthy human gut. Changes in their amount or activity have been associated with gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. [6,7]
What‚Äôs not great about gluten is that it can cause serious side effects in certain individuals. Some people react differently to gluten, where the body senses it as a toxin, causing one‚Äôs immune cells to overreact and attack it. If an unknowingly sensitive person continues to eat gluten, this creates a kind of battle ground resulting in inflammation. The side effects can range from mild (fatigue, bloating, alternating constipation and diarrhea) to severe (unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, intestinal damage) as seen in the autoimmune disorderceliac disease. Estimates suggest that 1 in 133 Americans has celiac disease, or about 1% of the population, but about 83% of them are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with other conditions. [8,9] Research shows that people with celiac disease also have a slightly higher risk of osteoporosis and anemia (due to malabsorption of calcium and iron, respectively); infertility; nerve disorders; and in rare cases cancer. [10] The good news is that removing gluten from the diet may¬†reverse the damage. A gluten-free diet is the primary medical treatment for celiac disease. However, understanding and following a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging, possibly requiring the guidance of a registered dietitian to learn which foods contain gluten and to ensure that adequate nutrients are obtained from gluten-free alternatives. Other conditions that may require the reduction or elimination of gluten in the diet include:
It is important to note that gluten is a problem only for those who react negatively to it, or test positive for celiac disease. Most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives, without any adverse side effects.
But does this side effect occur in people without a true gluten intolerance, and can the reverse be suggested in that the avoidance of gluten might sharpen the mind? A large cohort study disagrees. Almost 13,500 middle-aged women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study II without celiac disease were followed for 28 years to observe any potential links between gluten intake and mental ability. [15]No significant differences were found in cognitive scores (measuring reaction time, attention, memory, etc.) comparing women with the highest and lowest gluten intakes. The lack of association remained even after excluding women with a dementia or cancer diagnosis.
Unless a person has diagnosed celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or a gluten sensitivity, current evidence does not support that eating gluten increases inflammation in the brain or negatively affects brain health.
This is essentially adiet that removes all foods containing or contaminated with gluten. However, since gluten-containing whole grains contain fiber and nutrients includingB vitamins,magnesium, andiron, it‚Äôs important to make up for these missing nutrients. Along with consuming naturally gluten-free foods in their whole form likefruits,vegetables, legumes,nuts, seeds, fish,eggs, and poultry, the following whole grains are also inherently¬†gluten-free:
It‚Äôs also key not to rely on processed gluten-free foods that may be high in calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium and low in nutrients, such as gluten-free cookies, chips, and other snack foods. Often, these foods are made with processed unfortified rice, tapioca, corn, or potato flours.
The gluten-free food industry has grown 136% from 2013 to 2015 with almost $12 billion in sales in 2015. Interestingly, studies show that people who do not have celiac disease are the biggest purchasers of gluten-free products. [11] Consumer surveys show that the top three reasons people select gluten-free foods are for ‚Äúno reason,‚Äù because they are a ‚Äúhealthier option,‚Äù and for ‚Äúdigestive health.‚Äù [12] For those who are not gluten-intolerant, there is no data to show a specific benefit in following a gluten-free diet, particularly if processed gluten-free products become the mainstay of the diet. In fact, research following patients with celiac disease who change to a gluten-free diet shows an increased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This could be partly due to improved intestinal absorption, but speculation has also focused on the low nutritional quality of processed gluten-free foods that may contain refined sugars and saturated fats and have a higher glycemic index. [13,14]

üîó Diet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that ‚Äúinflammation‚Äù is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by ourimmune system. When a foreign invader enters the body such as bacteria, viruses, or allergens, or an injury occurs, our immune cells act quickly. We may sneeze or cough to rid the body of an offending agent. We may feel pain and swelling at the site of a cut or injury to signal us to be gentle with this delicate area. Blood flows in rapidly, which may produce warmth or redness. These are signs that our immune system is repairing damaged tissue or fighting invaders. As healing takes place, inflammation gradually subsides.
Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state. Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body‚Äôs immune system to constantly attack cells. This sometimes occurs with autoimmune disorders like lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn‚Äôs disease. Sometimes an unhealthy lifestyle from lack of exercise, high stress, and calorie-rich diets can trigger chronic low levels of inflammation throughout the entire body, termed metaflammation. [1,2] This type of low-grade inflammation does not usually produce noticeable symptoms, but over time metaflammation can pave the pathway for chronic conditions likecardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and certaincancers(e.g., breast, colon).
Anti-inflammatory diets may be promoted for these inflammatory conditions. They include several foods that are believed to interfere with the inflammatory process, though research on its exact mechanism is not conclusive. There is no single anti-inflammatory diet plan. Generally it emphasizes eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, minimally refined whole grains, tea, coffee, herbs, spices, and oily fish. TheMediterranean dietandDASH dietare popular dietary plans that already showcase many anti-inflammatory foods.
An anti-inflammatory diet plan not only highlights specific foods and food groups but limits other foods that may contribute to metaflammation such as fatty cuts ofred meat,refined sugary foodsandbeverages, and excessalcohol.
An anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes. It suggests a variety of anti-inflammatory foods to eat daily, rather than focusing on eating one or two specific foods or nutrients. This ensures a greater variety of protective food components, some of which may work synergistically toboost immunity. These foods provide plant chemicals (phytochemicals), antioxidants, and fiber that prevent cellular stresses, inhibit inflammatory signals caused by the immune system, promote healthygut microbiota, and slow down digestion to prevent surges in blood glucose. [3] They may also favorably affect the composition of fat cells to further reduce inflammation.
Other factors aside from diet may help to control inflammation, such asexercising regularly,controlling stress, andgetting enough sleep.
Most available research focuses on foods and dietary patterns that are associated with metaflammation, which in turn helps to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Metaflammation is especially associated with Western-type dietary patterns high in processed meats, saturated fat, refined sugars, salt, and white flour while being low in fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals. [1,4] These diets also tend to be calorie-dense with a high glycemic load, potentially leading toblood sugar surges, insulin resistance, and excess weight gain. Studies have shown that Western diets are associated with increased blood markers of inflammation, though the connection may be due to a string of events rather than one direct action. [1] For example, exposure to air pollution and chronic mental stress can lead to an excess of free radicals produced in the body, which then oxidize and damage other molecules. Atherosclerosis is one condition in which these free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol particles. The actions of both oxidized LDL cholesterol and several types of immune cells form lesions and plaque in the heart arteries that can lead to ischemicheart disease(a type of heart disease caused by narrowed or partially blocked arteries). [5] A long-term diet that is high in saturated fat andcholesterolmay raise LDL levels, increasing the risk of free radical action that may promote this immune response, which partially contributes to a chronic low-level proinflammatory state.
A major cause of low-level inflammation is the build-up of fatty acids in fat tissue (and other tissues) promoted by a high-fat or high-sugar diet. This may cause fat tissue to send signals to immune cells that produce inflammation in various areas, including organs like the pancreas. An inflamed pancreas can then lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, the combination of carrying extra body fat (obesity) and eating a diet high in saturated fat and refined sugars increases the risk of cell damage because of increased immune cell activity.
An anti-inflammatory diet contains foods rich in nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals and limits foods found in a typical Western diet to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. There is also emerging research studying the effects of high-fiber plant-rich diets that support a greater diversity ofbeneficial gut microbes, which may prevent a condition called metabolic endotoxemia. This is a low-grade inflammation that occurs because of an increase in the number of endotoxins, which are believed to cause the inflammation associated with metabolic diseases likecardiovascular diseaseandtype 2 diabetes. [6,7]
The most common causes of leaky gut are drug abuse and food toxins (for example, gluten acting as a toxin in susceptible people with celiac disease). Certain nutrients, such as the amino acids glutamine and tryptophan, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease intestinal permeability by improving the tight junctions. [28]Fiberin the diet can improve the diversity of bacteria in the gut that increases production of short chain fatty acids and other beneficial metabolites, which in turn strengthens the intestinal barrier. Foods rich inprebiotics and probiotics, and probiotic supplements, are also being studied. Much more research is needed to confirm the relationship of dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions, and potential treatments.
An anti-inflammatory diet is a healthful eating plan that may help to reduce chronic low levels of inflammation that otherwise might increase the risk of various chronic diseases. Although research is limited, it may also help to lower inflammatory markers in individuals with autoimmune-type inflammation such as with rheumatoid arthritis. Popular dietary patterns that are anti-inflammatory include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and vegetarian diets. People may seek the guidance of a registered dietitian familiar with any of these dietary patterns to assist with meal planning and appropriate portion sizes. Along with the diet, it is important to incorporate other healthy lifestyle factors that positively affect the body‚Äôs immune response, such as practicingstress reduction,exercising regularly, and getting adequatesleep.

üîó Healthy Living Guide 2020/2021
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2021/01/19/healthy-living-guide-2020-2021/

As we transition from 2020 into 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect nearly every aspect of our lives. For many, this health crisis has created a range of unique and individual impacts‚Äîincluding food access issues, income disruptions, and emotional distress.
Although we do not have concrete evidence regarding specific dietary factors that can reduce risk of COVID-19, we do know that maintaining a healthy lifestyle is critical to keeping our immune system strong. Beyond immunity, research has shown that individuals following five key habits‚Äîeating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, keeping a healthy body weight, not drinking too much alcohol, and not smoking‚Äîlive more than a decade longerthan those who don‚Äôt. Plus, maintaining these practices may not only help us live longer, but also better. Adults following these five key habits at middle-age were found tolive more years free of chronic diseasesincluding type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.
While sticking to healthy habits is often easier said than done, we created this guide with the goal of providing some tips and strategies that may help. During these particularly uncertain times, we invite you to do what you can to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and hopefully (if you‚Äôre able to try out a new recipe or exercise, or pick up a fulfilling hobby) find some enjoyment along the way.

üîó Precision Nutrition
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/precision-nutrition/

Precision nutrition may sound like a new fad diet, but it is actually a credible emerging area of research supported by the National Institutes of Health under the umbrella of precision medicine. [1,2] Precision medicine seeks to improve the personalized treatment of diseases, and precision nutrition is specific to dietary intake. Both develop interventions to prevent or treat chronic diseases based on a person‚Äôs unique characteristics like DNA, race, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Both aim to provide safer and more effective ways to prevent and treat disease by providing more accurate and targeted strategies. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another. How often are we tempted to follow a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or ‚Äúcure‚Äù their diabetes? The concept of precision nutrition would discourage this practice, as our individual blueprint might require a unique dietary plan to be successful.
Precision nutrition also considers themicrobiome, trillions of bacteria in our bodies that play a key role in various daily internal operations. What types and how much bacteria we have are unique to each individual. Our diets can determine which types of bacteria live in our digestive tracts, and according to precision nutrition the reverse is also true: the types of bacteria we house might determine how we break down certain foods and what types of foods are most beneficial for our bodies.
Precision nutrition, also referred to as personalized nutrition, focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases. Yet, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals. [3] The person‚Äôs microbiome was found to cause variations in blood triglycerides after a meal. Non-food factors like sleep, physical activity, and time of meals also played a role in causing variations in blood levels of glucose and triglycerides after meals. [3] Therefore, an individual may see additional benefits if following personalized nutrition guidance beyond general health recommendations. Precision nutrition evaluates one‚Äôs DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease.
There are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: agluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU). However precision nutrition is in its early stages and too soon to introduce as a treatment for chronic diseases in the general population. Research is being conducted on the application of precision nutrition for obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, and type 2diabetes(T2DM).
For example, the traditional management of T2DM targets healthy lifestyle factors (exercise,diet, achieving ahealthy weight), often with use of medications. Precision nutrition can further tailor diabetes management by looking closely at the following areas: [4,5]
Precision nutrition examines how a person‚Äôs DNA may be associated with their response to a food. One example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup?Coffeebeans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content. Research has discovered genes specifically related to coffee intake. [6] These genes may determine how fast or slowly the caffeine in coffee is metabolized. They are also associated with anti-inflammatory effects and a lower risk of certain chronic diseases. Precision nutrition uses genetic data such as this to determine if an individual would benefit from drinking more or less coffee.
Other factors being researched include seeing if a high intake of saturated fat may predispose an individual to weight gain, or if a high salt intake increases one‚Äôs risk of developing high blood pressure. [7] However, findings from these studies have not been replicated in different populations.
The field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges‚Äîa lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual‚Äôs DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. [4] Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease. There may also be differences among findings in clinical trials of the individual metabolic response to a specific diet depending on the types of tests they use; this in turn could cause variation in the personalized nutrition recommendations that are provided.
Primary care physicians, registered dietitians, and other providers directly interacting with an individual need to be educated about precision nutrition, as it requires the combined joint efforts of the entire health care team. Despite individual differences in metabolic response to foods, personalized dietary advice should still align with general nutrition principles (e.g. eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming less added sugar from sugary drinks, limiting sodium, etc.). Although private companies have started to offer genetic and microbiome testing to the public to customize diets, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests.
Ethical and legal aspects of implementing precision nutrition should also be considered, including protecting consumer privacy in the use of precision nutrition technologies and tests. It‚Äôs also important to recognize that personalized approaches may be accessible to only a small segment of the population, which can widen health disparities. We must not lose sight of improving the broader food environment through effective policies, regulations, and other population-based approaches that can help make healthy food choices the default.

üîó Rice
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/rice/

Rice is a main staple in more than 100 countries worldwide. [1] In some households, rice is included with more than one meal a day. This starchy high-calorie grain is generally low cost, making it accessible to all and a vital base of many diets. Each country showcases a rice specialty to reflect local spices and taste preferences: risotto in Italy, paella in Spain, jambalaya in the southern U.S., coconut rice in Colombia, steamed rice in China, rice and beans in Mexico, and sweet rice in Portugal, to name a few.
The scientific name for rice isOryza. Oryza sativais the most common species and is subdivided into the long-grainindica, and short-grainjaponica. Tools for farming rice have been found in China dating back 8000 years. Merchant traders helped the gradual spread of rice across the continents.
(*primarilywhole grainvarieties)
There are thousands of types ofOryza sativa, which can differ in size, thickness, stickiness, color, aroma, and flavor. Rice is often broadly categorized based on its shape or method of processing:
This refers to the length and width of the rice grain after cooking:
Is the rice in its whole, intact form (like ‚Äúbrown‚Äù rice), or has it been milled and polished (like ‚Äúwhite‚Äù rice)?
Of course, when it comes to cooking, specific varieties of rice are often chosen for their unique characteristics. Here are a few popular types:
Because large amounts of rice are eaten in some countries, along with an increasing worldwide prevalence oftype 2 diabetesand insulin resistance, rice intake‚Äôs effect on health has been studied.
The glycemic index(GI) is a measure of how quickly and how much a food raises one‚Äôs blood sugar levels after eating. Rice is considered a high GI food but it varies depending on the type and amount of processing (processing increases the GI). Reports show the GI of rice ranging from 48-93. [2] Low GI foods have a rating of 55 or less, medium GI foods are 56-69, and high GI foods are 70-100. The average GI for brown rice is low at 55, whereas the GI for white rice is higher at 64. [3] Observational studies have found an association between a high GI diet and greater risk for type 2 diabetes.
The message of these studies was consistent with public health recommendations to replace refined grains with whole grains, and to choose at least two servings of whole grains a day to reduce type 2 diabetes risk.
In a large cohort study of 71,750 women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and 42,823 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, intakes of brown rice did not lower the risk of ischemic stroke. [6] However, intakes of brown rice in this group were generally lower than intakes of other grain foods that did decrease stroke risk like whole grain cereals and bran. A systematic review of 45 studies on whole grains did not find a reduced risk of stroke, heart disease, or cancer from intakes of either white or brown rice. [7]
Arsenic is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in soil, rock, and water. The term ‚Äútotal arsenic‚Äù includes organic and inorganic arsenic compounds. Organic arsenic is found mostly in seafood and is considered less toxic. Inorganic arsenic is toxic and found in soil, groundwater, and industrial chemicals. Though a high amount of inorganic arsenic is deadly, long-term exposure to lower levels is also concerning as it may increase the risk of various diseases.
In 2012, reports surfaced about the potentially high levels of inorganic arsenic in rice. [8] The amount in our food supply results largely from contaminated groundwater and soil from livestock manure, fertilizer, pesticides, and industrial waste. [9] This is concerning to individuals who eat rice daily. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term exposure to arsenic can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Exposure to arsenic at young ages has been linked to certain cancers and neurological defects. [1]
Arsenic accumulates in rice 10 times more than in other grains due to being cultivated in water-flooded fields, where irrigation water as well as the soil may be contaminated with arsenic. [10] The rice grain easily absorbs arsenic into its roots through water. In the U.S., rice grown in southern states contains high amounts of arsenic because of residual metals in the soil from the historical use of arsenic-laced pesticides to treat cotton crops. Rice products such as rice cereal and rice crackers may also contain high levels of arsenic. The amount of arsenic in other types of rice such as black or red depends on the exact species and the amount of inorganic arsenic in the soil and water supply, which can vary greatly by region.
There is no federal limit for arsenic in food and beverages other than water. The standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). One report found as much as 193 ppm in brown rice grown in the southern U.S. [2] A later report by the FDA also found high levels with an average concentration of 154 ppb in brown rice. [11]
Early life exposure to arsenic increases the risk of negative health effects later in life. Non-profit organizations have pushed for federal standards limiting the amount of arsenic in the food supply. Congress introduced a bill in 2012 called the RICE Act (Reducing food-based Inorganic and Organic Compounds Exposure Act) to establish limits on the amount of total arsenic allowed in rice and rice products. [12] In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drafted a proposed limit of 100 ppb in infant rice cereal and juice, but further action by the FDA or voluntary standards by manufacturers have not been established. [13] The FDA advised that parents give infants a variety of fortified cereals other than rice such as oat, barley, and multigrain. Pregnant women and toddlers should also eat a variety of whole grains other than rice. [14]
Additional ways to reduce arsenic exposure from rice:
If you eat brown rice or brown rice products frequently or more than four times a week, consider purchasing brands grown in non-polluted regions (such as California as opposed to Arkansas or Texas).

üîó Diet Review: Paleo Diet for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/paleo-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The Paleolithic or ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù diet seeks to address 21stcentury ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Our predecessors used simple stone tools that were not advanced enough to grow and cultivate plants, so they hunted, fished, and gathered wild plants for food. If they lived long enough, they were believed to experience less modern-day diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease because of a consistent diet of lean meats and plant foods along with a high level of physical activity from intensive hunting. However, the life expectancy of our predecessors was only a fraction of that of people today.
The popularity of the Paleo diet, which hit a peak in 2014, appealed to consumers‚Äô increasing desire to eat more healthfully and to know where their food was coming from. [1]
The Paleo diet, also referred to as the caveman or Stone-Age diet, includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Proponents of the diet emphasize choosinglow-glycemicfruits and vegetables. There is debate about several aspects of the Paleo diet: what foods actually existed at the time, the variation in diets depending on region (e.g., tropical vs. Arctic), how modern-day fruits and vegetables bear little resemblance to prehistoric wild versions, and disagreement among Paleo diet enthusiasts on what is included/excluded from the diet. Because of these differences, there is not one ‚Äútrue‚Äù Paleo diet.
For example, although white potatoes were recorded as being available during the Paleolithic era, they are usually avoided on the Paleo diet because of their high glycemic index. Processed foods are also technically off limits due to an emphasis on fresh foods, but some Paleo diets allow frozen fruits and vegetables because the freezing process preserves most nutrients.
Overall, the diet is high inprotein, moderate infat(mainly fromunsaturated fats), low-moderate incarbohydrate(specifically restricting highglycemic indexcarbohydrates), high infiber, and low in sodium and refined sugars. [2] The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (including the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA) come from marine fish, avocado, olive oil, and nuts and seeds.
Grass-fed beef is often highlighted on the diet, which is promoted to contain moreomega-3 fatsthan conventional beef (due to being fed grass instead of grain). It does contain small amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, only a small proportion of ALA can be converted in the body to long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). The amount of omega-3 is also highly variable depending on the exact feeding regimen and differences in fat metabolism among cattle breeds. [3] In general, the amount of omega-3 in grass-fed beef is much lower than that in oily marine fish. [3] Cooked salmon contains 1000-2000 mg of EPA/DHA per 3-ounce portion, whereas 3 ounces of grass-fed beef contains about 20-200 mg of ALA.
Some randomized controlled trials have shown the Paleo diet to produce greater short-term benefits than diets based on national nutrition guidelines, including greater weight loss, reduced waist circumference, decreased blood pressure, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cholesterol. However these studies were of short duration (6 months or less) with a small number of participants (less than 40). [4-6]
One larger randomized controlled trial followed 70 post-menopausal Swedish women with obesity for two years, who were placed on either a Paleo diet or a Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) diet. [7] The Paleo diet provided 30% of total calories from protein, 40% fat (from mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and 30% carbohydrates. It included lean meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, avocado, and olive oil. The NNR diet provided less protein and fat but more carbohydrate with 15% protein, 25-30% fat, and 55-60% carbohydrates, including foods similar to the Paleo diet but also low-fat dairy products and high-fiber grains. Both groups significantly decreased fat mass and weight circumference at 6 and 24 months, with the Paleo diet producing greater fat loss at 6 months but not at 24 months. Triglyceride levels decreased more significantly with the Paleo diet at 6 and 24 months than the NNR diet.
The Paleo diet includes nutrient-dense whole fresh foods and encourages participants to steer away from highly processed foods containing added salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. However, the omission of whole grains, dairy, and legumes could lead to suboptimal intake of important nutrients. The restrictive nature of the diet may also make it difficult for people to adhere to such a diet in the long run.¬† More high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year that compare the Paleo diet with other weight-reducing diets are needed to show a direct health benefit of the Paleo diet. Strong recommendations for the Paleo diet for weight loss cannot be made at this time.

üîó Almonds
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/almonds/

The almond is a tree nut native to the Mediterranean region. Historically, almond trees grew there wild and were later cultivated as early as 3000 BC. Almonds are even referenced in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, as a prized food given as gifts. The edible part of the almond is actually a seed from a drupe, a fruit in which the outer shell and hull layers are typically not eaten. After extracting the almond seed, the shells and hulls are often used for livestock feed and bedding.
One serving of almonds equals one ounce, about 23 almonds or ¬º cup. It is a calorie-dense food but also nutrient-dense with the majority of its fat being monounsaturated. One ounce provides about 165 calories, 6 grams protein, 14 grams fat (80% monounsaturated, 15% polyunsaturated, and 5% saturated), 6 grams carbohydrate, and 3 grams fiber.
Almonds have been suggested to reduce heart disease risk by lowering total and LDL cholesterol, and exerting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Plant sterols as found in almonds may interfere with the absorption of cholesterol and bile acid, and the high amount of unsaturated fat in almonds favors an improved lipid profile, especially when this food replaces other foods high insaturated fatandrefined carbohydrate. Almonds also contain phytonutrients that support the growth of beneficial gut microbes. Controlled trials have shown that general nut intake can decrease inflammation, promote healthy blood vessels, and reduce insulin resistance. [1]
Interestingly, despite nuts being calorie-dense, research does not support a link with nut intake and weight gain. In fact, they have been associated with less weight gain and a lower risk of obesity, possibly because the fat and fiber content help to improve feelings of satisfaction and fullness. [1]
There is limited evidence examining the intake of almonds in large populations. Smaller controlled trials have looked specifically at almonds, but larger observational studies tend to examine nuts in general, because consumption of individual nuts is relatively low in the population. Observational studies looking at intakes of nuts have found a significantly lower risk of heart disease in those eating nuts at least four times a week. [2] Small randomized controlled trials have found consistent benefits of diets supplemented with nuts‚Äîincluding almonds‚Äîon reducing total and LDL cholesterol in blood.
A large epidemiological study of health professionals that looked at general nut intake found that tree nuts including almonds eaten two or more times weekly was associated with a 13% lower risk of total cardiovascular disease and 15% lower risk of coronary heart disease. [1]¬† Another large prospective study of Swedish adults found that those who ate nuts 1-2 times a week had a 12% reduced risk of a heart rhythm abnormality called atrial fibrillation, and 18% reduced risk if eaten 3 or more times a week, when compared with adults who ate no nuts. [4] There was also a 20% reduced risk of heart failure in those eating nuts 1-2 times a week compared with no-nut eaters.
Meta-analyses have found that a higher nut intake is associated with reduced risk of total cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and deaths from all causes. These studies had conflicting results in showing a protective effect of nut intake from diabetes, respiratory disease, stroke, and infections. [5-8]
Because earlier scientific evidence suggested a heart disease benefit of eating nuts, in 2003 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved manufacturers to state on food labels that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.

üîó Oats
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/oats/

Oats, formally namedAvena sativa, is a type of cereal grain from thePoaceaegrass family of plants. The grain refers specifically to the edible seeds of oat grass, which is what ends up in our breakfast bowls. Whether loved or hated for their mushy yet hearty texture when cooked, oats are most prized for their nutritional value and health benefits. The Food and Drug Administration allows the use of a health claim on food labels associating a reduced risk of coronary heart disease with the consumption of beta-glucan soluble fiber fromwhole grainoats. [1] Oatmeal is also a desired asset to those trying to lose weight and control hunger levels due to its high water and soluble fiber content.
Oats contain several components that have been proposed to exert health benefits. The primary type of soluble fiber in oats is beta-glucan, which has been researched to help slow digestion, increase satiety, and suppress appetite. Beta-glucan can bind with cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestine and transport them through the digestive tract and eventually out of the body. Whole oats also contain plant chemicals called phenolic compounds and phytoestrogens that act as antioxidants to reduce the damaging effects of chronic inflammation that is associated with various diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [2]
Because available research specific to oats is limited, most of the studies below assessed whole grain intake, which included several types of whole grains in addition to oats. Therefore, the findings cannot be applied to oats alone.

üîó Superfoods or Superhype?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/superfoods/

‚ÄúSuperfoods,‚Äù ‚Äúpower foods,‚Äù ‚Äútop 10 foods‚Äù‚Äîdo these titles catch your attention? For those of us seeking to improve our health, the notion of a superfood can be appealing. We may imagine a powerful food with special abilities like promoting weight loss or healing disease. There‚Äôs no scientifically based or regulated definition for superfood, but generally, a food is promoted to superfood status when it offers high levels of desirable nutrients, is linked to the prevention of a disease, or is believed to offer several simultaneous health benefits beyond its nutritional value. Its inclusion in theMerriam-WebsterDictionaryconfirms its widespread use, which defines a superfood as ‚Äúa food (such as salmon, broccoli, or blueberries) that is rich in compounds (such as antioxidants, fiber, or fatty acids) considered beneficial to a person‚Äôs health.‚Äù
Where did the term superfood originate? Interestingly, not from those who formally study food, such as nutrition scientists and dietitians. The earliest recorded example may have taken place in the early 20thcentury around World War I, used as part of a food marketing strategy. The United Fruit Company initiated an enthusiastic advertising campaign to promote its major import of bananas. It published informational pamphlets includingPoints About Bananasand theFood Value of the Banana. [1] Initially the company had advertised the practicality ofbananasin a daily diet, being cheap, nutritious, easily digested, available everywhere, good when cooked and not cooked, and sealed by nature in a germ-proof package. To get people to eat more, they suggested adding bananas in cereal for breakfast, in salads for lunch, and fried with meat for dinner.
However, the popularity of the term soared after being endorsed in medical journals, due to physicians publishing their findings of a banana diet to treat conditions like celiac disease and diabetes. [2] The American Medical Association announced that bananas in a child‚Äôs diet would provide relief for celiac disease or cure it (glutenhad not yet been discovered as the true culprit). Bananas soon bore an emblem of health, and mothers made bananas a dietary staple for their children and infants even if they did not have celiac disease. The United Fruit Company included these health benefits in its promotional material and the popular press flaunted headlines about bananas, birthing the banana diet craze.
The difference in the 21stcentury is that information now spreads at viral speed so that a new superfood seems to appear on a monthly basis. The essentials are in place: scientific research on a particular food, catchy headlines from the fast-paced popular press, as well as infomercials and marketing campaigns of involved food industries.
Superfoods often translate into super sales that have created a billion-dollar industry. According to a Nielson survey, consumers are willing to pay more for foods perceived as healthy, and health claims on labels seem to help. Interestingly, foods already perceived as healthy that also carry a health claim show the greatest sales. [3] This may be due to providing added confirmation of a consumer‚Äôs knowledge about a healthful food, increasing the likelihood they will purchase it. The survey also shows that about 80% of respondents see ‚Äúfood as medicine‚Äù and eat certain foods to prevent health problems like obesity,diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol. No surprise then that plant-based foods likefruits,vegetables, andwhole grains, which are generally perceived as health-promoting, often top superfoods lists.
The food industry certainly has the incentive to market a product as a superfood, which boosts sales. According to Mintel research, in 2015 there was a 36% increase globally in the number of foods and beverages launched that were labeled as a ‚Äúsuperfood,‚Äù ‚Äúsuperfruit,‚Äù or ‚Äúsupergrain,‚Äù with the United States leading those product launches. [4]Quinoaand other ancient grains,chia seeds, andkaleenjoyed consistent sales growth in 2017. ¬†A recent list of the top 13 trending ingredients based on data from food and beverage startup companies include pea protein, seaweed, ginger, turmeric, matcha,oats, barley, andchickpeas. [5]

Superfoods are often nutritious but it‚Äôs clear that the term is more useful for driving sales than it is for providing optimal nutrition recommendations. A downside of superfoods is that the title alone may cause people to focus on a few specific foods, blinding them to other equally nutritious options that aren‚Äôt as hyped. Variety in our diet is important not only to gain the benefit of eating a wide array of essential vitamins and minerals, but also to prevent one from eating too much (or too little) of a particular nutrient. It also keeps our meals interesting and flavorful!
So yes,explore individual foodsand learn how to select, prepare, and enjoy them‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be distracted by the latest overhyped food or fad. Instead, focus on creating a ‚Äúsuper plate‚Äù full of different healthy and flavorful foods. Need some inspiration? Check out theHealthy Eating Plateto get started.

üîó Whole Grains
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/

Choose whole grains instead of refined grains.
Whole grains offer a ‚Äúcomplete package‚Äù of health benefits, unlike refined grains, which are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process.
All whole grain kernels contain three parts: the bran, germ, and endosperm. Each section houses health-promoting nutrients. The bran is thefiber-rich outer layer that suppliesB vitamins,iron, copper,zinc,magnesium,antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are natural chemical compounds in plants that have been researched for their role in disease prevention. The germ is the core of the seed where growth occurs; it is rich in healthy fats,vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. The endosperm is the interior layer that holds carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals.
These components have various effects on our bodies:
The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat‚Äôs B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.
A growing body of research shows that choosing whole grains and other less-processed, higher-quality sources of carbohydrates, and cutting back on refined grains, improves health in many ways. For a closer look at carbohydrates, check out ourCarbohydrate Guide.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1]¬†However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains:
Be careful when choosing foods labeled as whole grains: ‚ÄúWhole grain‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean healthy.
One study revealed that inconsistent food labeling means that foods identified as ‚Äúwhole grain‚Äù are not always healthy.¬†[2]
Consumers should steer towards whole grain foods that are high in fiber and that have few ingredients in addition to whole grain. Moreover, eating whole grains in their¬†whole¬†forms‚Äîsuch asbrown rice, barley,oats, corn, and rye‚Äîare healthy choices because they pack in the nutritional benefits of whole grains without any additional ingredients.
As researchers have begun to look more closely at carbohydrates and health, they are learning thatthe quality of the carbohydratesyou eat is at least as important as the quantity. Most studies, including some from several different Harvard teams, show a connection between whole grains and better health.¬†[3]
Cardiovascular disease
Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.
Type 2 diabetes
Replacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes. [8]¬†In contrast, refined grains tend to have a high glycemic index and glycemic load with less fiber and nutrients.
Cancer
The data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect of whole grains and others showing none. [12,13]
Digestive health
By keeping the stool soft and bulky, the fiber in whole grains helps prevent constipation, a common, costly, and aggravating problem. It also helps prevent diverticular disease (diverticulosis) by decreasing pressure in the intestines.¬†[17]
Some grains contain the naturally-occurring protein, gluten. While gluten can cause side effects in certain individuals, such as those with celiac disease, most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives‚Äîwithout any adverse reaction. However, negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet, though there is little published research to support such claims.

üîó Omega-3 Fatty Acids: An Essential Contribution
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/

The human body can make most of the types of fats it needs from other fats or carbohydrates. That isn‚Äôt the case for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (also called omega-3 fats andn-3 fats). These are essential fats‚Äîthe body can‚Äôt make them from scratch but must get them from food. Foods high in omega-3 include certain fish and seafood, some vegetable oils, nuts (especially walnuts), flax seeds, and leafy vegetables.
What makes omega-3 fats special? They are needed to build cell membranes throughout the body and affect the function of the cell receptors in these membranes. They also provide the starting point for making hormones that regulate blood clotting, contraction and relaxation of artery walls, and inflammation. In addition, they can bind to receptors in cells that regulate genetic function. Due to these effects, omega-3 fats can help prevent heart disease and stroke, may help control lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis, and may play protective roles in cancer and other conditions. [1]
There are two main types of omega-3 fats that have essential roles in human health:
The strongest evidence for a beneficial effect of omega-3 fats has to do with heart disease. These fats appear to help the heart beat at a steady clip and not veer into a dangerous or potentially fatal erratic rhythm. [2] Such arrhythmias cause most of the 500,000-plus cardiac deaths that occur each year in the United States. Omega-3 fats also lower blood pressure and heart rate, and improve blood vessel function. At higher doses, they lower triglycerides and may ease inflammation, which plays a role in the development of atherosclerosis. [2]
Given the wide-ranging importance of marine omega-3 fatty acids, it is important to eat fish or other seafood 1-2 times a week, particularly fatty (dark meat) fish that is richer in EPA and DHA. [3] This is especially important for women who are pregnant or hoping to become pregnant and nursing mothers. From the third trimester until the second year of life, a developing child needs a steady supply of DHA to form the brain and other parts of the nervous system as DHA is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain. Many women shy away from eating fish because of concerns that mercury and other possible contaminants might harm their babies, [4] yet the evidence for harm from lack of omega-3 fats is far more consistent, and a balance of benefit vs. risk is easily obtained by limiting intake of the types of fish higher in mercury. (To learn more about the controversy over contaminants in fatty fish, readFish: Friend or Foe.)
Researchers are also looking at the effects of marine and plant omega-3 fats on prostate cancer. Results from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and others show that men whose diets are rich in EPA and DHA (mainly from fish and seafood) are less likely to develop advanced prostate cancer than those with low intakes of EPA and DHA. [5] At the same time, some studies show an increase in prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer among men with high intakes of ALA (mainly from supplements). However, this effect is inconsistent. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, for example, there was no link between ALA intake and early, late, or advanced prostate cancer. [6] Also, in a recent analysis, ALA intake was not associated with higher risk of prostate cancer after about 2005. [7] This is consistent with concerns that partial hydrogenation of ALA in vegetable oils was responsible for the increase in prostate cancer; partial hydrogenation was greatly reduced after 2005 as part of efforts to reduce consumption of trans fats.
Unlike EPA/DHA, there is much less research on the health benefits of ALA. Though part of the health benefits of ALA may be attributed to its conversion to EPA/DHA, ALA alone may offer modest protection against cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. [8] However, more observational studies and clinical trials are needed. ALA is an important source of omega-3 fats for those who have a fish allergy or who eat a vegan diet.
If you don‚Äôt eat fish, is taking a supplement just as good? Fish oil pills contain both EPA and DHA. Research strongly supports that eating a diet with fatty fish weekly provides protection from cardiovascular disease. However, many large clinical trials have not shown that taking omega-3 supplements provide the same protection. [1,9] There may be a threshold of benefit, in which a certain amount of omega-3 might be protective, but higher dosages such as found in supplements may not further reduce risk. Another reason could be the increased use of highly effective statin medications, which might outshine any modest benefit provided from omega-3 supplements.
A scientific advisory from the American Heart Association reviewed the results of large randomized controlled trials studying the effects of marine-based omega-3 supplements (e.g., fish oil) on cardiovascular disease. [10] The review included the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell‚ÄôInfarto Miocardio (GISSI Prevention Trial), Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), Effect of Omega 3-Fatty Acids on the Reduction of Sudden Cardiac Death After Myocardial Infarction Trial (OMEGA), Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Prevention of Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation Trial (OPERA), Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention Trial (ORIGIN), and Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL). [10-12] The authors of the advisory observed that the earlier trials showed benefit in reducing cardiac deaths, but not later studies. This could be because more people were consuming fatty fish rich in omega-3 during the recent trials, so that taking supplements did not offer more benefit. Another reason is that the use of statins, beta-blockers, and other heart medications were used in more patients in later trials, so that any benefit of taking omega-3 supplements was decreased. However, the authors stated that because omega-3 supplements are relatively safe and the review showed a modest 10% reduction in deaths from heart disease, they felt that using these supplements was reasonable for people with existing heart disease. However, there was not enough evidence to recommend supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
The Food and Drug Administration specifies that the labels of dietary supplements should not recommend a daily intake of EPA and DHA higher than 2000 mg due to lack of evidence. For people with heart disease, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends 1000 mg daily of EPA and DHA, preferably from fish, but supplements can be considered in consultation with a physician. In specific cases, such as to lower triglycerides, the AHA recommends 2000‚Äì4000 mg daily of EPA and DHA under a doctor‚Äôs supervision.
An alternative to fish oil is algal oil, derived from algae, the omega-3-rich ocean plants eaten by small marine life that is consumed by larger fatty fish. Algal oil contains mostly DHA, and although costlier than fish oil supplements, it is vegan and more sustainably produced without reliance on marine fishing. A review of randomized controlled trials found that algal oil supplementation may help to reduce triglycerides in people without established heart disease. [13]
Omega-3 supplements can act as a mild blood thinner and may increase the risk of bleeding. Inform your doctor if you begin using these supplements as they may also interact with some medications, especially blood thinners.
Prior to 1950, cattle were typically allowed to pasture and consume a diet of mostly grass. As demands for production increased, cattle were instead fed high-calorie grains made from soy or corn that also created a desirable marbling of the meat from the higher fat content. Today, most cows in the U.S. are still generally fed a grain-based diet; to further speed growth they may be given growth hormone and are restricted in movement.
One might imagine that cows fed primarily grass would be exposed to a more natural habitat of grazing freely and consuming native vegetation, high in nutrients and omega-3 fats. However, the term ‚Äúgrass-fed‚Äù is not a regulated term and does not always indicate that cattle are allowed to graze in pastures. They may simply be fed grass or vegetation in a confined space. The United States Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Agricultural Marketing Service offers a voluntary certification that specifies that cattle are fed only grass and forage (or hay and alfalfa during low pasture growth) and no grain or grain byproducts during their lifetime. [14]
Regardless if cattle are grain or grass-fed, the majority of fat in the beef is saturated, and the amount of total saturated fat is similar regardless of feeding type. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat is also similar for grain or grass-fed cattle, but generally grass-fed beef is leaner with less total fat. [14]
Among grass-fed cows, the amount of omega-3 can vary by types of pasture used for grazing and by the age and breed, as genetics play a role in how fat is stored. Beef from grass-fed cows contains slightly higher levels of omega-3 fat than grain-fed, mainly as ALA (different from the EPA/DHA found in fish). [15] But there is little comparison, as the amount of omega-3 in fatty fish is about 10 times the amount in grass-fed beef. Even plant foods that contain ALA generally offer higher amounts than grass-fed beef. This is represented in the table below, which compares 3 ounces of beef, salmon, and walnuts. Even a more typical 1 ounce serving of walnuts provides over 2500 mg of ALA‚Äîabout 30 times the amount in a 3 ounce serving of grass-fed beef. Therefore grass-fed beef, though a source of ALA, is not a significant contributor of omega-3 fat in our diets.

Most Americans take in far more of another essential fat‚Äîomega-6 fats‚Äîthan they do omega-3 fats. Like omega-3 fats, omega-6 fats are a critical part of the structure of every cell of our body and are building blocks for hormones that regulate inflammation, narrowing of blood vessels, and blood clotting. Normally, these are important functions that protect the body from injury and infection, but a popular claim is that an excess intake of omega-6 fats can over-stimulate these functions, causing more harm than benefit. In addition, because omega-3 and omega-6 fats compete for the same enzymes to produce other fatty acids, it is believed that eating an excess of one type may interfere with the metabolism of the other, thereby reducing its beneficial effects. [15]
Some researchers have proposed that a higher intake of omega-6 fats compared with omega-3 fats (also referred to as the omega-6/omega-3 ratio) could contribute to the development of chronic health conditions, like cardiovascular disease and cancer, but this has not been supported by evidence in humans. [1,16] Very consistently, carefully controlled feeding studies do not show that omega-6 fats increase inflammatory factors. [17]
Many studies and trials in humans support cardiovascular benefit of omega-6 fats. In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats wasn‚Äôt linked with heart disease risk because both of these fats were beneficial. [18] In a large prospective study of men and women who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes at the start of the study, the highest intakes of omega-6 fats were more strongly linked with lower death rates from these diseases than intakes of omega-3 fats. [19]
There is no question that many Americans could benefit from increasing their intake of omega-3 fats, but there is also evidence that omega-6 fats reduce cardiovascular risk factors and heart disease. Thus, the omega-6/omega-3 ratio is not a useful indicator of the healthfulness of a food or diet. Like many essential nutrients, it is possible that too much can cause problems. However in the U.S. diet, we have not been able to find individuals or groups who are consuming excessive amounts of omega-6 fatty acids.

üîó Ask the expert: Omega-3 fatty acids

Professor of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health
1. What are omega-3 fatty acids, and why should I make sure to include them in my diet?
Omega-3 fatty acids (also known as n-3 fatty acids) are polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential nutrients for health. We need omega-3 fatty acids for numerous normal body functions, such as controlling blood clotting and building cell membranes in the brain, and since our bodies cannot make omega-3 fats, we must get them through food. Omega-3 fatty acids are also associated with many health benefits, including protection against heart disease and possibly stroke. New studies are identifying potential benefits for a wide range of conditions including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
2. What foods are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids? How much do I need to eat of these foods to get enough omega-3s?
There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in some vegetable oils, such as soybean, rapeseed (canola), and flaxseed, and in walnuts. ALA is also found in some green vegetables, such asBrussels sprouts,kale, spinach, and salad greens. The other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA.
We do not know whether vegetable or fish omega-3 fatty acids are equally beneficial, although both seem to be beneficial. Unfortunately, most Americans do not get enough of either type. For good health, you should aim to get at least one rich source of omega-3 fatty acids in your diet every day. This could be through a serving of fatty fish (such as salmon), a tablespoon of canola or soybean oil in salad dressing or in cooking, or a handful of walnuts or ground flaxseed mixed into your morning oatmeal.
3. What are omega-6 fatty acids? Should I be concerned about the ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids in my diet?
Omega-6 fatty acids (also known as n-6 fatty acids) are also polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential nutrients, meaning that our bodies cannot make them and we must obtain them from food. They are abundant in the Western diet; common sources include safflower, corn, cottonseed, and soybean oils.
Omega-6 fatty acids lower LDL cholesterol (the ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol) and reduce inflammation, and they are protective against heart disease. So both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are healthy. While there is a theory that omega-3 fatty acids are better for our health than omega-6 fatty acids, this is not supported by the latest evidence. Thus the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio is basically the ‚Äúgood divided by the good,‚Äù so it is of no value in evaluating diet quality or predicting disease.
4. Is it better to get omega-3 fatty acids from food or from supplements?
Certainly foods, since the plants and fish that contain omega-3 fats have other good nutrients, such as protein, vitamins and minerals. People who do not eat fish or other foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids should consider taking an omega-3 supplement of 500 mg per day; fish oil is used in supplements, but there are also vegetarian supplements that have ALA. Studies suggest that people who have already had a heart attack may benefit from higher doses of omega-3 supplements (basically, double the 500 mg), so if you do have heart disease, consult your healthcare provider about whether taking a higher dose of omega 3s makes sense for you.
5. I am a vegetarian, so I do not consume any fish. But I get plenty of ALA in my diet, from canola and soybean oil, ground flax seed, and walnuts. How efficiently does the body convert ALA to DHA and EPA? Should I take an algal DHA supplement?
If you are getting adequate ALA in your diet from oils and nuts, I am not sure you really need to take an algal DHA supplement. As I mentioned above, the body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA; it is not known if ALA has substantial health benefits as is, or whether it must be converted to EPA and DHA to produce most of the benefits. My current interpretation of the science is that ALA is important to nutrition because it is an essential fatty acid, and that at least part of its benefits come from its conversion to EPA and DHA. I don‚Äôt advocate that vegans take n-3 supplements if they are getting ALA from vegetable oils, vegetables, walnuts, and other vegetarian sources as described above.
6. Can omega-3 fatty acids be destroyed by high-heat cooking?
Not if the oil is fresh. In fact, even in frying oil that is used for days, you still can find ALA in it.

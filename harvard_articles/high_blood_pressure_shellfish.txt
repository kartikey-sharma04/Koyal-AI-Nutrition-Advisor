üîó Copper
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/copper/

Copper is a naturally occurring metal found in soil, water, and rocks. Nutritionally, it is an essential trace mineral found in some foods and in supplements. It works to assist various enzymes that produce energy for the body, break down and absorb iron, and build red blood cells, collagen, connective tissue, and brain neurotransmitters. Copper also supports normal brain development and immune functions, and is a component of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that dismantles harmful oxygen ‚Äúfree radicals.‚Äù Copper is absorbed in the small intestine and found mainly in bones and muscle tissue.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 900 micrograms daily for men and women. Pregnancy and lactation in adults 19+ years requires 1,300 micrograms daily, with a slightly lower amount of 1,000 micrograms daily in younger ages 14-18 years.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for copper for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 10,000 micrograms daily.
Because dozens of enzymes use copper to perform metabolic processes throughout the body, it is believed that both an excess and deficiency of copper may interrupt these normal processes and a stable level is required for optimal health. The body is typically efficient at stabilizing copper levels (absorption increases if copper intake is low, and vice versa). [1] Abnormal copper levels result from genetic mutations, aging, or environmental influences that may predispose to conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. [2]
Copper can have ‚Äúpro-oxidant‚Äù effects that potentially cause stress and damage to cells. The muscles in the heart contain high concentrations of copper, and may be negatively affected by either a deficiency or toxicity of the mineral. [3] Both conditions have been associated with atherogenesis, the early build-up of plaque in heart arteries. [3,4] Some cohort studies show an association with higher self-reported intakes of copper and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, as well as increased risk ofheart diseasewith a copper deficiency. [3,5] Other cohort studies show an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in people with higher copper blood levels compared with lower levels, although it should be noted that the higher blood levels in these studies remained within a normal range. [4,6] Due to these mixed findings, more research is needed before making conclusions on the cardiovascular effect of copper.
Some research shows that those with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), but both low and high blood levels of copper have been reported in the brains of people with AD. [1] A meta-analysis showed that people with AD had higher serum copper levels than those without AD. [7] However, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not show that copper supplements given for 12 months improved cognition in participants with mild AD. [8] Additionally, observational prospective studies have not found that self-reported dietary and total copper intakes are associated with cognitive decline. [1] More research is needed to better understand if and how high or low levels of copper are associated with AD risk.
Copper may play a role incancerfor several reasons. It supports angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor, and activates enzymes and signaling proteins used by cancer cells. [9,10] An emerging area of research has focused on the role of copper in metastatic cancer cells (these are cells that break away from a primary tumor and spread to other areas in the body). [11] Levels of copper in these aggressive cells were found to be higher than in non-metastatic cancer cells. Intentionally depleting copper levels by blocking its bioavailability may reduce the energy these cells need to travel in the body. Chelation-based treatments that bind to and inactivate copper are being researched. [10]
Copper is found in highest amounts inprotein foodslike organ meats,shellfish,fish,nuts, and seeds as well aswhole grainsandchocolate. The absorption of copper in the body will increase if the diet contains less copper, and decrease if the body has enough copper.
A copper deficiency is rare in the U.S. among healthy people and occurs primarily in people with genetic disorders or malabsorption problems such as Crohn‚Äôs and celiac disease. A genetic condition called Menkes disease interferes with copper absorption, leading to severe deficiency that could become fatal without copper injections. Also, it is possible to create a copper deficiency by taking high doses ofzincsupplements that can block the absorption of copper in the small intestine.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals as the body is efficient at excreting excess copper. It has been seen with Wilson‚Äôs disease, a rare genetic condition, that prevents copper from exiting the body and therefore leading to high blood levels. Severe liver damage and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may occur. Although very rare, it is possible to consume excess copper if continuously storing and then serving boiling liquids from corroding copper or brass vessels.
Although copper is naturally found in water, excessive levels of copper in drinking water is usually caused by leaked copper from old, corroded household pipes and faucets. There is greater risk if water is stagnant from lack of use or using hot tap water (copper more easily dissolves at higher temperatures). In these cases, exposure to excess copper can be decreased by running cold tap water for several minutes before using. It is also advised to use only cold tap water for drinking and cooking, and to avoid drinking hot tap water.

üîó Iodine
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/iodine/

Iodine is an essential trace mineral not made by the body so must be obtained by food or supplements. It is found naturally in some foods and is added to supplements and some salt seasonings. Iodine is needed to make the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which assist with the creation of proteins and enzyme activity, as well as regulating normal metabolism. Without enough iodine, these thyroid hormones do not work properly and can lead to an under-active or overactive thyroid gland, causing the medical conditions of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism with various negative side effects in the body.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for iodine is 150 micrograms (mcg) daily for adult men and women 19+ years, and 220 and 290 mcg daily for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. [1,2]
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. The UL for iodine for adults 19+ years and pregnant and lactating women is 1,100 mcg daily.
Production of thyroid hormones increases during pregnancy, requiring higher intakes of iodine. Both the fetus and infant require enough iodine for normal physical growth and brain development. Breast milk contains iodine, though the amount will depend on the mother‚Äôs diet, and many infant formulas contain iodine. However, not all prenatal multivitamins contain iodine. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that prenatal and lactating women take supplemental iodine by using iodized salt. [2] High-dose iodine supplements are not always advised, as they can cause thyroid problems in some women.
Moderate to severe iodine deficiency in children can cause a lower IQ and stunted growth. Iodine supplementation in these children appears to improve both their physical and mental development.
These conditions occur when the body produce too little (hypothyroidism) or too much (hyperthyroidism) thyroid hormone. An early sign of hypothyroidism is having an elevated blood level of of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This may occur with low intakes of iodine. It may also occur in people with a history of iodine deficiency who take high doses of iodine such as in supplements. [1] Goiter, a lump in the front of the neck from an enlarged inflamed thyroid gland, can result from hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or an excessive iodine intake (usually involves taking very high doses of more than 18,000 mcg a day for a prolonged time). [1] Relatedly,goitrogensin some cruciferous vegetables can prevent the absorption of iodine, which may then interfere with thyroid function and cause goiter. Those already with an iodine deficiency or hypothyroidism are most susceptible.
Iodine is found in soil and the ocean, which varies in amount and will affect how much of the mineral is contained in a food. Iodine is found mainly in animal protein foods and sea vegetables, and to a lesser extent in fortified foods like breads, cereals, and milk.
Iodine regulates metabolism, the conversion of energy obtained from food into energy to help cells function and grow. A deficiency of iodine can therefore prevent normal growth and development. This is especially dangerous in pregnant women and infants, in which miscarriage, stillbirth, stunted growth, and cognitive impairments (difficulties with reading, writing, talking, problem solving, social skills) can occur. In adults, an iodine deficiency of less than 10-20 mcg a day can lead to inadequate thyroid hormone production, called hypothyroidism, which disrupts normal metabolic functions like regulating heart rate, body temperature, and body weight. [2] A lump or swelling in the neck, called goiter, often accompanies hypothyroidism. Other signs of hypothyroidism include:
People at risk for iodine deficiency include those who do not use iodized salt or supplements containing iodine, pregnant women, vegans who do not eat any animal foods, and those living in areas with low levels of iodine in the soil (e.g., mountainous regions).
High iodine intakes are usually well-tolerated in most healthy people and do not cause problems. [1] This has been observed in countries such as Japan and Korea that eat iodine-rich seaweed regularly. [3] But some people with autoimmune thyroid disease or who have a history of chronic iodine deficiency can be sensitive to receiving extra iodine, inducing conditions of iodine deficiency like hypothyroidism and goiter. [2,4] Excess iodine can also lead to too much thyroid hormone production, causing hyperthyroidism; signs of this condition are an increased metabolism that promotes weight loss, fast or irregular heartbeat, hand tremors, irritability, fatigue, and sweatiness. Sometimes even just a slight increase in dietary iodine above the RDA can cause iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in sensitive individuals. [4]
Some epidemiologic studies have shown that high seaweed intakes are associated with an increased risk of certain types of thyroid cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, but the exact mechanism is unclear. [2,3]
Excess iodine intake may come from use of high-dose supplements or overeating certain seaweeds and salts that contain iodine. Severe iodine poisoning is rare, but symptoms include fever; stomach pain; nausea; vomiting; a burning sensation of the mouth, throat, and stomach; and even coma. [2] Children, infants, the elderly, and those with existing thyroid disease are particularly vulnerable to iodine toxicity and iodine-induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. [3,4]

üîó Aquatic Foods
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/aquatic-foods/

Foods like salmon, lobster, and shrimp, are often categorized as ‚Äúseafood.‚Äù But how might you classify these foods when including a freshwater fish, such as trout? Consider the termaquatic foods(also calledblue foods), which include any animals, plants, and microorganisms that originate in bodies of water. Examples are:
Aquatic foods can be farmed or wild-caught, and are sourced from inland waters like lakes, rivers, and wetlands; coastal areas like estuaries, mangroves, or near-shore; and marine or ocean waters. Despite currently being an important contribution to healthy diets for billions of people globally, aquatic foods are often undervalued nutritionally because their diversity tends to be restricted to protein or energy value, or framed as a monolithic category of ‚Äúseafood or fish.‚Äù [1]However, there is broad diversity of aquatic foods produced throughout the world and available during every season. Currently, wild fisheries harvest over 2,370 species and aquaculture growers farm approximately 624 species. [2]
Because aquatic foods are so nutrient rich, food technologists have innovated methods to create processed fish products, including fish powders for infants, fish wafers as a snack, and fish chutneys. [1]
This page will focus primarily on animal sources of aquatic foods rather than plant sources.
Certain aquatic animal foods are a major dietary source of two polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (PUFAs)‚Äîdocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These fatty acids are initially produced by certain types of algae, which are then eaten by aquatic animals so that the fats accumulate in their tissues or organs. Omega-3s are found in all aquatic foods, but particularly in the fatty tissue of oily fish like salmon and mackerel, the liver of lean white fish like cod and halibut, and the blubber or thick layer of fat under the skin of marine animals like seals and whales. Smaller amounts are also found in crustaceans, bivalves, and cephalopods. [3]Supplements of fish oil, algal oil, and krill oil also contain DHA and/or EPA. Much of the research on aquatic foods and human health focuses on these omega-3s.
Seafood intake is associated with reduced inflammation and blood pressure, and is protective from stroke and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Eating just 1-2 servings of fish weekly reduces the risk of death from heart disease by 36%. [3] This is not solely due to the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, but to other components in seafood, such as vitamins B6 and B12 that maintain normal levels ofhomocysteine. [4] Omega-3s are also well-researched in their ability to prevent arrhythmias, in which the heart beats abnormally and erratically. Many, but not all, epidemiologic studies show an association with high fish intake and lower risk of heart failure and deaths from heart disease. The earliest epidemiologic research found a low incidence of CVD in the Inuit people in Greenland, attributed to their traditional high-fat diet consisting largely of seal, fish, and other marine animals. Other studies of coastal populations in Japan and Alaska also showed an inverse relationship of higher dietary omega-3s and lower rates of heart disease. [3]
Research showing a heart benefit with omega-3 supplements is less convincing, though sometimes very high doses of fish oil supplements are prescribed by a physician for the treatment of high triglycerides or thromboses (blood clots). The American Heart Association recommends including 1-2 seafood servings a week in the diet; supplements of 1,000 mg daily containing DHA/EPA are recommended only for people with existing heart disease, based on a potential benefit of lowering triglycerides and risk of arrhythmias and atherosclerosis. [5,6]¬†They do not recommend omega-3 supplements for people without CVD or risk factors for CVD.
Epidemiological studies show that lower intakes of omega-3s are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Fatty membranes of the brain are rich in DHA, which is associated with optimal functioning of the brain. Some studies show 30-50% lower DHA levels in the hippocampus region (the brain‚Äôs ‚Äúmemory bank‚Äù) in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. [8]Lower DHA levels are associated with amyloidosis, a buildup of protein deposits called amyloids, which is believed to progress Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. [9] Both DHA and EPA can also help regulate inflammation and elevated triglycerides, which are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. [8]
Most epidemiological studies show that fish intakes of greater than one serving per week are associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease pathology, particularly in adults ages 65 and older. [10,8]Higher fish intakes have also been associated with a larger volume of gray matter in the brain and a slower decline in memory scores (dementia is linked with decreased gray matter). [11] However, evidence is lacking to support the use of omega-3 supplements for the prevention or treatment of cognitive decline in later ages. [5]
Dietary omega-3s play a role in brain development and growth of the fetus during pregnancy and into infancy. DHA is also found in high amounts in the retina, which develops rapidly in the fetus during the last trimester. Cohort studies show that a higher intake of seafood containing DHA (about 8 ounces weekly) is associated with healthier infants. Research following a cohort of mothers and infants found that higher fish consumption during pregnancy (2+ servings fish weekly) compared with no fish intake was associated with higher cognitive scores in infants and young children 3-5 years old, though higher mercury intake was linked with lower scores. [12-13] However these effects lessened in older children; the researchers found in the same cohort that there was no benefit or harm on cognition in children 6-10 years old from an average maternal fish intake of about 1.5 servings weekly or mercury exposure during pregnancy. [14] Another review found that the benefits of eating moderate amounts of seafood during pregnancy outweighed potential risks from methylmercury exposure. [15] The 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that pregnant woman consume 8 ounces of low-mercury seafood per week, and children about 3 ounces of low-mercury seafood per week [16].
Research has also found that swapping red and processed meat with fish and seafood can lower the risk of diseases and premature death. One reason may be differences intypes of fat: mostly saturated fat in red meat versus unsaturated fat in seafood. Data from six U.S. cohort studies found that higher intakes of red meat and processed meat were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and early death, whereas fish was not. [17] Research from a large Danish cohort study found that replacing red and/or processed red meat with fish or poultry lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes and early death. [18-19]
Considerswapping out red meatin some recipes for seafood:
Certain species can carry small amounts of neurotoxic compounds like methylmercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). It is believed that these chemicals can delay brain development in infants and modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [5]Those most at-risk for these exposures are pregnant and nursing women, breast-fed infants, and young children.
As concerning as this sounds, it is important to weigh the risk versus benefit. A report from the FAO and WHO Expert Committee outlining the risks and benefits of fish consumption found that the benefits of dietary omega-3s outweighed the risks of mercury exposure in childbearing women. Eating fish during pregnancy lowered the risk of delayed fetal brain development compared with pregnant women who did not eat fish. [20,5] Studies have found dioxins and PCB levels in fish to be typically very low, and small exposures to these compounds in pregnant woman will not harm the fetus. Consider that more than 90% of the PCBs and dioxins in the U.S. food supply come not from aquatic foods but from land-based meats, dairy, eggs, and vegetables. There is also limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing an association with higher mercury intake (obtained mostly from aquatic foods) and increased cardiovascular disease. The small exposures to mercury may be offset by the several heart-protective nutrients found in fish and other aquatic species.
Those who eat aquatic foods very frequently (5 or more servings a week) and vulnerable populations (pregnant/nursing women, infants, and toddlers) may limit intake of species highest in mercury (swordfish, shark, bluefin tuna, yellowfin or ahi tuna, canned white albacore tuna, king mackerel, marlin, golden bass). Good choices are cod, catfish, shellfish, oysters, mussels, shrimp, sardines, and scallops; see the Food and Drug Administration guide for otherlow-mercury seafood. Also check local advisories on levels of contaminants in freshwater fish from lakes and reservoirs, as these types tend to be higher in mercury and PCBs. If no specific guidelines are available, consume up to 6 ounces a week of fish from local waters but limit eating any other aquatic foods during that week.
To minimize risk of harmful pathogens and parasites, cook and store aquatic foods to proper temperatures. See the Food and Drug Administration guidelineson selecting, storing, and serving seafood safely. Another potential risk are harmfulalga blooms, or red tides, that can create toxic substances in seafood leading to symptoms like diarrhea, shortness of breath, asthma attacks, and skin rashes. The best way to avoid these toxins is to purchase seafood from reputable suppliers that have high standards for quality and safety.
Modern production of aquatic foods can be split into two different sectors: wild capture and aquaculture. Wild capture production involves harvested wild fish and other aquatic species from the ocean and freshwater sources. Aquaculture is the practice of farming aquatic plants and animals.
In general, the production of any animal-based food tends to havehigher greenhouse gas emissions than the production of plant-based foods, with red meat (especially beef and lamb) standing out for its disproportionate impact. However, the production of aquatic foods (through both wild capture and aquaculture) not only produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and uses less land than red meat production, but many aquatic animal foods also have less environmental impact than poultry production. [21] That said, beyond emissions and land use, it is important to consider where and how aquatic foods are produced, since environmental as well as social and economic impacts can vary widely in both wild capture and aquaculture sectors. [1]
The percentage of wild marine fisheries classified as ‚Äúoverfished‚Äù has steadily increased over the past few decades. According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the fraction of fish stocks that are within ‚Äúbiologically sustainable‚Äù levels decreased from 90%¬† in 1974 to just under 66% in 2017. [2] Beyond the challenges that overfishing presents for food security and human health, commercial fishing at current scales can also contribute to:
Aquaculture is emerging to fill gaps in seafood supply from reductions in existing wild fish stocks. Today, aquaculture represents the world‚Äôs fastest growing food production industry, based largely in Asia (China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh), Europe (Norway), and increasingly in Africa (Egypt). Despite its promise, aquaculture must be done responsibly. For example, insufficiently regulated aquaculture can result in both environmental stressors‚Äîsuch as freshwater use and nitrogen and phosphorus emissions‚Äîas well as negative interactions with wild fishery populations through the spread of disease, overuse of antibiotics, escaped species. [21]
In summary, sustainably and equitably achieving the human health benefits of increased aquaculture production will require policies and technologies that minimize impacts on surrounding ecosystems, industries, and communities. [1]
Aquatic foods are a diverse category of nutrient-dense, protein-rich foods that can also be a healthful animal-based alternative when looking to cut down on red meat or other land-sourced animal foods. Misconceptions exist, such as having a strong off-putting odor (fresh fish should not smell!) or higher cost than other animal protein foods, which may deter people from choosing aquatic foods. However, many aquatic foods are a major source of omega-3 fatty acids and various nutrients that are helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, and that are vital for normal fetal development. They can also be delicious and satisfying, and incorporated into many meals like salads, stews, sandwiches, and main courses. Here are some recipes andideas for cooking with aquatic foods.

üîó Diet Review: Paleo Diet for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/paleo-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The Paleolithic or ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù diet seeks to address 21stcentury ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Our predecessors used simple stone tools that were not advanced enough to grow and cultivate plants, so they hunted, fished, and gathered wild plants for food. If they lived long enough, they were believed to experience less modern-day diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease because of a consistent diet of lean meats and plant foods along with a high level of physical activity from intensive hunting. However, the life expectancy of our predecessors was only a fraction of that of people today.
The popularity of the Paleo diet, which hit a peak in 2014, appealed to consumers‚Äô increasing desire to eat more healthfully and to know where their food was coming from. [1]
The Paleo diet, also referred to as the caveman or Stone-Age diet, includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Proponents of the diet emphasize choosinglow-glycemicfruits and vegetables. There is debate about several aspects of the Paleo diet: what foods actually existed at the time, the variation in diets depending on region (e.g., tropical vs. Arctic), how modern-day fruits and vegetables bear little resemblance to prehistoric wild versions, and disagreement among Paleo diet enthusiasts on what is included/excluded from the diet. Because of these differences, there is not one ‚Äútrue‚Äù Paleo diet.
For example, although white potatoes were recorded as being available during the Paleolithic era, they are usually avoided on the Paleo diet because of their high glycemic index. Processed foods are also technically off limits due to an emphasis on fresh foods, but some Paleo diets allow frozen fruits and vegetables because the freezing process preserves most nutrients.
Overall, the diet is high inprotein, moderate infat(mainly fromunsaturated fats), low-moderate incarbohydrate(specifically restricting highglycemic indexcarbohydrates), high infiber, and low in sodium and refined sugars. [2] The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (including the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA) come from marine fish, avocado, olive oil, and nuts and seeds.
Grass-fed beef is often highlighted on the diet, which is promoted to contain moreomega-3 fatsthan conventional beef (due to being fed grass instead of grain). It does contain small amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, only a small proportion of ALA can be converted in the body to long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). The amount of omega-3 is also highly variable depending on the exact feeding regimen and differences in fat metabolism among cattle breeds. [3] In general, the amount of omega-3 in grass-fed beef is much lower than that in oily marine fish. [3] Cooked salmon contains 1000-2000 mg of EPA/DHA per 3-ounce portion, whereas 3 ounces of grass-fed beef contains about 20-200 mg of ALA.
Some randomized controlled trials have shown the Paleo diet to produce greater short-term benefits than diets based on national nutrition guidelines, including greater weight loss, reduced waist circumference, decreased blood pressure, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cholesterol. However these studies were of short duration (6 months or less) with a small number of participants (less than 40). [4-6]
One larger randomized controlled trial followed 70 post-menopausal Swedish women with obesity for two years, who were placed on either a Paleo diet or a Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) diet. [7] The Paleo diet provided 30% of total calories from protein, 40% fat (from mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and 30% carbohydrates. It included lean meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, avocado, and olive oil. The NNR diet provided less protein and fat but more carbohydrate with 15% protein, 25-30% fat, and 55-60% carbohydrates, including foods similar to the Paleo diet but also low-fat dairy products and high-fiber grains. Both groups significantly decreased fat mass and weight circumference at 6 and 24 months, with the Paleo diet producing greater fat loss at 6 months but not at 24 months. Triglyceride levels decreased more significantly with the Paleo diet at 6 and 24 months than the NNR diet.
The Paleo diet includes nutrient-dense whole fresh foods and encourages participants to steer away from highly processed foods containing added salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. However, the omission of whole grains, dairy, and legumes could lead to suboptimal intake of important nutrients. The restrictive nature of the diet may also make it difficult for people to adhere to such a diet in the long run.¬† More high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year that compare the Paleo diet with other weight-reducing diets are needed to show a direct health benefit of the Paleo diet. Strong recommendations for the Paleo diet for weight loss cannot be made at this time.

üîó Fish: Friend or Foe?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/fish/

Fears of contaminants make many unnecessarily shy away from fish.
Fish is a very important part of a healthy diet. Fish and other seafood are the major sources of healthful long-chain omega-3 fats and are also rich in other nutrients such as vitamin D and selenium, high in protein, and low in saturated fat. There is strong evidence that eating fish or taking fish oil is good for the heart and blood vessels. An analysis of 20 studies involving hundreds of thousands of participants indicates that eating approximately one to two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish a week‚Äîsalmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, or sardines‚Äîreduces the risk of dying from heart disease by 36 percent. (1)
Eating fish fights heart disease in several ways. The omega-3 fats in fish protect the heart against the development of erratic and potentially deadly cardiac rhythm disturbances. They also lower blood pressure and heart rate, improve blood vessel function, and, at higher doses, lower triglycerides and may ease inflammation. The strong and consistent evidence for benefits is such that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the American Heart Association, and others suggest that everyone eat fish twice a week. (2,3)
Unfortunately, fewer than one in five Americans heeds that advice. About one-third of Americans eat seafood once a week, while nearly half eat fish only occasionally or not at all. (4) Although some people may simply not like fish, the generally low consumption is likely also caused by other factors, including perceptions about cost, access to stores that sell fish, and uncertainty about how to prepare or cook fish. Still others may avoid seafood because they worry that they‚Äîor their children‚Äîwill be harmed by mercury, pesticide residues, or other possible toxins that are in some types of fish.
Should you forgo fish because of the contaminants they might carry? It‚Äôs a controversial topic that is often fueled more by emotion than by fact. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs known about the benefits and risks of eating fish and other seafood:
Avoiding fish is certainly one way to avoid mercury or PCBs. But is that the wisest choice, given the benefits of eating fish? Drs. Mozaffarian and Rimm put this in perspective in their analysis in theJournal of the American Medical Association.(1) First, reviewing data from the Environmental Protection Agency and elsewhere, they calculated that if 100,000 people ate farmed salmon twice a week for 70 years, the extra PCB intake could potentially cause 24 extra deaths from cancer‚Äîbut would prevent at least 7,000 deaths from heart disease. Second, levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish are very low, similar to levels in meats, dairy products, and eggs. Third, more than 90 percent of the PCBs and dioxins in the U.S. food supply come from such non-seafood sources, including meats, dairy, eggs, and vegetables. So, given these limited health effects, low levels in fish, and major sources from other foods, the levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish should not influence your decision about which fish to eat (just as it does not influence your decision about whether or not to eat vegetables, meats, dairy products, or eggs, the major sources of PCBs and dioxins). One exception: if you eat local freshwater fish caught by friends or family, it makes sense to consult local advisories about the amounts of such fish you should eat.
Learn more about new study that finds no link betweenmercury exposure and heart disease, fromHarvard School of Public Health and Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital.
At the levels commonly consumed from fish, there is also limited and conflicting evidence for effects of mercury in adults; thus, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the Institutes of Medicine report, and the analysis by Mozaffarian and Rimm all conclude that this evidence is insufficient to recommend limitations on fish intake in adults, given the established benefits of fish consumption for cardiovascular disease. In fact, the easiest way to avoid concern about contaminants is simply to eat a variety of fish and other seafood.
Except perhaps for a few fish species, the scale tips in favor of fish consumption for women who are pregnant. High intake of mercury appears to hamper a baby‚Äôs brain development. (6) But low intake of omega-3 fats from fish is at least as dangerous. In a study of almost 12,000 pregnant women, children born to those who ate less than two servings of fish a week didn‚Äôt do as well on tests of intelligence, behavior, and development as children born to mothers who ate fish at least twice a week. (7) A study conducted by Harvard researchers showed that visual recognition scores in six-month-olds were highest in those whose mothers ate at least two servings of fish a week during pregnancy but who also had low mercury levels. (8) Several other observational studies of fish intake during pregnancy, and randomized controlled trials of fish oil during pregnancy or breast feeding, have found similar benefits of mothers‚Äô fish or fish oil intake for their babies‚Äô brain development.
So, women should recognize that avoiding seafood altogether is likely to harm their babies‚Äô brain development. The healthiest approach for women who are or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children is to eat two servings per week of fish or other seafood, including up to one serving per week of white (albacore) canned tuna, and avoid the four fish species higher in mercury (shark, swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel). It is important that women recognize that the list of fish and seafood that they should eat is far larger than the few specific species to be avoided. Here‚Äôs what the Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration recommend for women who are or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children:
Not all omega-3 fats come from fish. In fact, Americans also consume plant omega-3s in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in flax seeds, walnuts, and a few vegetable oils. In the human body, ALA is not converted to the marine omega-3s. EPA and DHA, to any large extent. So, the evidence does not support eating ALA as a replacement for seafood consumption. On the other hand, some data from observational studies like the Nurses‚Äô Health Study suggest that getting extra ALA may reduce the chances of cardiovascular disease. (9) Another analysis, from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, showed that higher intake of ALA may be particularly important for protection against heart disease in people who didn‚Äôt eat much fish. (10) Since these findings haven‚Äôt yet been replicated in randomized trials, the exact benefit of ALA is still a bit up in the air, but eating more foods rich in this good fat may also be good for health.

üîó Ask the Expert: Healthy Fats
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2012/06/21/ask-the-expert-healthy-fats/

We asked Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard School of Public Health and Amy Myrdal Miller, M.S., R.D. of The Culinary Institute of America to explain why it‚Äôs time to end the ‚Äúlow fat is best‚Äù myth‚Äîand to provide ideas for how to use healthy fats in the home kitchen.
1.Should I ditch a low-fat diet?
Walter Willett: If you‚Äôve been able to keep your weight, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose under good control while eating a low-fat diet, this type of diet may be working for you. But for many people, low-fat diets don‚Äôt work. In fact, dozens of studies have found that low-fat diets are no better for health than moderate-or high-fat diets‚Äîand for many people, they may be worse.
Low-fat diets are usually high in carbohydrates, often from rapidly-digested foods such as white flour, white rice, potatoes, sugary drinks, and refined snacks. Eating lots of these ‚Äúfast carbs‚Äù can cause quick, sharp spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, and over time can increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease. High-carbohydrate, low-fat diets also have a negative effect on the fats and cholesterol in our blood: They raise ‚Äúbad‚Äù blood fats (triglycerides) and they lower the ‚Äúgood‚Äù blood cholesterol (HDL), both of which can increase the risk of heart disease. These diets also tend to increase blood pressure.
For many people, low-fat diets are not satisfying. People finish a meal and within a few hours, they are hungry again, seeking more low-fat fixes for their hunger. This vicious cycle leads to weight gain and, in turn, to the conditions associated with excess weight (such as blood triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes).
2. Are ‚Äúfat free‚Äù foods healthy?
Amy Myrdal Miller: Some foods in their natural state contain little or no fat‚Äîfor example, most fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dried beans. And of course these are healthy choices. But processed foods billed as ‚Äúlow fat‚Äù and ‚Äúfat free‚Äù are often higher in salt, sugar, or starch than their full-fat counterparts, to make up for the flavor and texture that‚Äôs lost when food manufacturers slash fat. So they are not necessarily ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù choices. For example, low-fat and non-fat salad dressings are nearly always higher in sugar and salt.
3. Will eating fat make me get fat?
Willett: No, it‚Äôs a myth that eating specifically high-fat foods makes you fat. Eating or drinking more calories than you need from any source, whether it‚Äôs fat, carbohydrate, protein, or alcohol can lead to weight gain. Over the past 30 years in the U.S., the percentage of calories from fat has actually gone down, but obesity rates have skyrocketed. Sugary soft drinks don‚Äôt contain any fat‚Äîyet the billions of gallons of sugary beverages that Americans drink each year have been a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.
4. Can I lose weight on a low-fat diet?
Willett: It‚Äôs possible to lose weight on any diet. But carefully-conducted clinical trials find that following a low-fat diet doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to lose weight or keep it off. In fact, study volunteers who follow moderate- or high-fat diets lose just as much weight, and in some studies a bit more, as those who follow low-fat diets.
Calories are what count for weight loss, so it‚Äôs important to find a lower-calorie eating plan that you can follow‚Äîand a lower-calorie plan that‚Äôs good for lifelong health. Low-fat diets raise triglycerides and lower good cholesterol, so for many folks, they‚Äôre simply not the best choice for health. For some people, high intake of carbohydrates, particularly if they come from refined rather than whole grains, can make weight control more difficult.
5. Are all kinds of fat equally healthy?
Willett: Some types of fats are healthier than others. Unsaturated fat is the healthiest type of fat. Plant oils, such as olive, canola, corn, peanut and other nut oils; nuts, such as almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and pistachios; avocados; and fish, especially oily fish such as salmon and canned tuna, are excellent sources of unsaturated fat. Eating unsaturated fat in place of refined grains and sugar can improve blood cholesterol profiles and lower triglycerides, and in turn, lower the risk of heart disease.
It is essential to include a special kind of unsaturated fat, called omega-3 fats, in the diet; good sources include fish, walnuts, flax seeds, and canola oil. Keep in mind that omega-3 fats from marine sources, such as fish and shellfish, have much more powerful health benefits than omega-3 fats from plant sources, like walnuts and flax seeds. But omega-3 fats from plant sources still are a good choice, especially for people who don‚Äôt eat fish.
Saturated fat is less healthy, since it raises ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol in the blood. We can‚Äôt completely eliminate saturated fat from our diets, though, because foods that are rich in healthy fats also contain a little bit of saturated fat. The best strategy is to limit foods that are very high in saturated fat, such as butter, cheese, and red meat, and replace them with foods that are high in healthy fats, such as plant oils, nuts, and fish. An alternative approach is to just use a very small amount of full-fat cheese, butter, cream, or red meat in dishes that emphasize plant foods such as vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt replace foods that are high in saturated fat¬† with ‚Äúfast carbs‚Äù‚Äîfoods like white bread, white rice, potatoes, sugary drinks, and refined snacks‚Äîsince eating too many of these fast carbs is just as bad for your heart as eating too much saturated fat.
Trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil (oil that has been chemically processed to make it more shelf-stable) is especially bad for health. Eating just a small amount of trans fat on a regular basis raises the risk of heart disease. So it‚Äôs best to avoid trans fat altogether. Most of the trans fat in people‚Äôs diets comes from commercially prepared baked goods, margarines, snack foods, and processed foods.¬† Many food makers are cutting trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthier fats. Still, you‚Äôll need to scan Nutrition Facts labels to make sure that the food you eat is free of trans fats.
Keep in mind that most foods contain a mix of fats. The key to a healthy diet is to choose foods that are higher in unsaturated fat than saturated fat‚Äîand that do not contain any trans fat. When you cut foods like red meat and butter out of your diet, replace them with healthy plant oils, nuts, fish, vegetables, or whole grains‚Äîdon‚Äôt replace them with white bread, white rice, potatoes, or other refined carbohydrates.
6. How can I cut back on trans fats?
Willett: Many food manufacturers are already removing trans fats from their products and replacing them with healthy fats. Similarly, many restaurants are removing trans fat from their menu items, so this is a big help. But you still need to pay attention to nutrition labels, to make sure that the food you buy does not contain any trans fats. Labeling laws allow food makers to say that a product has ‚Äú0 grams trans fat‚Äù even if it contains up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving from partially hydrogenated oils. This may not sound like a lot of trans fat. But if you eat several servings a day of these foods, your trans fat intake can really add up. So to make sure that a food you are buying is truly trans fat free, check the Nutrition Facts Panel to make sure it has 0 grams of trans fat‚Äîand check the ingredients list to make sure it does not contain any partially hydrogenated oil.
7. Are coconut oil and palm oil healthy?
Willett: Coconut oil and palm oil are higher in saturated fat than other plant oils. They are less harmful than partially hydrogenated oil, which is high in trans fats. But they are less beneficial for the heart than plant oils that are rich in unsaturated fats ‚Äî olive, canola, sunflower, and other oils. Coconut oil increases good cholesterol, which may make it a good choice when cooking a dish that needs a little hard fat.

8. Is it okay to eat high-fat fried foods?
Willett: It‚Äôs okay to eat fried foods, as long they are prepared with frying oil that doesn‚Äôt have any trans fats. It‚Äôs also important to look at the types of foods being fried. In America, we eat lots of fried potatoes, which contain rapidly-digested starch, and it‚Äôs good to find an alternative. Fried foods are high in calories, and it is important to think about calories, because most of us need to keep our calories in check to avoid gaining weight. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to cut out fried foods‚Äîjust choose smaller portions.
Myrdal Miller: Sweet potatoes are a great alternative for frying. Or you could just try making a smaller portion of fried potatoes, or pairing fried potatoes with other vegetables. If you‚Äôre in a restaurant and watching your calories, try sharing a fried dish with a friend. Or you could try ordering a half-sized portion of fried food along with a small salad.
9. Do I need to watch my percentage of calories from fat?
Willett: No. When you cook or read nutrition labels, don‚Äôt fixate on fat percentages. As long as you use healthy fats, and your keep your portion sizes modest, it doesn‚Äôt matter if your dish or meal has 30 percent, 40 percent, or more of its calories from fat. The same is true for your overall diet: Don‚Äôt worry about the percentage of calories from fat. Focus on choosing foods with healthy fats.
10. What‚Äôs better than a low-fat diet?
Willett: Try following a healthy fat, healthy carb diet, using two nutrition tools from Harvard School of Public Health as your guide: TheHealthy Eating Plateand theHealthy Eating Pyramid. The Healthy Eating Plate offers a simple blueprint for a healthy meal: Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits, save a quarter of the plate for whole grains, and the rest for a healthy source of protein; the glass bottle to the left of the plate is your reminder to use healthy plant oils in cooking, on salads, and at the table. Think of the Healthy Eating Pyramid as your grocery shopping list: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and plant oils are in the base, and healthy proteins‚Äînuts, beans, fish, and chicken‚Äîare in the next tier, meaning that these foods should make it into your grocery cart every week. Refined carbohydrates and sugary drinks, as well as red meat and butter, are in the ‚Äúuse-sparingly‚Äù tip‚Äîso skip the soda and snack food aisle, the deli counter, and the steaks and chops at the butcher counter. You can download copies of theHealthy Eating PlateandHealthy Eating Pyramidfrom The Nutrition Source website.
11. Can you share any tips for cooking with healthy fats?
Myrdal Miller: Here‚Äôs a few ideas for how to use healthy fats in your kitchen:
12. How can I convince my family to eat healthy fats?
Recipes for Health: Nut-Based Sauces
Try these Mediterranean-inspired sauce recipes with vegetables, chicken, or fish:
Spanish Romesco Sauce(Red Pepper and Almond Sauce)Turkish Muhammara(Red Pepper and Walnut Sauce)Greek Skordalia(Almond, Bread and Garlic Sauce)Turkish Tarator(Walnut and Garlic Sauce)Italian Pesto alla Trapanese(Almond, Parsley, Basil, and Tomato Sauce)
Myrdal Miller: Introduce your family to the range of healthy foods and flavors from around the world that rely on healthy fat to deliver their great flavor. Think about the nut-based sauces of the Mediterranean that make other healthful foods, such as vegetables and fish, more appealing and flavorful. Share this article with your family members, so that they understand that the type of fat matters more than the amount of fat, and that low-fat cooking isn‚Äôt necessarily better for health. Tell them that you will cook with healthy fats, such as olive and canola oil, and you will serve foods that naturally contain healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts and fish. Promise to limit foods that are high in saturated fat‚Äîbutter, cheese, red meat. And tell them that you‚Äôll scan nutrition labels so that you can avoid foods with partially hydrogenated oil and keep your pantry and table trans-fat free.

üîó Copper
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/copper/

Copper is a naturally occurring metal found in soil, water, and rocks. Nutritionally, it is an essential trace mineral found in some foods and in supplements. It works to assist various enzymes that produce energy for the body, break down and absorb iron, and build red blood cells, collagen, connective tissue, and brain neurotransmitters. Copper also supports normal brain development and immune functions, and is a component of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that dismantles harmful oxygen ‚Äúfree radicals.‚Äù Copper is absorbed in the small intestine and found mainly in bones and muscle tissue.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 900 micrograms daily for men and women. Pregnancy and lactation in adults 19+ years requires 1,300 micrograms daily, with a slightly lower amount of 1,000 micrograms daily in younger ages 14-18 years.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for copper for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 10,000 micrograms daily.
Because dozens of enzymes use copper to perform metabolic processes throughout the body, it is believed that both an excess and deficiency of copper may interrupt these normal processes and a stable level is required for optimal health. The body is typically efficient at stabilizing copper levels (absorption increases if copper intake is low, and vice versa). [1] Abnormal copper levels result from genetic mutations, aging, or environmental influences that may predispose to conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. [2]
Copper can have ‚Äúpro-oxidant‚Äù effects that potentially cause stress and damage to cells. The muscles in the heart contain high concentrations of copper, and may be negatively affected by either a deficiency or toxicity of the mineral. [3] Both conditions have been associated with atherogenesis, the early build-up of plaque in heart arteries. [3,4] Some cohort studies show an association with higher self-reported intakes of copper and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, as well as increased risk ofheart diseasewith a copper deficiency. [3,5] Other cohort studies show an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in people with higher copper blood levels compared with lower levels, although it should be noted that the higher blood levels in these studies remained within a normal range. [4,6] Due to these mixed findings, more research is needed before making conclusions on the cardiovascular effect of copper.
Some research shows that those with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), but both low and high blood levels of copper have been reported in the brains of people with AD. [1] A meta-analysis showed that people with AD had higher serum copper levels than those without AD. [7] However, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not show that copper supplements given for 12 months improved cognition in participants with mild AD. [8] Additionally, observational prospective studies have not found that self-reported dietary and total copper intakes are associated with cognitive decline. [1] More research is needed to better understand if and how high or low levels of copper are associated with AD risk.
Copper may play a role incancerfor several reasons. It supports angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor, and activates enzymes and signaling proteins used by cancer cells. [9,10] An emerging area of research has focused on the role of copper in metastatic cancer cells (these are cells that break away from a primary tumor and spread to other areas in the body). [11] Levels of copper in these aggressive cells were found to be higher than in non-metastatic cancer cells. Intentionally depleting copper levels by blocking its bioavailability may reduce the energy these cells need to travel in the body. Chelation-based treatments that bind to and inactivate copper are being researched. [10]
Copper is found in highest amounts inprotein foodslike organ meats,shellfish,fish,nuts, and seeds as well aswhole grainsandchocolate. The absorption of copper in the body will increase if the diet contains less copper, and decrease if the body has enough copper.
A copper deficiency is rare in the U.S. among healthy people and occurs primarily in people with genetic disorders or malabsorption problems such as Crohn‚Äôs and celiac disease. A genetic condition called Menkes disease interferes with copper absorption, leading to severe deficiency that could become fatal without copper injections. Also, it is possible to create a copper deficiency by taking high doses ofzincsupplements that can block the absorption of copper in the small intestine.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals as the body is efficient at excreting excess copper. It has been seen with Wilson‚Äôs disease, a rare genetic condition, that prevents copper from exiting the body and therefore leading to high blood levels. Severe liver damage and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may occur. Although very rare, it is possible to consume excess copper if continuously storing and then serving boiling liquids from corroding copper or brass vessels.
Although copper is naturally found in water, excessive levels of copper in drinking water is usually caused by leaked copper from old, corroded household pipes and faucets. There is greater risk if water is stagnant from lack of use or using hot tap water (copper more easily dissolves at higher temperatures). In these cases, exposure to excess copper can be decreased by running cold tap water for several minutes before using. It is also advised to use only cold tap water for drinking and cooking, and to avoid drinking hot tap water.

üîó Thiamin ‚Äì Vitamin B1
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-b1/

Thiamin (thiamine), or vitamin B1, is a water-soluble vitamin found naturally in some foods, added to foods, and sold as a supplement. Thiamin plays a vital role in the growth and function of various cells. [1] Only small amounts are stored in the liver, so a daily intake of thiamin-rich foods is needed.
Although symptoms of thiamin deficiency were first recorded in ancient texts of Chinese medicine, the symptoms were not connected with diet until the late 19thcentury. In 1884, a Japanese physician noted very high rates of illness and death among Japanese sailors eating a limited diet of only rice for months while at sea. When given a more varied diet with whole grains, meats, beans, and vegetables, rates of illness and death nearly disappeared. Around the same time, two Dutch scientists observed that chickens fed white polished rice developed leg paralysis, whereas chickens fed brown unpolished rice did not. Their observations led to the discovery of thiamin present in the outer layers of rice that were removed with polishing. [2]
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for men ages 19 and older is 1.2 mg daily, and for women in the same age range 1.1 mg daily. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 1.4 mg daily.
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. There is no UL for thiamin due to a lack of reports showing negative effects from high thiamin intakes.
Because thiamin is involved in several basic cell functions and the breakdown of nutrients for energy, a deficiency can lead to various problems in the brain and heart that require a constant supply of energy.
A deficiency of thiamin can lead to abnormal motor functions in the heart. Congestive heart failure is a condition that prevents the heart from properly pumping blood to the rest of the body. The rate of thiamine deficiency in people with congestive heart failure ranges from 21%-98%. [3] It occurs particularly in the elderly, those with a poor nutritional intake, or with the use of high doses of diuretics. Some clinical trials have found that thiamin supplementation compared with a placebo can significantly improve heart function in people with heart failure. [3]
Research has shown that thiamin deficiency can lead to neurological problems such as cognitive decline. [4,5] One form of thiamin deficiency called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome exhibits mental status changes similar to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Animal studies suggest that a lack of thiamin may cause oxidative stress or the death of nerve cells, memory loss, formation of plaque, and reduced glucose metabolism, which are all risk factors for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Research in humans has been limited, so it is not yet clear if thiamin supplementation can help this condition.
Thiamin is found naturally in meats, fish, andwhole grains. It is also added to breads, cereals, and baby formulas.
A thiamin deficiency in the U.S. is rare, as most people meet the RDA through their diets. It can occur from a low intake of foods containing thiamin, decreased absorption in the gut, or increased losses in urine such as with alcohol abuse or certain medications like diuretics.
A more severe thiamin deficiency can lead to beriberi, which causes muscle loss and diminished feeling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Because beriberi impairs reflexes and motor function, it can eventually lead to deadly fluid build-up in the heart and lower limbs. Another result of serious thiamin deficiency often seen with alcohol abuse is Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome that may cause confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and peripheral neuropathy. Both types of deficiency are also seen with compromised gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease or bariatric surgery, or those with HIV/AIDs. Treatment is high- dose supplements or injections through a vein along with a balanced diet.
Symptoms appearing with mild to moderate deficiency:
It is unlikely to reach a toxic level of thiamin from food sources alone. In the setting of very high intakes, the body will absorb less of the nutrient and flush out any excess amount through the urine. There is no established toxic level of thiamin.

üîó Vitamin B12
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-b12/

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is naturally found in animal foods. It can also be added to foods or supplements. Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It is also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells.
Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes unbind vitamin B12 into its free form. From there, vitamin B12 combines with a protein called intrinsic factor so that it can be absorbed further down in the small intestine.
Supplements and fortified foods contain B12 in its free form, so they may be more easily absorbed. There is a variety of vitamin B12 supplements available. Although there are claims that certain forms‚Äîlike sublingual tablets or liquids placed under the tongue to be absorbed through the tissues of the mouth‚Äîhave better absorption than traditional tablets, studies have not shown an important difference. Vitamin B12 tablets are available in high dosages far above the recommended dietary allowance, but these high amounts are not necessarily the amount that will be absorbed because an adequate amount of intrinsic factor is also needed. In cases of severe vitamin B12 deficiency due to inadequate intrinsic factor (pernicious anemia), doctors may prescribe B12 injections in the muscle.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for men and women ages 14 years and older is 2.4 micrograms (mcg) daily. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 2.6 mcg and 2.8 mcg daily, respectively. [1]
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. No upper limit has been set for vitamin B12, as there is no established toxic level.¬†¬†However, some evidence suggests that supplements of 25 mcg per day or higher may increase the risk of bone fractures. [2]
Vitamin B12 is involved in the breakdown of a protein called homocysteine. High homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk ofheart diseaseand stroke as it may promote the formation of blood clots and excess free radical cells, and may impair normal blood vessel function. A lack of adequate vitamin B12 can increase homocysteine levels.
Although epidemiological studies have found that vitamin B12 supplementation can decrease homocysteine levels, they have not consistently shown a decreased risk of cardiovascular events in taking the vitamin. Therefore the American Heart Association does not advocate for the routine use of B vitamin supplements in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. [1]¬† However,¬† vitamin B12 supplements can be important for some individuals with genetic variants that lead to high homocysteine levels.
High homocysteine levels are linked with a higher incidence of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, dementia, and cognitive decline. Similar to cardiovascular disease, although the research has shown that vitamin B12 supplementation reduces homocysteine blood levels, this has not translated into reduced rates of cognitive decline. A Cochrane review onfolic acidsupplements and cognition, with or without vitamin B12, did not find a significant effect of the supplements vs. placebo on cognitive function in healthy elderly people or people with dementia. [3] Another review of 14 randomized controlled trials also did not consistent evidence of benefit with the use of vitamin B12 supplements, alone or with other B vitamin supplements, on cognitive function in people with either normal or impaired cognition. [4] These findings do not preclude a possible benefit among some individuals with low vitamin B12 levels, and more research is needed.
Food Sources
Measuring vitamin B12 in the blood is actually not the best way to determine whether someone is deficient, as some people with a deficiency can show normal B12 blood levels. Blood levels of methylmalonic acid, a protein breakdown product, and homocysteine are better markers that capture actual vitamin B12 activity. These values increase with a vitamin B12 deficiency. It is estimated that up to 15% of the general population has a vitamin B12 deficiency. [1]
Factors that may cause vitamin B12 deficiency:
Signs of deficiency may include:
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, so any unused amount will exit the body through the urine. Generally, up to 1000 mcg a day of an oral tablet to treat a deficiency is considered safe. The Institute of Medicine states ‚Äúno adverse effects have been associated with excess vitamin B12 intake from food and supplements in healthy individuals.‚Äù [1] However, it is important not to start a high-dosage supplement of any kind without first checking with your doctor.

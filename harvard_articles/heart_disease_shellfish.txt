üîó Manganese
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/manganese/

Manganese is a trace mineral that is essential to our bodies in small amounts. Because we cannot make it, we must obtain it in food or supplements. Manganese is a coenzyme that assists many enzymes involved in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and cholesterol. [1] It also assists enzymes in building bones and keeping theimmuneand reproductive systems running smoothly. [2] Manganese works withvitamin Kto assist in wound healing by clotting the blood.
Manganese is absorbed in the small intestine. Most of the mineral is stored in bone, with smaller amounts in the liver, brain, kidneys, and pancreas. Manganese levels are difficult to measure in the body as dietary intakes do not always correlate with blood levels.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 2.3 mg a day for men and 1.8 mg for women. For women who are pregnant or lactating, the RDA is 2.0 mg and 2.6 mg, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for manganese for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 11 mg daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Manganese plays a role in the metabolism ofcarbohydratesand specifically glucose. In animal studies, a manganese deficiency can impair the action of insulin and disrupt normal blood levels of glucose. However, human studies have shown mixed results on its connection with diabetes. [2] Case-control studies have shown an association of very high and very low blood levels of manganese and an increased risk oftype 2 diabetes. [3,4] Other studies have found no association at all. [5] Therefore, it is still unclear if higher manganese intakes or manganese supplementation may protect against type 2 diabetes.
Manganese assists enzymes that build bone. Animal studies show that a deficiency of the mineral can reduce bone density and the formation of bone. Human studies have been few and small in size, and have shown conflicting conclusions. [2] Some observational studies found lower blood levels of manganese in women with osteoporosis versus those without osteoporosis; other studies found no difference. There have been no clinical trials studying the effects of manganese supplementation on bone health.
Manganese is found in a wide variety of foods, from shellfish to grains to legumes, and even spices. Drinkingwatercontains small amounts of manganese.
A deficiency of manganese is very rare, and there are no groups of people known to be at risk for developing a deficiency. Therefore, symptoms showing a deficiency have not been clearly established. The absorption of manganese may decrease if eaten with iron-rich foods, as these minerals compete for the same proteins that help with their absorption in the intestines.
There are no reports of reaching toxic levels of manganese from the diet. However, there have been isolated case reports of toxicity shown in people who drank water contaminated with unusually high levels of manganese and in industrial mining and welding workers who inhaled excess amounts of manganese in dust. [2] Becauseironand manganese rely on the same proteins that help with their absorption, having low iron stores (e.g., anemia) can increase manganese absorption and heighten a toxicity if excess manganese is present.
A manganese toxicity targets the central nervous system. Symptoms include:

üîó Copper
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/copper/

Copper is a naturally occurring metal found in soil, water, and rocks. Nutritionally, it is an essential trace mineral found in some foods and in supplements. It works to assist various enzymes that produce energy for the body, break down and absorb iron, and build red blood cells, collagen, connective tissue, and brain neurotransmitters. Copper also supports normal brain development and immune functions, and is a component of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that dismantles harmful oxygen ‚Äúfree radicals.‚Äù Copper is absorbed in the small intestine and found mainly in bones and muscle tissue.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 900 micrograms daily for men and women. Pregnancy and lactation in adults 19+ years requires 1,300 micrograms daily, with a slightly lower amount of 1,000 micrograms daily in younger ages 14-18 years.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for copper for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 10,000 micrograms daily.
Because dozens of enzymes use copper to perform metabolic processes throughout the body, it is believed that both an excess and deficiency of copper may interrupt these normal processes and a stable level is required for optimal health. The body is typically efficient at stabilizing copper levels (absorption increases if copper intake is low, and vice versa). [1] Abnormal copper levels result from genetic mutations, aging, or environmental influences that may predispose to conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. [2]
Copper can have ‚Äúpro-oxidant‚Äù effects that potentially cause stress and damage to cells. The muscles in the heart contain high concentrations of copper, and may be negatively affected by either a deficiency or toxicity of the mineral. [3] Both conditions have been associated with atherogenesis, the early build-up of plaque in heart arteries. [3,4] Some cohort studies show an association with higher self-reported intakes of copper and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, as well as increased risk ofheart diseasewith a copper deficiency. [3,5] Other cohort studies show an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in people with higher copper blood levels compared with lower levels, although it should be noted that the higher blood levels in these studies remained within a normal range. [4,6] Due to these mixed findings, more research is needed before making conclusions on the cardiovascular effect of copper.
Some research shows that those with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), but both low and high blood levels of copper have been reported in the brains of people with AD. [1] A meta-analysis showed that people with AD had higher serum copper levels than those without AD. [7] However, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not show that copper supplements given for 12 months improved cognition in participants with mild AD. [8] Additionally, observational prospective studies have not found that self-reported dietary and total copper intakes are associated with cognitive decline. [1] More research is needed to better understand if and how high or low levels of copper are associated with AD risk.
Copper may play a role incancerfor several reasons. It supports angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor, and activates enzymes and signaling proteins used by cancer cells. [9,10] An emerging area of research has focused on the role of copper in metastatic cancer cells (these are cells that break away from a primary tumor and spread to other areas in the body). [11] Levels of copper in these aggressive cells were found to be higher than in non-metastatic cancer cells. Intentionally depleting copper levels by blocking its bioavailability may reduce the energy these cells need to travel in the body. Chelation-based treatments that bind to and inactivate copper are being researched. [10]
Copper is found in highest amounts inprotein foodslike organ meats,shellfish,fish,nuts, and seeds as well aswhole grainsandchocolate. The absorption of copper in the body will increase if the diet contains less copper, and decrease if the body has enough copper.
A copper deficiency is rare in the U.S. among healthy people and occurs primarily in people with genetic disorders or malabsorption problems such as Crohn‚Äôs and celiac disease. A genetic condition called Menkes disease interferes with copper absorption, leading to severe deficiency that could become fatal without copper injections. Also, it is possible to create a copper deficiency by taking high doses ofzincsupplements that can block the absorption of copper in the small intestine.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals as the body is efficient at excreting excess copper. It has been seen with Wilson‚Äôs disease, a rare genetic condition, that prevents copper from exiting the body and therefore leading to high blood levels. Severe liver damage and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may occur. Although very rare, it is possible to consume excess copper if continuously storing and then serving boiling liquids from corroding copper or brass vessels.
Although copper is naturally found in water, excessive levels of copper in drinking water is usually caused by leaked copper from old, corroded household pipes and faucets. There is greater risk if water is stagnant from lack of use or using hot tap water (copper more easily dissolves at higher temperatures). In these cases, exposure to excess copper can be decreased by running cold tap water for several minutes before using. It is also advised to use only cold tap water for drinking and cooking, and to avoid drinking hot tap water.

üîó Iodine
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/iodine/

Iodine is an essential trace mineral not made by the body so must be obtained by food or supplements. It is found naturally in some foods and is added to supplements and some salt seasonings. Iodine is needed to make the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which assist with the creation of proteins and enzyme activity, as well as regulating normal metabolism. Without enough iodine, these thyroid hormones do not work properly and can lead to an under-active or overactive thyroid gland, causing the medical conditions of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism with various negative side effects in the body.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for iodine is 150 micrograms (mcg) daily for adult men and women 19+ years, and 220 and 290 mcg daily for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. [1,2]
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. The UL for iodine for adults 19+ years and pregnant and lactating women is 1,100 mcg daily.
Production of thyroid hormones increases during pregnancy, requiring higher intakes of iodine. Both the fetus and infant require enough iodine for normal physical growth and brain development. Breast milk contains iodine, though the amount will depend on the mother‚Äôs diet, and many infant formulas contain iodine. However, not all prenatal multivitamins contain iodine. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that prenatal and lactating women take supplemental iodine by using iodized salt. [2] High-dose iodine supplements are not always advised, as they can cause thyroid problems in some women.
Moderate to severe iodine deficiency in children can cause a lower IQ and stunted growth. Iodine supplementation in these children appears to improve both their physical and mental development.
These conditions occur when the body produce too little (hypothyroidism) or too much (hyperthyroidism) thyroid hormone. An early sign of hypothyroidism is having an elevated blood level of of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This may occur with low intakes of iodine. It may also occur in people with a history of iodine deficiency who take high doses of iodine such as in supplements. [1] Goiter, a lump in the front of the neck from an enlarged inflamed thyroid gland, can result from hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or an excessive iodine intake (usually involves taking very high doses of more than 18,000 mcg a day for a prolonged time). [1] Relatedly,goitrogensin some cruciferous vegetables can prevent the absorption of iodine, which may then interfere with thyroid function and cause goiter. Those already with an iodine deficiency or hypothyroidism are most susceptible.
Iodine is found in soil and the ocean, which varies in amount and will affect how much of the mineral is contained in a food. Iodine is found mainly in animal protein foods and sea vegetables, and to a lesser extent in fortified foods like breads, cereals, and milk.
Iodine regulates metabolism, the conversion of energy obtained from food into energy to help cells function and grow. A deficiency of iodine can therefore prevent normal growth and development. This is especially dangerous in pregnant women and infants, in which miscarriage, stillbirth, stunted growth, and cognitive impairments (difficulties with reading, writing, talking, problem solving, social skills) can occur. In adults, an iodine deficiency of less than 10-20 mcg a day can lead to inadequate thyroid hormone production, called hypothyroidism, which disrupts normal metabolic functions like regulating heart rate, body temperature, and body weight. [2] A lump or swelling in the neck, called goiter, often accompanies hypothyroidism. Other signs of hypothyroidism include:
People at risk for iodine deficiency include those who do not use iodized salt or supplements containing iodine, pregnant women, vegans who do not eat any animal foods, and those living in areas with low levels of iodine in the soil (e.g., mountainous regions).
High iodine intakes are usually well-tolerated in most healthy people and do not cause problems. [1] This has been observed in countries such as Japan and Korea that eat iodine-rich seaweed regularly. [3] But some people with autoimmune thyroid disease or who have a history of chronic iodine deficiency can be sensitive to receiving extra iodine, inducing conditions of iodine deficiency like hypothyroidism and goiter. [2,4] Excess iodine can also lead to too much thyroid hormone production, causing hyperthyroidism; signs of this condition are an increased metabolism that promotes weight loss, fast or irregular heartbeat, hand tremors, irritability, fatigue, and sweatiness. Sometimes even just a slight increase in dietary iodine above the RDA can cause iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in sensitive individuals. [4]
Some epidemiologic studies have shown that high seaweed intakes are associated with an increased risk of certain types of thyroid cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, but the exact mechanism is unclear. [2,3]
Excess iodine intake may come from use of high-dose supplements or overeating certain seaweeds and salts that contain iodine. Severe iodine poisoning is rare, but symptoms include fever; stomach pain; nausea; vomiting; a burning sensation of the mouth, throat, and stomach; and even coma. [2] Children, infants, the elderly, and those with existing thyroid disease are particularly vulnerable to iodine toxicity and iodine-induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. [3,4]

üîó Aquatic Foods
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/aquatic-foods/

Foods like salmon, lobster, and shrimp, are often categorized as ‚Äúseafood.‚Äù But how might you classify these foods when including a freshwater fish, such as trout? Consider the termaquatic foods(also calledblue foods), which include any animals, plants, and microorganisms that originate in bodies of water. Examples are:
Aquatic foods can be farmed or wild-caught, and are sourced from inland waters like lakes, rivers, and wetlands; coastal areas like estuaries, mangroves, or near-shore; and marine or ocean waters. Despite currently being an important contribution to healthy diets for billions of people globally, aquatic foods are often undervalued nutritionally because their diversity tends to be restricted to protein or energy value, or framed as a monolithic category of ‚Äúseafood or fish.‚Äù [1]However, there is broad diversity of aquatic foods produced throughout the world and available during every season. Currently, wild fisheries harvest over 2,370 species and aquaculture growers farm approximately 624 species. [2]
Because aquatic foods are so nutrient rich, food technologists have innovated methods to create processed fish products, including fish powders for infants, fish wafers as a snack, and fish chutneys. [1]
This page will focus primarily on animal sources of aquatic foods rather than plant sources.
Certain aquatic animal foods are a major dietary source of two polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (PUFAs)‚Äîdocosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). These fatty acids are initially produced by certain types of algae, which are then eaten by aquatic animals so that the fats accumulate in their tissues or organs. Omega-3s are found in all aquatic foods, but particularly in the fatty tissue of oily fish like salmon and mackerel, the liver of lean white fish like cod and halibut, and the blubber or thick layer of fat under the skin of marine animals like seals and whales. Smaller amounts are also found in crustaceans, bivalves, and cephalopods. [3]Supplements of fish oil, algal oil, and krill oil also contain DHA and/or EPA. Much of the research on aquatic foods and human health focuses on these omega-3s.
Seafood intake is associated with reduced inflammation and blood pressure, and is protective from stroke and other cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Eating just 1-2 servings of fish weekly reduces the risk of death from heart disease by 36%. [3] This is not solely due to the omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA, but to other components in seafood, such as vitamins B6 and B12 that maintain normal levels ofhomocysteine. [4] Omega-3s are also well-researched in their ability to prevent arrhythmias, in which the heart beats abnormally and erratically. Many, but not all, epidemiologic studies show an association with high fish intake and lower risk of heart failure and deaths from heart disease. The earliest epidemiologic research found a low incidence of CVD in the Inuit people in Greenland, attributed to their traditional high-fat diet consisting largely of seal, fish, and other marine animals. Other studies of coastal populations in Japan and Alaska also showed an inverse relationship of higher dietary omega-3s and lower rates of heart disease. [3]
Research showing a heart benefit with omega-3 supplements is less convincing, though sometimes very high doses of fish oil supplements are prescribed by a physician for the treatment of high triglycerides or thromboses (blood clots). The American Heart Association recommends including 1-2 seafood servings a week in the diet; supplements of 1,000 mg daily containing DHA/EPA are recommended only for people with existing heart disease, based on a potential benefit of lowering triglycerides and risk of arrhythmias and atherosclerosis. [5,6]¬†They do not recommend omega-3 supplements for people without CVD or risk factors for CVD.
Epidemiological studies show that lower intakes of omega-3s are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Fatty membranes of the brain are rich in DHA, which is associated with optimal functioning of the brain. Some studies show 30-50% lower DHA levels in the hippocampus region (the brain‚Äôs ‚Äúmemory bank‚Äù) in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. [8]Lower DHA levels are associated with amyloidosis, a buildup of protein deposits called amyloids, which is believed to progress Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. [9] Both DHA and EPA can also help regulate inflammation and elevated triglycerides, which are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. [8]
Most epidemiological studies show that fish intakes of greater than one serving per week are associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease pathology, particularly in adults ages 65 and older. [10,8]Higher fish intakes have also been associated with a larger volume of gray matter in the brain and a slower decline in memory scores (dementia is linked with decreased gray matter). [11] However, evidence is lacking to support the use of omega-3 supplements for the prevention or treatment of cognitive decline in later ages. [5]
Dietary omega-3s play a role in brain development and growth of the fetus during pregnancy and into infancy. DHA is also found in high amounts in the retina, which develops rapidly in the fetus during the last trimester. Cohort studies show that a higher intake of seafood containing DHA (about 8 ounces weekly) is associated with healthier infants. Research following a cohort of mothers and infants found that higher fish consumption during pregnancy (2+ servings fish weekly) compared with no fish intake was associated with higher cognitive scores in infants and young children 3-5 years old, though higher mercury intake was linked with lower scores. [12-13] However these effects lessened in older children; the researchers found in the same cohort that there was no benefit or harm on cognition in children 6-10 years old from an average maternal fish intake of about 1.5 servings weekly or mercury exposure during pregnancy. [14] Another review found that the benefits of eating moderate amounts of seafood during pregnancy outweighed potential risks from methylmercury exposure. [15] The 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that pregnant woman consume 8 ounces of low-mercury seafood per week, and children about 3 ounces of low-mercury seafood per week [16].
Research has also found that swapping red and processed meat with fish and seafood can lower the risk of diseases and premature death. One reason may be differences intypes of fat: mostly saturated fat in red meat versus unsaturated fat in seafood. Data from six U.S. cohort studies found that higher intakes of red meat and processed meat were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and early death, whereas fish was not. [17] Research from a large Danish cohort study found that replacing red and/or processed red meat with fish or poultry lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes and early death. [18-19]
Considerswapping out red meatin some recipes for seafood:
Certain species can carry small amounts of neurotoxic compounds like methylmercury, dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). It is believed that these chemicals can delay brain development in infants and modestly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [5]Those most at-risk for these exposures are pregnant and nursing women, breast-fed infants, and young children.
As concerning as this sounds, it is important to weigh the risk versus benefit. A report from the FAO and WHO Expert Committee outlining the risks and benefits of fish consumption found that the benefits of dietary omega-3s outweighed the risks of mercury exposure in childbearing women. Eating fish during pregnancy lowered the risk of delayed fetal brain development compared with pregnant women who did not eat fish. [20,5] Studies have found dioxins and PCB levels in fish to be typically very low, and small exposures to these compounds in pregnant woman will not harm the fetus. Consider that more than 90% of the PCBs and dioxins in the U.S. food supply come not from aquatic foods but from land-based meats, dairy, eggs, and vegetables. There is also limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing an association with higher mercury intake (obtained mostly from aquatic foods) and increased cardiovascular disease. The small exposures to mercury may be offset by the several heart-protective nutrients found in fish and other aquatic species.
Those who eat aquatic foods very frequently (5 or more servings a week) and vulnerable populations (pregnant/nursing women, infants, and toddlers) may limit intake of species highest in mercury (swordfish, shark, bluefin tuna, yellowfin or ahi tuna, canned white albacore tuna, king mackerel, marlin, golden bass). Good choices are cod, catfish, shellfish, oysters, mussels, shrimp, sardines, and scallops; see the Food and Drug Administration guide for otherlow-mercury seafood. Also check local advisories on levels of contaminants in freshwater fish from lakes and reservoirs, as these types tend to be higher in mercury and PCBs. If no specific guidelines are available, consume up to 6 ounces a week of fish from local waters but limit eating any other aquatic foods during that week.
To minimize risk of harmful pathogens and parasites, cook and store aquatic foods to proper temperatures. See the Food and Drug Administration guidelineson selecting, storing, and serving seafood safely. Another potential risk are harmfulalga blooms, or red tides, that can create toxic substances in seafood leading to symptoms like diarrhea, shortness of breath, asthma attacks, and skin rashes. The best way to avoid these toxins is to purchase seafood from reputable suppliers that have high standards for quality and safety.
Modern production of aquatic foods can be split into two different sectors: wild capture and aquaculture. Wild capture production involves harvested wild fish and other aquatic species from the ocean and freshwater sources. Aquaculture is the practice of farming aquatic plants and animals.
In general, the production of any animal-based food tends to havehigher greenhouse gas emissions than the production of plant-based foods, with red meat (especially beef and lamb) standing out for its disproportionate impact. However, the production of aquatic foods (through both wild capture and aquaculture) not only produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and uses less land than red meat production, but many aquatic animal foods also have less environmental impact than poultry production. [21] That said, beyond emissions and land use, it is important to consider where and how aquatic foods are produced, since environmental as well as social and economic impacts can vary widely in both wild capture and aquaculture sectors. [1]
The percentage of wild marine fisheries classified as ‚Äúoverfished‚Äù has steadily increased over the past few decades. According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the fraction of fish stocks that are within ‚Äúbiologically sustainable‚Äù levels decreased from 90%¬† in 1974 to just under 66% in 2017. [2] Beyond the challenges that overfishing presents for food security and human health, commercial fishing at current scales can also contribute to:
Aquaculture is emerging to fill gaps in seafood supply from reductions in existing wild fish stocks. Today, aquaculture represents the world‚Äôs fastest growing food production industry, based largely in Asia (China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh), Europe (Norway), and increasingly in Africa (Egypt). Despite its promise, aquaculture must be done responsibly. For example, insufficiently regulated aquaculture can result in both environmental stressors‚Äîsuch as freshwater use and nitrogen and phosphorus emissions‚Äîas well as negative interactions with wild fishery populations through the spread of disease, overuse of antibiotics, escaped species. [21]
In summary, sustainably and equitably achieving the human health benefits of increased aquaculture production will require policies and technologies that minimize impacts on surrounding ecosystems, industries, and communities. [1]
Aquatic foods are a diverse category of nutrient-dense, protein-rich foods that can also be a healthful animal-based alternative when looking to cut down on red meat or other land-sourced animal foods. Misconceptions exist, such as having a strong off-putting odor (fresh fish should not smell!) or higher cost than other animal protein foods, which may deter people from choosing aquatic foods. However, many aquatic foods are a major source of omega-3 fatty acids and various nutrients that are helpful in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, and that are vital for normal fetal development. They can also be delicious and satisfying, and incorporated into many meals like salads, stews, sandwiches, and main courses. Here are some recipes andideas for cooking with aquatic foods.

üîó Understanding Food Labels
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-label-guide/

The information on food labels is intended to help consumers become savvy about their food choices. The front, back, and sides of a package are filled with information to inform us what the food contains and to provide guidance in making healthier selections of processed foods. However, all the numbers, percentages, and sometimes complex-sounding ingredients can lead to more confusion than clarity.
This guide will help you to navigate the terminology and nutrition information on a food package to ensure that you know what you‚Äôre buying.
The Nutrition Facts label is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was first mandated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 to help consumers make quick, informed food choices. It has undergone revisions, with thelatest update released in 2016. Changes are generally based on updated scientific information and input from the public regarding ease of use.
The percent Daily Value (%DV) shows how much of a nutrient in one serving of food contributes to one‚Äôs approximate daily requirement for the nutrient. To best use the %DV, remember these simple guidelines:
For more commentary on the updated Nutrition Facts label by Harvard nutrition experts, see the article,Updated Nutrition Facts Panel makes significant progress with ‚Äúadded sugars,‚Äù but there is room for improvement.
This is the section of a food label consumers see first, which within seconds can influence their purchase. This has made it a battleground between public health advocates and food manufacturers. Food manufacturers can choose to display FOP symbols or graphics that highlight nutritional aspects of the product if they are favorable to health, such as being lower in calories or added sugar, but may leave out less favorable information such as being high in sodium or saturated fat. These graphics promote a perception of healthfulness, which can be misleading if consumers rely only on these images without reading the Nutrition Facts panel for complete information. The FDA does not closely monitor these FOP graphics. Because research has shown that ‚Äúpositive‚Äù FOP labels like health stamps or checkmarks can overrate a food‚Äôs healthfulness, public health advocates have supported initiatives for FOP ‚Äúwarning‚Äù labels (e.g., traffic lights or stop signs) to highlight nutrients that are harmful to health in excess, such as sugars and fats insweetened beveragesandultra-processed snacks. All FOP labels in the U.S. are voluntary, which allows food manufacturers to highlight or hide the nutrition information they choose to help promote or preserve sales. If warning labels became mandatory, as public health advocates propose, the pressure on manufacturers would increase to change certain products to improve their nutritional quality.
These are statements reviewed by the FDA and supported by scientific evidence that suggest certain foods or diets may lower the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 regulates these health claims, which must undergo review by the FDA through a petition process. The FDA has approved12 health claimson food labels such as the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and hypertension; fiber-containing grains, fruits and vegetables and cancer; and folic acid and neural tube defects. However, just because a food contains a specific nutrient that is associated with a decreased risk of disease does not necessarily make the food healthy as a whole. An example would be a breakfast cereal high in soluble fiber for heart health but that is also high in added sugars. Research finds that consumers believe that a food carrying a health claim is healthier than a product that does not.
These statements describe the nutrients in a food beyond what is listed on the Nutrition Facts label, intended to showcase a health benefit of the food. An example is ‚ÄúContains 100% Vitamin C.‚Äù Most terms like ‚Äúlow sodium,‚Äù ‚Äúhigh fiber,‚Äù ‚Äúreduced fat,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood source of‚Äù are regulated by the FDA, and the nutrient amounts must meetspecific guidelinesto make these claims. Also regulated are comparative terms like ‚Äúless sugar‚Äù or ‚Äúfewer calories‚Äù comparing two similar products. However, these statements can mislead consumers about their overall healthfulness. For example, a bag of potato chips may advertise that it has 40% less fat and is cholesterol-free, suggesting it is a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food, when in reality even a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù potato chip is still a high-calorie ultra-processed food offering little nutrition. Some terms are not yet regulated by the FDA such as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or ‚Äúmultigrain.‚Äù As another example, see the pros and cons of health labeling forWhole Grains.
Chile implemented the Law of Food Labeling and Advertising in 2016, comprised of mandatory front-of-package (FOP) warning labels, restrictions on child-directed marketing, and the banning of sales in schools of all foods and beverages containing added sugars, sodium, or saturated fats that exceeded set nutrient or calorie thresholds. [1] The FOP labels displayed a black stop sign that used warning words of ‚Äúhigh in‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories. Later analyses found that purchases of sweetened beverages significantly declined following the implementation of this multifaceted law that was more effective than prior single initiatives (i.e., sweetened beverages tax).
Opposition by food industries in other countries is strong toward warning labels such as these. [2] In the United States, in 2011 the FDA recommended a FOP graphic of stars or checkmarks that indicated a less healthful versus healthful food choice. [3] In response, the Grocery Manufacturers Association intercepted this project by introducing the FOP label ‚ÄúFacts Up Front,‚Äù which displays certain nutrient amounts of a processed food. There was criticism due to its voluntary nature so that manufacturers of less healthful foods could simply choose not to display it. Opposers also noted that simply listing the nutrient amounts would not necessarily help a consumer to know if it was a healthful choice if they were unsure what the amounts meant (as opposed to the FDA‚Äôs stars and checks system that provided straightforward guidance on a healthful versus less healthful choice). Regardless, soon after initiation of the Facts Up Front label, the FDA discontinued their labeling project while continuing to monitor the Facts Up Front system.
The FDA oversees the ingredients listed on food labels. A packaged food must list the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. In other words, the ingredients that weigh the most are listed first. The list may contain unfamiliar terms alongside the common ingredient names. These may be added preservatives or colors (e.g., sodium bisulfite, caramel color), thickeners or emulsifiers (e.g., guar gum, carrageenan), or the scientific names of vitamins and minerals (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol). Ingredients like added sugars may carry many alternative names but are essentially varying combinations of fructose and glucose: evaporated cane juice, high fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and turbinado sugar.
Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, eight major food allergens‚Äîmilk, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, wheat, eggs, and soybeans‚Äîare required to be listed in a ‚Äúcontains‚Äù statement near the Ingredients list if present in a food. An example would be ‚Äúcontains wheat, milk, and soy.‚Äù Advisory statements addressing cross-contamination may also be listed such as ‚Äúmay contain wheat‚Äù or ‚Äúproduced in a facility that also uses peanuts.‚Äù On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act became law, declaring sesame as the 9th major food allergen recognized in the US. Sesame will be a required allergen listing as of January 1, 2023.
Other potential allergens include gluten and color additives such as FD&C Yellow No. 5. The FDA mandates that a product containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 must identify it on the food label. The term ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù can be listed on a label if it meets a specific maximum amount of gluten as defined by the FDA.
These dates found on food products inform both the seller and consumer about the shelf-life and optimal quality of the product. They are determined by the food manufacturer‚Äôs judgment for peak quality. Foods can still be eaten safely after these dates, with the exact amount of time dependent on the food product, but the flavor and texture may begin to deteriorate. These expiration dates are not required by federal law though some states may institute their own requirements.

üîó Selenium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/selenium/

Selenium is a trace mineral, which means that the body only needs a small amount of it. It is found naturally in foods or as a supplement. Selenium is an essential component of various enzymes and proteins, called selenoproteins, that help to make DNA and protect against cell damage and infections; these proteins are also involved in reproduction and the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Most selenium in the body is stored in muscle tissue, although the thyroid gland holds the highest concentration of selenium due to various selenoproteins that assist with thyroid function.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years of age is 55 micrograms daily. Women who are pregnant and lactating need about 60 and 70 micrograms daily, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for selenium for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 400 micrograms daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Selenium is a component of selenoproteins and enzymes. These have antioxidant properties that help to break down peroxides, which can damage tissues and DNA, leading to inflammation and other health problems.
A Cochrane review of 13 prospective observational studies showed a 31% reduced risk of cancer and 45% reduced risk of deaths from cancer in the groups with the highest selenium intakes or blood levels compared with the lowest selenium levels, particularly in men. [1] Yet, the authors cautioned about weaknesses in the meta-analysis since there were differences among the study populations and possible inaccuracy when assessing dietary selenium (regional differences in the selenium content of food was not accounted for).
Another Cochrane review of 83 randomized placebo-controlled trials did not find that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer type. In addition, some of the trials noted a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes with long-term use of selenium supplements (about 7 years) who had normal selenium blood levels at the start the of study. Further research is needed to replicate this finding. [2]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and cancer before making specific dietary recommendations.
There are high concentrations of selenium in the thyroid gland, where there are several selenium-containing enzymes regulating thyroid function. If the body does not have enough selenium, it can lead to autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto‚Äôs disease and Graves‚Äô disease. Both of these conditions cause the body to create antibodies that attack the thyroid gland, leading to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
Randomized controlled trials studying selenium supplementation show mixed results. Supplements have not been shown to significantly affect thyroid function in people with normal thyroid or mild hypothyroidism, despite causing increased blood levels of selenium. [3,4] Other studies have shown selenium to decrease the amount of these antibodies and promote the activity of selenoproteins, which work to decrease inflammation. [5]
The role of selenium supplementations for people with autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is still unclear. ¬†A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine controlled trials did not find that selenium supplements changed thyroid hormone function in people with ATD, nor did a Cochrane review. [6]
Selenoproteins help to protect cell membranes from damage by free radicals and keep blood platelets from becoming sticky, both of which can lead to heart disease. However, both cohort studies and clinical trials have shown mixed results regarding the relationship of selenium andcardiovascular disease (CVD).
Observational studies have shown that people with both low and high selenium exposure (based on dietary intake and blood levels) have an increased risk of CVD. Others have found no association at all. [7] Clinical trials have not found that selenium supplements reduce the risk of CVD or cardiac death; however these trials were small and included people who were not likely selenium deficient at the start of the study. [7]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and CVD before making specific dietary recommendations.
The amount of selenium in foods can vary widely depending on the selenium content of the soil in which it is grown. Soil content varies widely by region. Plant foods obtain selenium from soil, which will then affect the amount of selenium in animals eating those plants.Protein foodsfrom animals are generally good sources of selenium. Seafood, organ meats, and Brazil nuts are the foods highest in selenium although Americans obtain most of their selenium from everyday staples, like breads, cereals, poultry, red meat, andeggs.
A deficiency of selenium in the U.S. is rare as the soil throughout North America is generally rich in selenium. [7] Even if people live in areas with lower-selenium soil, the transport of food across the region as well as the use of fortified foods and supplements reduce the risk of deficiency.
Two conditions are associated with severe selenium deficiency: 1) Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy, or disease of heart muscle, and 2) Kashin-Beck disease, a form of osteoarthritis.
Symptoms:
Groups at risk for deficiency:
Chronically high intakes of selenium can lead to health problems, ranging from muscle tremors, hair loss, stomach upset, and lightheadedness, to more severe outcomes of heart attack, respiratory distress, or kidney failure. Brazil nuts are exceptionally high in selenium even when grown in low-selenium soil, with even one nut containing more than the RDA. Eating too many of these nuts on a daily basis can reach a toxic level, as well as using supplements that contain selenium in excess of the RDA.

üîó Zinc
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/zinc/

Zinc is a trace mineral, meaning that the body only needs small amounts, and yet it is necessary for almost 100 enzymes to carry out vital chemical reactions. It is a major player in the creation of DNA, growth of cells, building proteins, healing damaged tissue, and supporting a healthyimmune system. [1] Because it helps cells to grow and multiply, adequate zinc is required during times of rapid growth, such as childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy. Zinc is also involved with the senses of taste and smell.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 11 mg a day for men and 8 mg for women. Pregnancy and lactation requires slightly more at 11 mg and 12 mg, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for zinc is 40 mg daily for all males and females ages 19+ years.
Because zinc supports the growth and normal functioning of immune cells, even a mild or moderate deficiency can slow down the activity of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages that protect the body from viruses and bacteria. Zinc deficiency is a common health problem in children from low and middle-income countries that contributes to stunting of growth, diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria. [2] The elderly who may have low zinc intakes from a poor appetite due to multiple diseases and medications are at risk for infections, such as pneumonia and skin ulcers, as reviewed in the next section.
Adequate zinc is needed to create new cells, particularly collagen and fiber-like tissues, a necessary function in repairing damaged cells. Zinc also supports immune cell activity that combats inflammation from a wound. Therefore the greatest benefit of zinc appears to be in people who are deficient in the mineral and who have severe wounds such as decubitus ulcers or extensive burns. Because people with these conditions have higher zinc needs and may have poor appetites, supplements or topical creams are used rather than relying on food intake alone. In these cases, zinc is often combined with other nutrients like protein, vitamin C, and L-arginine that also promote wound healing such as in a nutritional shake. [3] However, a benefit of zinc supplementation has not been shown in people with skin ulcers who have normal blood levels of zinc. [4]
Meats, poultry, and seafood are rich in zinc. Some plant foods like legumes and whole grains are also good sources of zinc, but they also containphytatesthat can bind to the mineral, lowering its absorption.
Zinc is available in supplement form as pills and lozenges. Excess zinc can interfere with the absorption ofironand copper. High doses can also cause nausea and even vomiting. Therefore it is important not to take supplemental zinc unless it is known that the diet is low in foods containing zinc or a zinc deficiency is confirmed. A registered dietitian can help to evaluate one‚Äôs diet and determine if zinc intake is low.
Zinc is believed to prevent cold viruses from spreading and by reducing inflammation, which may shorten the duration of a cold. Research has shown mixed results of their effectiveness due to differences in the form of zinc, the dosage, and how long it was used. Yet some clinical trials support its effectiveness. A Cochrane review of clinical trials found that zinc lozenges did not prevent colds, but if taken within a day of the onset of cold symptoms (sore throat, sniffles), the lozenges could tame its severity. [5] However, it is noted that some of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies who may have had financial interest in or produced zinc lozenges.
Zinc lozenges can carry a few unpleasant side effects like having a metallic flavor and causing nausea, but some people would gladly trade these symptoms for a bout with a nasty cold.
A zinc deficiency is rare and is seen most commonly in people who do not absorb zinc well due to digestive disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases or who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery. Those with chronic liver or kidney disease are also at risk. Excessive or prolonged diarrhea can lead to a zinc deficiency, as well as severe conditions with increased zinc needs like burns and sepsis (an infection caused by harmful bacteria entering the blood). Zinc is more efficiently absorbed when taken in smaller doses and in people who are deficient in the mineral.
Other groups at risk for zinc deficiency:
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity occurs almost exclusively from zinc supplements rather than food. There have been no reports of eating too much zinc from the diet alone. [1]
Signs of toxicity include:
Zinc oxide was used in ointments to treat wounds, as noted in ancient Greek medical texts. Today, zinc oxide is still a popular over-the-counter treatment skin treatment. It can defend against sunburns by reflecting and scattering ultraviolet rays so they do not penetrate the skin. It is also used to treat inflamed skin conditions like burns, eczema, bedsores, and diaper rash. The compound forms a protective barrier on the skin‚Äôs surface, repelling away moisture and allowing the skin to heal. It may also aid enzymes to break down damagedcollagentissue so that new tissue can be formed. No negative side effects have been reported.

üîó Thiamin ‚Äì Vitamin B1
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-b1/

Thiamin (thiamine), or vitamin B1, is a water-soluble vitamin found naturally in some foods, added to foods, and sold as a supplement. Thiamin plays a vital role in the growth and function of various cells. [1] Only small amounts are stored in the liver, so a daily intake of thiamin-rich foods is needed.
Although symptoms of thiamin deficiency were first recorded in ancient texts of Chinese medicine, the symptoms were not connected with diet until the late 19thcentury. In 1884, a Japanese physician noted very high rates of illness and death among Japanese sailors eating a limited diet of only rice for months while at sea. When given a more varied diet with whole grains, meats, beans, and vegetables, rates of illness and death nearly disappeared. Around the same time, two Dutch scientists observed that chickens fed white polished rice developed leg paralysis, whereas chickens fed brown unpolished rice did not. Their observations led to the discovery of thiamin present in the outer layers of rice that were removed with polishing. [2]
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for men ages 19 and older is 1.2 mg daily, and for women in the same age range 1.1 mg daily. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 1.4 mg daily.
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. There is no UL for thiamin due to a lack of reports showing negative effects from high thiamin intakes.
Because thiamin is involved in several basic cell functions and the breakdown of nutrients for energy, a deficiency can lead to various problems in the brain and heart that require a constant supply of energy.
A deficiency of thiamin can lead to abnormal motor functions in the heart. Congestive heart failure is a condition that prevents the heart from properly pumping blood to the rest of the body. The rate of thiamine deficiency in people with congestive heart failure ranges from 21%-98%. [3] It occurs particularly in the elderly, those with a poor nutritional intake, or with the use of high doses of diuretics. Some clinical trials have found that thiamin supplementation compared with a placebo can significantly improve heart function in people with heart failure. [3]
Research has shown that thiamin deficiency can lead to neurological problems such as cognitive decline. [4,5] One form of thiamin deficiency called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome exhibits mental status changes similar to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Animal studies suggest that a lack of thiamin may cause oxidative stress or the death of nerve cells, memory loss, formation of plaque, and reduced glucose metabolism, which are all risk factors for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Research in humans has been limited, so it is not yet clear if thiamin supplementation can help this condition.
Thiamin is found naturally in meats, fish, andwhole grains. It is also added to breads, cereals, and baby formulas.
A thiamin deficiency in the U.S. is rare, as most people meet the RDA through their diets. It can occur from a low intake of foods containing thiamin, decreased absorption in the gut, or increased losses in urine such as with alcohol abuse or certain medications like diuretics.
A more severe thiamin deficiency can lead to beriberi, which causes muscle loss and diminished feeling in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Because beriberi impairs reflexes and motor function, it can eventually lead to deadly fluid build-up in the heart and lower limbs. Another result of serious thiamin deficiency often seen with alcohol abuse is Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome that may cause confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and peripheral neuropathy. Both types of deficiency are also seen with compromised gastrointestinal conditions such as celiac disease or bariatric surgery, or those with HIV/AIDs. Treatment is high- dose supplements or injections through a vein along with a balanced diet.
Symptoms appearing with mild to moderate deficiency:
It is unlikely to reach a toxic level of thiamin from food sources alone. In the setting of very high intakes, the body will absorb less of the nutrient and flush out any excess amount through the urine. There is no established toxic level of thiamin.

üîó Vitamin B12
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-b12/

Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, is naturally found in animal foods. It can also be added to foods or supplements. Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It is also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells.
Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes unbind vitamin B12 into its free form. From there, vitamin B12 combines with a protein called intrinsic factor so that it can be absorbed further down in the small intestine.
Supplements and fortified foods contain B12 in its free form, so they may be more easily absorbed. There is a variety of vitamin B12 supplements available. Although there are claims that certain forms‚Äîlike sublingual tablets or liquids placed under the tongue to be absorbed through the tissues of the mouth‚Äîhave better absorption than traditional tablets, studies have not shown an important difference. Vitamin B12 tablets are available in high dosages far above the recommended dietary allowance, but these high amounts are not necessarily the amount that will be absorbed because an adequate amount of intrinsic factor is also needed. In cases of severe vitamin B12 deficiency due to inadequate intrinsic factor (pernicious anemia), doctors may prescribe B12 injections in the muscle.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for men and women ages 14 years and older is 2.4 micrograms (mcg) daily. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 2.6 mcg and 2.8 mcg daily, respectively. [1]
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. No upper limit has been set for vitamin B12, as there is no established toxic level.¬†¬†However, some evidence suggests that supplements of 25 mcg per day or higher may increase the risk of bone fractures. [2]
Vitamin B12 is involved in the breakdown of a protein called homocysteine. High homocysteine levels are associated with an increased risk ofheart diseaseand stroke as it may promote the formation of blood clots and excess free radical cells, and may impair normal blood vessel function. A lack of adequate vitamin B12 can increase homocysteine levels.
Although epidemiological studies have found that vitamin B12 supplementation can decrease homocysteine levels, they have not consistently shown a decreased risk of cardiovascular events in taking the vitamin. Therefore the American Heart Association does not advocate for the routine use of B vitamin supplements in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. [1]¬† However,¬† vitamin B12 supplements can be important for some individuals with genetic variants that lead to high homocysteine levels.
High homocysteine levels are linked with a higher incidence of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, dementia, and cognitive decline. Similar to cardiovascular disease, although the research has shown that vitamin B12 supplementation reduces homocysteine blood levels, this has not translated into reduced rates of cognitive decline. A Cochrane review onfolic acidsupplements and cognition, with or without vitamin B12, did not find a significant effect of the supplements vs. placebo on cognitive function in healthy elderly people or people with dementia. [3] Another review of 14 randomized controlled trials also did not consistent evidence of benefit with the use of vitamin B12 supplements, alone or with other B vitamin supplements, on cognitive function in people with either normal or impaired cognition. [4] These findings do not preclude a possible benefit among some individuals with low vitamin B12 levels, and more research is needed.
Food Sources
Measuring vitamin B12 in the blood is actually not the best way to determine whether someone is deficient, as some people with a deficiency can show normal B12 blood levels. Blood levels of methylmalonic acid, a protein breakdown product, and homocysteine are better markers that capture actual vitamin B12 activity. These values increase with a vitamin B12 deficiency. It is estimated that up to 15% of the general population has a vitamin B12 deficiency. [1]
Factors that may cause vitamin B12 deficiency:
Signs of deficiency may include:
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, so any unused amount will exit the body through the urine. Generally, up to 1000 mcg a day of an oral tablet to treat a deficiency is considered safe. The Institute of Medicine states ‚Äúno adverse effects have been associated with excess vitamin B12 intake from food and supplements in healthy individuals.‚Äù [1] However, it is important not to start a high-dosage supplement of any kind without first checking with your doctor.

üîó Are Anti-Nutrients Harmful?
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/anti-nutrients/

The takeaway:The pros and cons of anti-nutrients on long-term human health is an area of active research. Though certain foods may contain residual amounts of anti-nutrients after processing and cooking, the health benefits of eating these foods outweigh any potential negative nutritional effects. Eatinga variety of nutritious foodsdaily and avoiding eating large amounts of a single food at one meal can help to offset minor losses in nutrient absorption caused by anti-nutrients.
The term ‚Äúanti-nutrients‚Äù suggests what they are. Whereas nutrients are substances that nourish plants and animals to grow and live, anti-nutrients earn their title because they can block the absorption of nutrients. Anti-nutrients are naturally found in animals and many plant-based foods. In plants, they are compounds designed to protect from bacterial infections and being eaten by insects. [1]
There are several compounds in the foods we eat classified as anti-nutrients. Examples include:
It is not known how much nutrient loss occurs in our diets because of anti-nutrients, and the effects vary among individuals based on their metabolism and how the food is cooked and prepared. Many anti-nutrients like phytates, lectins, and glucosinolates can be removed or deactivated by soaking, sprouting, or boiling the food before eating.
Another consideration is that these anti-nutrients affect the absorption of nutrients eaten at the same meal. Therefore to lower this risk, it is recommended to avoid eating large quantities of foods containing anti-nutrients at one meal, and to eat a balanced diet throughout the day with a variety of foods. [3] For example, instead of eating two cups of bran cereal with milk for breakfast, choose one cup of cereal with milk and one cup of fresh berries.
People who are at high risk for diseases related to mineral deficiencies, such as osteoporosis with calcium deficiency oranemia with iron deficiency, may wish to monitor their food choices for anti-nutrient content. Another strategy could be altering the timing of eating foods with anti-nutrients. Examples are to drink tea between meals instead of with a meal to reduce the chances of iron being poorly absorbed, or taking acalciumsupplement a few hours after eating a high-fiber wheat bran cereal that contains phytates.
Some studies on vegetarians who eat diets high in plant foods containing anti-nutrients do not generally show deficiencies in iron and zinc, so the body may be adapting to the presence of anti-nutrients by increasing the absorption of these minerals in the gut. [3] Still, other studies have shown that iron stores and blood zinc levels in vegetarians are typically below those of non-vegetarians. [4] How well non-heme iron (the form found in plant foods) and zinc are absorbed in the body is impacted by the amount of inhibitors such as phytates. A review found that these inhibitors negatively affected the absorption of non-heme iron, varying from 1% to 23%. [4]
Keep in mind that anti-nutrients may also exert health benefits. Phytates, for example, have been found to lower cholesterol, slow digestion, and prevent sharp rises in blood sugar. [2] Many anti-nutrients haveantioxidantand anticancer actions, so avoiding them entirely is not recommended. [3,5,8]
A few studies have found a small but significant increased risk of disease with higher intakes of glucosinolates, which are obtained mainly through cruciferous vegetables. In two studies following three large prospective cohorts of 42,170 male and 168,404 female health professionals for several years, a higher intake of glucosinolates was associated with a slightly higher risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes in men and women. Individuals with the highest intakes of glucosinolates had a 19% increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those with the lowest intakes, even after adjusting for other factors that can affect diabetes, such as BMI, physical activity, and smoking. [6] The strongest associations were observed for Brussels sprouts when comparing the highest (1 or more servings/week) and lowest intakes (never or almost never). In a separate analysis of these same three cohorts looking at intakes of glucosinolates and heart disease, participants who consumed one or more servings a week of Brussels sprouts and cabbage had a higher heart disease risk than those who consumed these vegetables less than once per month. [7] The authors did not recommend avoiding these foods but rather emphasized a need for more studies to replicate and confirm these findings to better understand this possible relation, as several other studies have shown a protective effect on diabetes and heart disease with higher intakes of cruciferous vegetables.
Phytic acid, or phytates, is the stored form of phosphorus found in seeds,nuts,legumes, and unprocessedwhole grains(concentrated in the outer bran layers). The amount of phytic acid in these foods varies widely even within the same food, based on the seed type, environmental conditions, climate, and soil quality. Phytic acid can have health benefits due to its antioxidant properties. Laboratory and animal studies show that it can protect against DNA damage and cancer cell growth. The chemical name for phytic acid, inositol hexakisphosphate or IP6, is very actively studied in cancer research and, though research is still early, IP6 has become a popular over-the-counter supplement. Phytic acid can also prevent kidney stones from forming by inhibiting the buildup of calcium crystals, a component of kidney stones.
However, phytic acid is also labeled an antinutrient because humans lack the phytase enzyme needed to break it down. As it passes through the gut, phytic acid binds to minerals likeiron,zinc, andcalciumso they are not well-absorbed in the intestine. This will occur only when phytic acid is eaten with foods containing these minerals at the same meal. The average Western diet usually has enough nutrients and variety to protect from a true deficiency, especially with the inclusion of some animal proteins (e.g., lean pork, poultry, shellfish) that are rich in zinc and heme-iron, a well-absorbed form of iron. A nutrient deficiency more likely occurs in developing countries where a variety of food choices is limited, the risk of malnutrition is higher, and legumes or whole grains are staples that are eaten with every meal. Also at risk are those who eat a vegan diet (which not only consists of plenty of seeds/nuts, legumes, and grains but these foods contain poorly absorbed non-heme iron), or those who already have an iron or zinc deficiency due to medical reasons.
How you prepare foods high in phytic acid can reduce the overall amount. Cooking, soaking overnight in water,sprouting(germination), fermentation, and pickling can all break down phytic acid so that the phosphorus can be released and absorbed by the body. Some natural bacteria in the colon contain the enzyme phytase and can also help to break it down.
Because of the potential health benefits of phytic acid, if your diet contains a variety of plant-based and lean animal foods, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how much you are eating. Only those already at risk for nutrient deficiencies of the minerals mentioned or those who eat only plant foods such as vegans may need to consider reducing phytic acid in the diet.
If you‚Äôve been told by your doctor that you have calcium oxalate stones, the most common type of kidney stones, then you may have been advised to avoid foods high in oxalates. The tricky part is that many healthful plant foods are rich in oxalates including certain green leafy vegetables (spinach, Swiss chard), beets, beans, certain nuts (almonds), rice bran, and potatoes.
After we eat food, the body uses what it needs for energy. Some of the remaining food components not needed are shuttled to the kidneys to be excreted in urine. If there is too much waste and not enough liquid, tiny crystals can form. If there is not enough liquid or urine to flush them out, a high amount of oxalates in the urine can form crystals by attaching to calcium. Sometimes the crystals clump together to form a stone that is painful when it moves to pass.
However, avoiding dietary oxalate is not the only or best way to avoid kidney stones. It is important to drink enough fluids, especially water, to dilute the urine so that substances like oxalates do not collect and stick together. Eating calcium-rich foods at the same time as oxalate-rich foods can also help, as the oxalates will bind to calcium in the stomach, preventing the oxalate from being absorbed into the body. An example is to drink calcium-fortified milk or plant milk with a meal or snack that contains beans, spinach, or nuts.
Some people at risk for kidney stones may ‚Äúhyper-absorb‚Äù oxalates, so in these cases moderating intake of oxalate-rich foods may be particularly helpful. [8] Cooking foods may also lower oxalate content. Oxalates dissolve in water, and some research indicates that boiling vegetables for 12 minutes can lower their oxalate content by 30-87%, with leafy greens like spinach and Swiss chard showing the greatest losses at about 85%. Steaming had less of an effect, showing about 45% loss of oxalates. [8]
Three large cohorts from the Health Professionals Follow-up study and Nurses‚Äô Health Study (NHS) I and II found an average 20% increased risk of forming kidney stones with high oxalate intakes in men and women. [9] Men who had the lowest calcium intakes of less than 755 mg daily and the highest oxalate intakes had a 46% increased risk of developing stones. But higher calcium intakes in men were also found to be significantly protective from developing stones. A follow-up review of the NHS confirmed that higher calcium intakes were protective from kidney stones in women. [10] Other studies have found the DASH diet had a 40-50% lower risk of kidney stones, which may be due to the diet being rich in potassium and magnesium, minerals protective from kidney stones. [11]
Therefore, a dietary strategy to prevent kidney stones is more complex than just avoiding oxalates. For those at risk, drink plenty of water every day, eat enough calcium from foods, and eat low amounts of oxalate-rich foods taken with calcium-rich foods. Always inform your doctor about any dietary changes that are made for health reasons.

üîó Copper
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/copper/

Copper is a naturally occurring metal found in soil, water, and rocks. Nutritionally, it is an essential trace mineral found in some foods and in supplements. It works to assist various enzymes that produce energy for the body, break down and absorb iron, and build red blood cells, collagen, connective tissue, and brain neurotransmitters. Copper also supports normal brain development and immune functions, and is a component of superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that dismantles harmful oxygen ‚Äúfree radicals.‚Äù Copper is absorbed in the small intestine and found mainly in bones and muscle tissue.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 900 micrograms daily for men and women. Pregnancy and lactation in adults 19+ years requires 1,300 micrograms daily, with a slightly lower amount of 1,000 micrograms daily in younger ages 14-18 years.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for copper for adults 19+ years and those pregnant and lactating is 10,000 micrograms daily.
Because dozens of enzymes use copper to perform metabolic processes throughout the body, it is believed that both an excess and deficiency of copper may interrupt these normal processes and a stable level is required for optimal health. The body is typically efficient at stabilizing copper levels (absorption increases if copper intake is low, and vice versa). [1] Abnormal copper levels result from genetic mutations, aging, or environmental influences that may predispose to conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. [2]
Copper can have ‚Äúpro-oxidant‚Äù effects that potentially cause stress and damage to cells. The muscles in the heart contain high concentrations of copper, and may be negatively affected by either a deficiency or toxicity of the mineral. [3] Both conditions have been associated with atherogenesis, the early build-up of plaque in heart arteries. [3,4] Some cohort studies show an association with higher self-reported intakes of copper and lower blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, as well as increased risk ofheart diseasewith a copper deficiency. [3,5] Other cohort studies show an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in people with higher copper blood levels compared with lower levels, although it should be noted that the higher blood levels in these studies remained within a normal range. [4,6] Due to these mixed findings, more research is needed before making conclusions on the cardiovascular effect of copper.
Some research shows that those with higher copper levels have a lower risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), but both low and high blood levels of copper have been reported in the brains of people with AD. [1] A meta-analysis showed that people with AD had higher serum copper levels than those without AD. [7] However, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not show that copper supplements given for 12 months improved cognition in participants with mild AD. [8] Additionally, observational prospective studies have not found that self-reported dietary and total copper intakes are associated with cognitive decline. [1] More research is needed to better understand if and how high or low levels of copper are associated with AD risk.
Copper may play a role incancerfor several reasons. It supports angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels that feed a tumor, and activates enzymes and signaling proteins used by cancer cells. [9,10] An emerging area of research has focused on the role of copper in metastatic cancer cells (these are cells that break away from a primary tumor and spread to other areas in the body). [11] Levels of copper in these aggressive cells were found to be higher than in non-metastatic cancer cells. Intentionally depleting copper levels by blocking its bioavailability may reduce the energy these cells need to travel in the body. Chelation-based treatments that bind to and inactivate copper are being researched. [10]
Copper is found in highest amounts inprotein foodslike organ meats,shellfish,fish,nuts, and seeds as well aswhole grainsandchocolate. The absorption of copper in the body will increase if the diet contains less copper, and decrease if the body has enough copper.
A copper deficiency is rare in the U.S. among healthy people and occurs primarily in people with genetic disorders or malabsorption problems such as Crohn‚Äôs and celiac disease. A genetic condition called Menkes disease interferes with copper absorption, leading to severe deficiency that could become fatal without copper injections. Also, it is possible to create a copper deficiency by taking high doses ofzincsupplements that can block the absorption of copper in the small intestine.
Signs of deficiency include:
Toxicity is rare in healthy individuals as the body is efficient at excreting excess copper. It has been seen with Wilson‚Äôs disease, a rare genetic condition, that prevents copper from exiting the body and therefore leading to high blood levels. Severe liver damage and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may occur. Although very rare, it is possible to consume excess copper if continuously storing and then serving boiling liquids from corroding copper or brass vessels.
Although copper is naturally found in water, excessive levels of copper in drinking water is usually caused by leaked copper from old, corroded household pipes and faucets. There is greater risk if water is stagnant from lack of use or using hot tap water (copper more easily dissolves at higher temperatures). In these cases, exposure to excess copper can be decreased by running cold tap water for several minutes before using. It is also advised to use only cold tap water for drinking and cooking, and to avoid drinking hot tap water.

üîó Processed Foods and Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/processed-foods/

Processed foods are generally thought to be inferior to unprocessed foods. The term may suggest that a packaged food item contains many ingredients, perhaps even artificial colors, flavors, or other chemical additives. Often referred to as convenience or pre-prepared foods, processed foods are suggested to contribute to the obesity epidemic and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. However, the definition of processed food varies widely depending on the source:
According to these standards, virtually all foods sold in the supermarket would be classified as ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù to some degree. Because food begins to deteriorate and loses nutrients as soon as it is harvested, even theapplesin the produce aisle undergo four or more processing steps before being sold to the consumer. That‚Äôs why in practice, it‚Äôs helpful to differentiate between the various degrees of food processing.
A popular system to classify processed foods was introduced in 2009, called the NOVA classification. It lists four categories considering the degree to which a food is processed and the purpose of these modifications: [2-4]
The NOVA system is recognized by the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization, but not currently in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration or USDA. NOVA has been criticized for being too general in classifying certain foods, causing confusion. For example, yogurt may fall into more than one category: plain yogurt is minimally processed, but fruited yogurt with added sweeteners could be labeled either processed or ultra-processed depending on how much sweetener and other chemical additives are incorporated. NOVA also does not provide comprehensive lists of specific foods in each category, so the consumer is left to guess where each may fall.
There‚Äôs no doubt that at least some processed foods are found in most people‚Äôs kitchens. There are benefits and drawbacks.
Depending on the degree of processing, nutrients can be destroyed or removed. Peeling outer layers of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may remove plant nutrients (phytochemicals) and fiber. Heating or drying foods can destroy certain vitamins and minerals. Although food manufacturers can add back some of the nutrients lost, it is impossible to recreate the food in its original form.
Currently, bread and frozen meals are some of the most consumed ultra-processed foods in the U.S. [5] While these products can be good sources of whole grains, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, they can also be high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. Given the variety of ultra-processed foods, it may be helpful to distinguish those with lower nutritional value from the broader category. Such distinction can be determined by evaluating a food‚Äôs nutritional content and long-term health effects. A product with an unevenly high ratio of calories to fiber and healthy nutrients (e.g., unsaturated fats, B vitamins, potassium) may be considered an ‚Äúultra-processed food of low nutritional value.‚Äù For example, soda provides high calories from added sugars and no healthy nutrients; and research supports an association between a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. On the other hand, whole-grain bread and fiber-containing low-sugar breakfast cereals that may be fortified with nutrients such as folic acid have consistently been linked with lower rates of stroke. [6]
To help illustrate the spectrum of food processing, the table below includes ultra-processed foods of low nutritional value as its own category. We also we separate the NOVA categories of ‚Äúunprocessed‚Äù and ‚Äúminimally processed‚Äù foods, and omit NOVA‚Äôs ‚Äúprocessed culinary ingredients‚Äù category, which mainly includes supplementary food components to assist in cooking and food preparation.
store-bought hummus made with chickpeas, spices, and oil without preservatives
Ingredients used widely in the production of ultra-processed foods such assaturated fats,added sugar, andsodiumhave become markers of poor diet quality due to their effect on heart disease, obesity, and high blood pressure. [8,9] It is estimated that ultra-processed foods contribute about 90% of the total calories obtained from added sugars. [5]
Food processing is a very broad spectrum that ranges from basic technologies like freezing or milling, to the incorporation of additives that promote shelf stability or increase palatability. As a general rule, emphasizing unprocessed or minimally processed foods in the daily diet is optimal. That said, the use of processed and even ultra-processed foods is the choice of the consumer, and there are pros and cons that come with each type. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a more processed food in one‚Äôs diet. There is evidence showing an association with certain types of food processing and poor health outcomes, especially low-nutrient ultra-processed foods that containadded sugars,excess sodium, andunhealthful fats. But there also exist ultra-processed foods that have low amounts of these ingredients while being fortified in beneficial nutrients such as calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins B and D.
Research is still clarifying if any harmful health effects from ultra-processed foods arise from the higher degree of processing or simply from the poorer nutritional quality often accompanying these types of foods. There is a growing range of processed and ultra-processed foods available, and some products may be a useful addition to a healthful diet.
You don‚Äôt have to avoid all processed foods but begin by adding more fresh or minimally processed ingredients to your shopping cart. More time may be needed to prepare these foods than just opening a can or popping a frozen container in a microwave, but the rewards may be fresher flavors, increased nutrients, and eating less additives that have no nutritional benefit.

üîó Rice
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/rice/

Rice is a main staple in more than 100 countries worldwide. [1] In some households, rice is included with more than one meal a day. This starchy high-calorie grain is generally low cost, making it accessible to all and a vital base of many diets. Each country showcases a rice specialty to reflect local spices and taste preferences: risotto in Italy, paella in Spain, jambalaya in the southern U.S., coconut rice in Colombia, steamed rice in China, rice and beans in Mexico, and sweet rice in Portugal, to name a few.
The scientific name for rice isOryza. Oryza sativais the most common species and is subdivided into the long-grainindica, and short-grainjaponica. Tools for farming rice have been found in China dating back 8000 years. Merchant traders helped the gradual spread of rice across the continents.
(*primarilywhole grainvarieties)
There are thousands of types ofOryza sativa, which can differ in size, thickness, stickiness, color, aroma, and flavor. Rice is often broadly categorized based on its shape or method of processing:
This refers to the length and width of the rice grain after cooking:
Is the rice in its whole, intact form (like ‚Äúbrown‚Äù rice), or has it been milled and polished (like ‚Äúwhite‚Äù rice)?
Of course, when it comes to cooking, specific varieties of rice are often chosen for their unique characteristics. Here are a few popular types:
Because large amounts of rice are eaten in some countries, along with an increasing worldwide prevalence oftype 2 diabetesand insulin resistance, rice intake‚Äôs effect on health has been studied.
The glycemic index(GI) is a measure of how quickly and how much a food raises one‚Äôs blood sugar levels after eating. Rice is considered a high GI food but it varies depending on the type and amount of processing (processing increases the GI). Reports show the GI of rice ranging from 48-93. [2] Low GI foods have a rating of 55 or less, medium GI foods are 56-69, and high GI foods are 70-100. The average GI for brown rice is low at 55, whereas the GI for white rice is higher at 64. [3] Observational studies have found an association between a high GI diet and greater risk for type 2 diabetes.
The message of these studies was consistent with public health recommendations to replace refined grains with whole grains, and to choose at least two servings of whole grains a day to reduce type 2 diabetes risk.
In a large cohort study of 71,750 women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and 42,823 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, intakes of brown rice did not lower the risk of ischemic stroke. [6] However, intakes of brown rice in this group were generally lower than intakes of other grain foods that did decrease stroke risk like whole grain cereals and bran. A systematic review of 45 studies on whole grains did not find a reduced risk of stroke, heart disease, or cancer from intakes of either white or brown rice. [7]
Arsenic is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in soil, rock, and water. The term ‚Äútotal arsenic‚Äù includes organic and inorganic arsenic compounds. Organic arsenic is found mostly in seafood and is considered less toxic. Inorganic arsenic is toxic and found in soil, groundwater, and industrial chemicals. Though a high amount of inorganic arsenic is deadly, long-term exposure to lower levels is also concerning as it may increase the risk of various diseases.
In 2012, reports surfaced about the potentially high levels of inorganic arsenic in rice. [8] The amount in our food supply results largely from contaminated groundwater and soil from livestock manure, fertilizer, pesticides, and industrial waste. [9] This is concerning to individuals who eat rice daily. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term exposure to arsenic can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Exposure to arsenic at young ages has been linked to certain cancers and neurological defects. [1]
Arsenic accumulates in rice 10 times more than in other grains due to being cultivated in water-flooded fields, where irrigation water as well as the soil may be contaminated with arsenic. [10] The rice grain easily absorbs arsenic into its roots through water. In the U.S., rice grown in southern states contains high amounts of arsenic because of residual metals in the soil from the historical use of arsenic-laced pesticides to treat cotton crops. Rice products such as rice cereal and rice crackers may also contain high levels of arsenic. The amount of arsenic in other types of rice such as black or red depends on the exact species and the amount of inorganic arsenic in the soil and water supply, which can vary greatly by region.
There is no federal limit for arsenic in food and beverages other than water. The standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). One report found as much as 193 ppm in brown rice grown in the southern U.S. [2] A later report by the FDA also found high levels with an average concentration of 154 ppb in brown rice. [11]
Early life exposure to arsenic increases the risk of negative health effects later in life. Non-profit organizations have pushed for federal standards limiting the amount of arsenic in the food supply. Congress introduced a bill in 2012 called the RICE Act (Reducing food-based Inorganic and Organic Compounds Exposure Act) to establish limits on the amount of total arsenic allowed in rice and rice products. [12] In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drafted a proposed limit of 100 ppb in infant rice cereal and juice, but further action by the FDA or voluntary standards by manufacturers have not been established. [13] The FDA advised that parents give infants a variety of fortified cereals other than rice such as oat, barley, and multigrain. Pregnant women and toddlers should also eat a variety of whole grains other than rice. [14]
Additional ways to reduce arsenic exposure from rice:
If you eat brown rice or brown rice products frequently or more than four times a week, consider purchasing brands grown in non-polluted regions (such as California as opposed to Arkansas or Texas).

üîó Bananas
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/bananas/

There‚Äôs a bit of confusion surrounding bananas. Some people consider this iconic golden fruit a healthy choice while others avoid it, after seeing it on Internet lists of ‚Äú5 Worst Foods.‚Äù Unfavorable claims suggest that bananas cause weight gain and constipation. An article from 1917 published in theJournal of the American Medical Associationdefended the nutritional value of bananas, citing rumored beliefs during that time: ‚ÄúThe banana is a cause of indigestion and a treacherous dietary component‚Ä¶‚Äù [1]
The scientific name for banana isMusa, from the Musaceae family of flowering tropical plants, which distinctively showcases the banana fruit clustered at the top of the plant. The mild-tasting and disease-resistant Cavendish type is the main variety sold in the U.S. and Europe. Despite some negative attention, bananas are nutritious and may even carry the title of the first ‚Äúsuperfood,‚Äù endorsed by the American Medical Association in the early 20th century as a health food for children and a treatment for celiac disease.
One serving, or one medium ripe banana, provides about 110 calories, 0 gram fat, 1 gram protein, 28 grams carbohydrate, 15 grams sugar (naturally occurring), 3 grams fiber, and 450 mg potassium.
The following are other banana varieties less commonly available in the U.S.
Bananas are an excellent source ofpotassium, a vital mineral and electrolyte in the body that carries a small electrical charge. These charges cause nerve cells to send out signals for the heart to beat regularly and muscles to contract. Potassium is also needed to maintain a healthy balance of water in cells, and offsets the effects of excess dietary sodium. An imbalance in the diet of too little potassium and too much sodium can lead to high blood pressure. Excessive sodium can lead to a buildup of fluid in the blood, placing pressure on the walls of blood vessels and eventually causing damage. Potassium helps the body to flush out extra sodium in the urine, and eases tension in blood vessel walls. Bananas, rich in potassium and fiber and low in sodium, are an important component of heart-healthy diets likeDASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)that aims for about 4,700 mg dietary potassium daily.
Bananas are included in the BRAT diet (an acronym for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast), a once commonly prescribed regimen for patients with diarrhea or who required a bland, easy-to-digest diet after stomach ailments. Not just easy to eat, bananas can help replete electrolytes like potassium that are lost with diarrhea or vomiting, and contain resistant starch (especially if using cooked less-ripe green bananas) that may support gut healing.
Unripe bananas contain resistant starch, a type of carbohydrate that ‚Äúresists‚Äù digestion in the small intestine. It is absorbed slowly and does not cause sharp rises in blood sugar. The starch acts as food for the growth ofbeneficial microbesin the digestive tract. Microbes break down and ferment the starch as it passes into the large intestine, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that may play a role in the prevention of chronic diseases including digestive disorders. Clinical studies have shown the potential use of SCFA in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn‚Äôs disease, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. [2]
There is no evidence that bananas contribute to weight gain, despite popular belief. In an analysis of three large prospective cohort studies, researchers looked for associations between reported intakes of specific fruits and vegetables and weight changes in 133,468 U.S. men and women followed for up to 24 years. [3] The results were adjusted to account for other factors that can contribute to weight changes like smoking and physical activity. Though higher intakes of apples, pears, and berries tended to more strongly show a link to less weight gain over time, bananas were also associated with less weight gain.
According to the International Glycemic Index Database, ripe bananas have a low GI of 51, with slightly under-ripe bananas even lower at 42; they have a moderate GL of 13 and 11, respectively. Why is the glycemic load score higher if the glycemic index is low? It may be due to the higher carbohydrate content of bananas (there are 28 grams in one medium banana vs. about 19 grams in a medium apple); this will increase the glycemic load. However, the type of carbohydrate in bananas is classified asresistant starch, which functions similarly to dietary fiber. Resistant starch is not broken down in the small intestine so it causes less glucose to be released into the bloodstream. This produces a lower glycemic index and a greater feeling of satiety as the starch is digested slowly.

üîó Oats
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/oats/

Oats, formally namedAvena sativa, is a type of cereal grain from thePoaceaegrass family of plants. The grain refers specifically to the edible seeds of oat grass, which is what ends up in our breakfast bowls. Whether loved or hated for their mushy yet hearty texture when cooked, oats are most prized for their nutritional value and health benefits. The Food and Drug Administration allows the use of a health claim on food labels associating a reduced risk of coronary heart disease with the consumption of beta-glucan soluble fiber fromwhole grainoats. [1] Oatmeal is also a desired asset to those trying to lose weight and control hunger levels due to its high water and soluble fiber content.
Oats contain several components that have been proposed to exert health benefits. The primary type of soluble fiber in oats is beta-glucan, which has been researched to help slow digestion, increase satiety, and suppress appetite. Beta-glucan can bind with cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestine and transport them through the digestive tract and eventually out of the body. Whole oats also contain plant chemicals called phenolic compounds and phytoestrogens that act as antioxidants to reduce the damaging effects of chronic inflammation that is associated with various diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [2]
Because available research specific to oats is limited, most of the studies below assessed whole grain intake, which included several types of whole grains in addition to oats. Therefore, the findings cannot be applied to oats alone.

üîó Whole Grains
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/

Choose whole grains instead of refined grains.
Whole grains offer a ‚Äúcomplete package‚Äù of health benefits, unlike refined grains, which are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process.
All whole grain kernels contain three parts: the bran, germ, and endosperm. Each section houses health-promoting nutrients. The bran is thefiber-rich outer layer that suppliesB vitamins,iron, copper,zinc,magnesium,antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are natural chemical compounds in plants that have been researched for their role in disease prevention. The germ is the core of the seed where growth occurs; it is rich in healthy fats,vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. The endosperm is the interior layer that holds carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals.
These components have various effects on our bodies:
The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat‚Äôs B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.
A growing body of research shows that choosing whole grains and other less-processed, higher-quality sources of carbohydrates, and cutting back on refined grains, improves health in many ways. For a closer look at carbohydrates, check out ourCarbohydrate Guide.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1]¬†However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains:
Be careful when choosing foods labeled as whole grains: ‚ÄúWhole grain‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean healthy.
One study revealed that inconsistent food labeling means that foods identified as ‚Äúwhole grain‚Äù are not always healthy.¬†[2]
Consumers should steer towards whole grain foods that are high in fiber and that have few ingredients in addition to whole grain. Moreover, eating whole grains in their¬†whole¬†forms‚Äîsuch asbrown rice, barley,oats, corn, and rye‚Äîare healthy choices because they pack in the nutritional benefits of whole grains without any additional ingredients.
As researchers have begun to look more closely at carbohydrates and health, they are learning thatthe quality of the carbohydratesyou eat is at least as important as the quantity. Most studies, including some from several different Harvard teams, show a connection between whole grains and better health.¬†[3]
Cardiovascular disease
Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.
Type 2 diabetes
Replacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes. [8]¬†In contrast, refined grains tend to have a high glycemic index and glycemic load with less fiber and nutrients.
Cancer
The data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect of whole grains and others showing none. [12,13]
Digestive health
By keeping the stool soft and bulky, the fiber in whole grains helps prevent constipation, a common, costly, and aggravating problem. It also helps prevent diverticular disease (diverticulosis) by decreasing pressure in the intestines.¬†[17]
Some grains contain the naturally-occurring protein, gluten. While gluten can cause side effects in certain individuals, such as those with celiac disease, most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives‚Äîwithout any adverse reaction. However, negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet, though there is little published research to support such claims. For further information on gluten and health, see:Gluten: A Benefit or Harm to the Body?

üîó Sleep
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sleep/

Sleep is as essential to our daily needs as food and water. Although we may feel that sleep simply rests our tired bodies, our brain remains active throughout the night. Sleep plays a critical role in brain as well as physical functioning.
Our internal body clock, called a circadian clock, tells us when we are ready to sleep. There are actually several circadian clocks in the body, found in the brain and other organs. They are triggered by cues such as daylight (we feel alert) and darkness (we feel drowsy). These clocks can also be triggered by artificial bright light or stimulants like caffeine and alcohol that cause us to feel awake even if it is nighttime.
There are several phases of sleep our body experiences. They are classified as REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM sleep. We cycle repeatedly through these phases about 4-6 times throughout the night, and it is not uncommon to wake up briefly between cycles.
Non-REM sleep
Stage 1.You transition from being awake to a restful state.
Stage 2.You are in a light sleep state. Your breathing, heart rate, and muscle movements slow down. Brain activity also slows, and your body temperature drops.
Stage 3.You are in a deep sleep state. This stage often occurs early in the sleep cycle immediately following light sleep. Your heart rate and breathing are the slowest during this phase, and you are not easily awakened. Events of the day are processed and stored in your memory. A lack of deep sleep can leave one feeling tired in the morning even if achieving an adequate duration of sleep.
REM sleep
During REM, your pupils twitch and move quickly from side to side underneath closed eyelids. Brain activity rises as you breathe faster and your heart rate increases. It is the phase of sleep when dreams are most common, and certain nerves signal your limbs to become temporarily paralyzed so you do not act out the dream. REM tends to occur later at night and into early morning. Memory is processed and stored during REM sleep.
There are various neurotransmitters and hormones released by the brain that send signals to promote sleep or wakefulness. [1] Many of these chemicals are stimulated by light or darkness.
About one-third of American adults do not get enough sleep each night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [2,3] Short sleep duration in adults is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep in 24 hours. About 40% of adults report unintentionally falling asleep during the day at least once a month, and up to 70 million Americans have chronic sleep problems. Because of the public health burden of poor sleep health, achieving sufficient sleep in children and adults was included as a goal in the Healthy People 2020 goals. [4]
Sleep helps to process your thoughts from the day as well as store memories, so a lack of good-quality sleep can lead to difficulty focusing and thinking clearly. You may feel tired, irritable, or anxious during the day. Performance at work or school may suffer. Your reaction time may be slowed, increasing the risk of driving accidents.
In children, insufficient sleep can lead to attention and behavior problems or hyperactivity. In the elderly, lack of sleep may decrease focus and attention, leading to a greater risk of falls, bone fractures, and car accidents.
There are several reasons people may get insufficient sleep:
If you experience continued sleep deprivation, you will develop a condition called sleep deficiency. This is a state in which you cannot make up the many lost hours of sleep. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and even early death.
Several studies show that sleep deprivation (i.e., regularly less than 7 hours of sleep a night) is a risk factor for obesity. A Nurses‚Äô Health Study found an association between those who slept the least (5 hours or less a night) and having the highest BMI and greatest weight gain. [5] One reason may be a disruption in appetite hormones that regulate feelings of hunger (called ghrelin) versus satisfaction (called leptin). Ghrelin levels rise while leptin levels drop with lack of sleep; this can cause higher calories to be consumed due to experiencing strong hunger at the same time that one feels less satiated after eating. A preference for foods high in fat and carbohydrate has been observed. [6,7] The risk of hunger also increases simply by being awake longer, which prolongs the time from the last meal eaten to bedtime. [6] Insufficient sleep also can trigger the ‚Äúreward‚Äù areas in your brain to crave high fat, high caloric foods. [8]
One may think that getting less sleep would mean more activity due to being awake longer and therefore using more calories. However, studies have found either no increase or very small increases in energy expenditure with sleep deprivation, and even a tendency towards reducedphysical activitydue to fatigue. [9] Less physical activity combined with the increased calorie intake associated with sleep deprivation increases the risk of obesity.
Other effects of poor sleep include increased fat storage in the belly area, higher body mass index, poorer quality diet, and decreased insulin sensitivity. [6,10] Interestingly, some studies have also shown that longer sleep times (more than 9 hours) are also associated with developing belly fat compared with sleeping 7-8 hours a night. [7]
Epidemiological and laboratory studies show a higher risk ofdiabetes mellituswith both too little sleep (less than 7 hours) and longer sleep durations (more than 9 hours). Metabolic changes may occur with chronic insufficient sleep, such as higher cortisol levels leading to increased blood glucose. Clinical studies have found both increased glucose and insulin levels (suggesting insulin resistance) and reduced insulin sensitivity in sleep-deprived individuals. [11] Disruption in the regulation of appetite hormones as seen with higher ghrelin and lower leptin levels may lead to increased food intake and weight gain, also increasing the risk of insulin resistance. [11]
Some people who have insufficient sleep have a condition called obstructive sleep apnea, which blocks breathing in the upper airway tubes, often because of increased fat in the tongue. Sleep apnea is independently associated with insulin resistance; a lack of oxygen while sleeping can cause oxidative stress and inflammation that are believed to progress toward insulin resistance. [11]
Both shorter and longer sleep durations are associated withcardiovascular diseases. [12,13] Proposed reasons include activation of the sympathetic nervous system and impaired endothelial function, which can lead to elevated blood pressure and hardening of arteries. There may also be greater release of pro-inflammatory cells and decreased immune function. Metabolic changes include a disruption in appetite hormones and circadian rhythms that lead to inflammatory conditions. [14]
Poor sleep and insomnia (an inability to sleep or stay asleep) are associated with depression, especially if the insomnia becomes chronic. [20] Insomnia is also associated with increased likelihood of insomnia relapsing over time. Poor sleep quality can impair functioning, increase fatigue, and lead to mood changes. The reverse is also true in which depressive symptoms of intense sadness or hopelessness can interrupt sleep. Insomnia as well as oversleeping are common signs of clinical depression, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. [21] Treating the depression may lead to improvements in sleep quality. If there is an underlying medical disorder causing the insomnia such as obstructive sleep apnea or chronic pain, then treatment should address these first.
In 2021, authors of a cohort study sought to tease out the association of early brain changes and sleep changes by including younger patients 50 years of age. They followed 7,959 participants for up to 25 years and found that participants who were between the ages of 50-70 years and slept 6 hours or less a night showed a 30% higher risk of developing dementia in later life, compared with those who slept 7 hours. [40] The association was only slightly weaker when authors controlled for various factors independently associated with dementia like cardiometabolic status (high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, cardiovascular disease), sociodemographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status), health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, exercise, intake of fruits and vegetables), and mental health factors (depression). The authors did not find an association with longer sleep durations (8 or more hours) and dementia, though this may have been due to the low number of participants who slept longer durations.
Prospective cohort studies have found that both a chronic lack of sleep (less than 7 hours) and long sleep durations (more than 8 hours) are associated with greater risk of death from all causes. [7,13] Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are also associated with increased mortality. [22,23]However, long sleep durations appear to be more associated with increased risk of mortality than inadequate sleep. [13] Some studies show that women may have greater risk of mortality related to short sleep durations than men. [24] Longer sleep times are associated with several factors that are associated with mortality, including fatigue, stress, obstructive sleep apnea, and increased inflammation of heart arteries. More research with randomized controlled trials is needed to better understand the reasons for these findings.
Epidemiological studies show that insufficient sleep is independently associated with a higher risk of obesity. Clinical studies of of sleep-restricted adults show an increased hunger and calorie intake when participants are allowed free access to food. [7] A preference for late evening or nighttime food intake and increased snacking has been observed. [9] There also appears to be a food preference for higher carbohydrate and fat foods, which could partly explain the overall higher calorie intake.
Changes in hormone levels that signal either hunger or satiety have also been observed in clinical sleep restriction studies. Leptin is a hormone associated with satisfaction. When food enters the stomach, leptin is released from fat cells and travels to the brain where it signals the body to stop eating by creating a sensation of fullness. People with obesity may actually have very high levels of leptin; the more body fat one has, the more leptin is produced in fat cells. However, a condition called leptin resistance may occur in which the brain does not receive the usual signal from leptin to stop eating. In response, more and more leptin is released. Lower leptin levels as well as high leptin levels suggesting leptin resistance have been observed in sleep-deprived adults. [7]
Ghrelin, the ‚Äúhunger hormone,‚Äù typically has the opposing action of leptin. It is released in the gut and sends hunger signals to the brain when someone is not eating enough. About three hours after eating a meal, ghrelin levels drop. Clinical studies have found that sleep restriction leads to elevated ghrelin levels. [9]
Despite this interesting theory of poor sleep leading to changes in appetite hormone levels, other studies have found no changes and therefore the association is still inconclusive. [9] Conflicting findings may be due to differences in the study participants (e.g., age, gender) and differences in how the researchers defined the duration and severity of sleep restriction.
Sleep needs change as we age, with the average person generally requiring less sleep at older ages. However, specific sleep amounts vary by individual. According to the National Sleep Foundation and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), newborns need the most sleep, at 14-17 hours a day, followed by infants at 12-16 hours a day including naps. Toddlers need about 10-14 hours a day. Preteens and teenagers need about 8-12 hours a night, and adults about 7-8 hours a day. [30] A consensus by the AASM and Sleep Research Society recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours a night to promote optimal health. [31]
Despite these general recommendations on sleep duration, individual differences in sleep requirements exist. In most epidemiologic studies, increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as obesity,diabetes, andcardiovascular disease, has been observed among those who reported sleeping 5 hours or less per day, and 9 hours or more per day. Thus, a range of sleep hours (more than 5 and less than 9) is considered appropriate for most healthy adults.
Other factors such as quality of sleep are important, because just meeting the total recommended sleep hours may not be enough if one wakes up frequently in the night. A common belief is that lost sleep from a late night out or studying can be recovered by ‚Äúsleeping in‚Äù another day or taking naps. However, both of these methods disrupt the body‚Äôs circadian rhythms and may deprive the body of deeper sleep stages. In fact, increased variability in how much sleep we get from night to night is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic and heart diseases. [32] It is important to respond, whenever possible, to the body‚Äôs natural signals of sleepiness.
Two popular herbal supplements, melatonin and valerian, are used as sleep aids. Melatonin has been shown to quicken time to sleep and have modest benefits on sleep duration and quality, but can cause daytime drowsiness. It is well tolerated in adults with few reported adverse events in doses up to 10 mg. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the judicious use of melatonin for certain sleep and circadian disorders such as shift work disorder or jet lag. [33]
Valerian contains small amounts of GABA, a sleep-promoting neurotransmitter, and some studies have shown that valerian can improve sleep. However, other studies have found no difference in sleep when taking valerian compared with placebo, and there appears to be minimal benefit in those who have diagnosed insomnia. The AASM does not recommend valerian for insomnia disorder. [33]
It is important to note that supplements are not reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safety or effectiveness. Therefore doses and preparations of these herbs can vary widely. A study of 31 melatonin products found that the melatonin levels in the pills ranged between 83%-478% of the dose reported on the label. [33] More than 70% of the products varied from the labeled dose by more than 10%. If supplements are used, look for a label verifying its quality from a third-party, such as from the U.S. Pharmacopeia.
Sleep medicines
Common medicines prescribed for sleep include sedatives such as benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan*). They help with falling asleep initially, but tend to reduce the amount of deeper sleep. They are not recommended for long-term use because they can worsen insomnia, increase depression, and impair memory, and are associated with increased risk of falls, cancer, and early death. [34] Long-term use of benzodiazepines can promote psychological dependence, and there is a risk of addiction and abuse. [35] Tolerance can also develop over time, requiring larger doses to maintain their effectiveness. Because of these side effects, benzodiazepines are not recommended to treat insomnia in older adults. [35] There are other classes of sleep medications including non-benzodiazepines (e.g., Lunesta, Ambien) and antidepressants (e.g., Zoloft) that also quicken the time to fall asleep but may interfere with deeper sleep stages. Anticholinergic medications (e.g., Benadryl) can increase the risk for cognitive impairment and decline. Generally, sleep medicines are most effective when used occasionally or for a short time of less than one month. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends that cognitive behavioral therapy be used as the initial treatment for insomnia. [*The inclusion of brand names is included for reference and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse any specific brands.]
Other therapies
Randomized clinical trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) for sleep such as minimizing napping during the day, relaxation training, breathing exercises, and sleep hygiene are highly effective and recommended as first-line treatments for insomnia. [35,33] They have been found more effective than medications for the long-term management of insomnia. People may be asked to keep a sleep journal to record sleep habits and activities performed around bedtime, which can help determine the most appropriate CBT.

üîó Protein
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/protein/

Protein is an essential macronutrient, but not all food sources of protein are created equal, and you may not need as much as you think. Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods.
Jump to:‚ÄìWhat is protein?‚ÄìHow much protein do I need?‚ÄìIt‚Äôs all about the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù‚ÄìResearch on protein and human health‚ÄìProtein foods and the planet‚ÄìThe bottom line: choosing healthy protein foods‚Äì[Quiz] Test your protein knowledge!
Protein is found throughout the body‚Äîin muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.
Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don‚Äôt store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids‚Äîhistidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine‚Äîknown as the¬†essential¬†amino acids, must come from food.
The National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, orjust over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. [1]
The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake‚Äîanywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there‚Äôs relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. Individual needs will vary based on factors such as age, exercise level, health conditions, and overall dietary pattern. A registered dietitian can help determine one‚Äôs individual protein needs.
In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.
‚ÄúPure‚Äù protein, whether derived from plant or animal foods, probably has similar effects on health, although the mix of amino acids can have health implications. Some proteins found in food are ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù meaning they contain all twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein in the body. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more of the nine essential amino acids, which our bodies can‚Äôt make from scratch or from other amino acids. Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose¬†to incorporate complete plant proteins likequinoaandchia seeds.
It‚Äôs important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don‚Äôt get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreasedimmunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death.
However, it‚Äôs uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there‚Äôs an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3]
When we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It‚Äôs this protein¬†‚Äúpackage‚Äù¬†that‚Äôs likely to make a difference for health.
The table below shows a sample of food ‚Äúpackages‚Äù sorted by protein content, alongside a range of components that come with it.
To call out a few examples:
Available evidence indicates that it‚Äôs¬†the source of protein (or, the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù), rather than the amount of protein, that likely makes a difference for our health. You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here‚Äôs the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death.
Research conducted at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health has found that eating even small amounts of red meat‚Äîespecially processed red meat‚Äîon a regular basis is linked to an increased risk ofheart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. [4-6] Conversely, replacing red and processed red meat with healthy protein sources such as beans, soy foods, nuts, fish, or poultry seems to reduce these risks. One of the reasons why plant sources of protein are related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to protein from red meat and dairy is because of thedifferent types of fatin these protein packages. Plant-based protein sources are more unsaturated, which lowers LDL cholesterol‚Äîan established risk factor for heart disease. Also, plant sources contain nocholesterol. Other factors are likely to contribute to the lower risk, but this is a key factor.
In terms of theamount¬†of proteinconsumed, there‚Äôs evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet may be beneficial for the heart, as long as the protein comes from a healthy source.
Again, thesource of proteinmatters more than protein¬†quantity¬†when it comes to diabetes risk. Eating more red meat predicts a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while consuming nuts, legumes, and poultry is related to lower risk.
When it comes to cancer, once again, thesource of proteinseems to matter more than quantity.
The same healthy protein foods that are good choices for disease prevention may also help with weight control. Again, it‚Äôs thesource of proteinthat matters.
There‚Äôs no need to go overboard on protein. Though some studies show benefits of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets in the short term (such as thepaleo diet), avoiding fruits and whole grains means missing out on healthful fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients.
To give you an idea, this ‚Äúscorecard‚Äù from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken¬†and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it‚Äôs also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination.
Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods, many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein ‚Äúpackages‚Äù are created equal. Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it‚Äôs important to pay attention to what else is coming with it. That‚Äôs why theHealthy Eating Plateencourages choosing healthy protein foods.
Building off this general guidance, here are some additional details and tips for shaping your diet with the best protein choices:

üîó Fiber
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/carbohydrates/fiber/

Fiber is atype of carbohydratethat the body can‚Äôt digest. Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules called glucose, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps regulate the body‚Äôs use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in check.
Children and adults need at least 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15 grams a day. Great sources arewhole grains,whole fruits and vegetables,legumes, andnuts.
Fiber comes in two varieties, both beneficial to health:
Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber includeoatmeal,chia seeds, nuts, beans,lentils,apples, and blueberries.
Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers include whole wheat products (especially wheat bran),quinoa,brown rice, legumes, leafy greens likekale,almonds, walnuts, seeds, and fruits with edible skins like pears and apples.
The National Academy of Medicine defines fiber as: 1) dietary fibers (nondigestible carbohydrates and lignans) that occur naturally in plants, and 2) functional fibers that are extracted from plants or synthetically made and are nondigestible with a beneficial health effect in humans. [1] Some types of fiber fall into both categories, such as oligosaccharides and resistant starches that may be naturally occurring or synthetically made.
Naturally occurring plant fibers:
Manufactured functional fibers, some of which are extracted and modified from natural plants:
Fiber appears to lower the risk of developing various conditions, includingheart disease,diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation. Fiber‚Äôs beneficial role in the gutmicrobiomemay produce anti-inflammatory effects that alleviate the chronic inflammation associated with these conditions. [2]
Soluble fiber attracts water in the gut, forming a gel, which can slow digestion. This may help prevent blood glucose surges after eating and reduce hunger. Control of blood glucose and weight is important because these are risk factors for diabetes, a condition which doubles the risk of developingheart disease.
Soluble fiber may also lower blood cholesterol by interfering with bile acid production. Cholesterol is used to make bile acids in the liver. Soluble fiber binds to bile acids in the gut and excretes them from the body. Because of this reduced amount of available bile acids, the liver will pull cholesterol from the blood to make new bile acids, thereby lowering blood cholesterol. [3] A meta-analysis of 67 controlled trials found a modest benefit of dietary soluble fiber in lowering total and LDL cholesterol. [4]
Epidemiological studies find that a high intake of dietary fiber is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and deaths from cardiovascular disease. [5-7] In large cohorts of male and female health professionals, researchers found that higher intakes of cereal fibers were associated with a lower risk of heart disease and heart attacks. [8,9] Keep in mind that cereal fiber doesn‚Äôt necessarily refer to the aisle of boxed breakfast cereals in your local supermarket. ‚ÄúCereals‚Äù in these studies referred to the seeds of minimally refinedwhole grainsthat include the germ, bran, and endosperm. Examples are steel-cut oats, quinoa, brown rice, millet, barley, and buckwheat.
A higher fiber intake has also been linked to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, a combination of factors that increases the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes: high blood pressure, high insulin levels, excess weight (especially around the belly), high triglyceride levels, and low HDL (good) cholesterol. [10,11]
Diets low in fiber, especially insoluble types, may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Large cohort studies of women found that a diet low in fiber (especially lacking cereal fibers) but containing foods with a high glycemic index (causing blood glucose surges) increased the risk of developing T2DM. [12,13] Other large cohorts of male and female health professionals have found that high-fiber whole grains (brown rice, rye, oats, wheat bran) are most strongly associated with lower diabetes risk. [14,15] Fibers from fruits and vegetables do not appear to have as strong an association. [16]
Read about what you can do to help preventtype 2 diabetes.
A prospective cohort study of more than 90,000 premenopausal women found that a higher fiber intake as well as eating fiber during adolescence reduced breastcancer risk. When comparing the highest to lowest intakes of fiber, there was a 25% reduced risk of breast cancer. [32] This protection of dietary fiber on breast cancer risk was also found in a later meta-analysis of 17 prospective cohort studies when comparing highest to lowest fiber intakes. It was found protective from both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers. [33]
A high-fiber diet was also associated with a lower risk of benign breast disease, a risk factor in adolescents for the later development of breast cancer. [34]
Earlier epidemiological studies show mixed results on the association of fiber and colorectalcancer(CRC). [27]
One reason may be due to differing effects of fiber on specific subtypes of CRC. When accounting for this, fiber was found to be protective with certain subtypes. [28] A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found fibers from fruits, vegetables, and legumes to offer some protection from CRC, but cereal fibers showed a stronger association with CRC prevention. [29] Other later meta-analyses have also found significant associations between a high-fiber diet and lower risk of CRC. [30,31]
Constipation is generally defined as having three or fewer bowel movements a week, difficulty or pain passing bowel movements, or small hard ‚Äúpebbly‚Äù stool. Occasional bouts of constipation are common, but chronic constipation that does not resolve can lower quality of life and lead to symptoms of bloating, cramping, and even nausea. Chronic constipation increases the risk of diverticular disease and hemorrhoids.
Lifestyle behaviors that help relieve constipation include eating more fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; drinking more water; and regular exercise. There are various reasons why fiber reduces constipation. Some types of soluble fiber bind to water, creating a gel that helps to soften and bulk stool. Insoluble fibers mildly irritate the intestinal lining, which stimulates the secretion of water and mucus to encourage movement of stool. [26] Certain fibers act as prebiotics, or food for gut bacteria, which ferments fibers into short chain fatty acids and increases water in the intestines to produce softer, easier-to-pass stools. [26]
Because of the differing actions of various fiber types with constipation, a range of high-fiber foods from whole grains, fruits, legumes, and vegetables is recommended. It is suggested to increase fiber intake gradually, because a sudden significant increase in dietary fiber can cause bloating and cramping. Drinking more fluids while eating more fiber can also help lessen these side effects.
Diverticulosis is a condition in which small ‚Äúpouches‚Äù called diverticula develop in the lower intestine. It is one of the most common disorders of the colon in the Western world, with the highest rates in the U.S. and Europe. [17] The risk of developing diverticulosis increases with age (more than half of people over age 60 have diverticula) and is usually silent, not causing noticeable symptoms unless the pouches tear or become inflamed, leading to diverticulitis. Diverticulitis can cause persistent abdominal pain (usually in the lower left side), nausea, vomiting, and fever. Treatment is typically a brief period of no food, drinking liquids only, and antibiotic medications. In severe cases where an abscess or perforation may develop, surgery may be needed. However, most people who develop diverticulosis will not develop diverticulitis, with more recent studies estimating only 5% progressing to diverticulitis. [18]
Research shows that a Westernized diet low in fiber and high in red meat and ultra-processed refined foods is a major contributor. [19-21] An eating pattern such as this can lead to constipation, which over time weakens the colon muscles while increasing pressure when trying to defecate; small pouches can form within these weak spots. It can also lead to an increase in harmful intestinal bacteria, causing inflammation and further increasing the risk of diverticular disease. [17,20]
Large cohort studies show a protective effect of fiber on diverticular disease, particularly fibers from fruits, cereal grains, and vegetables. [22,23] A cohort of more than 43,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found a protective effect of dietary fiber from diverticulitis, especially cellulose, a type of insoluble fiber. [24] Cellulose is found in the skins of fruits, leafy vegetables, root vegetables, legumes, and wheat bran. A Nurses‚Äô Health Study following more than 50,000 women found that those with the highest fiber intakes (25 or more grams daily) had a 13% lower risk of diverticulitis than those who ate the least (less than 18 grams daily). [2] The protective effect came especially from fibers from cereal grains and whole fruits, but not fruit juices.
Other factors that increase the risk of diverticular disease are increasing age, smoking, lack of exercise, use of certain medications (NSAIDs, steroids, aspirin, opioids), family history, and history of irritable bowel syndrome. [18]
Although the role of diet with diverticular disease has long been debated, a high-fiber intake with a focus on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables has been found to have a strong association with decreased risk of diverticular disease and diverticulitis. [18] When it comes to nuts and popcorn, research following more than 47,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study actually found alowerrisk of diverticulitis when eating these foods. [25] Including these foods also did not increase the risk of developing new diverticulosis or diverticular complications.
There are many types of dietary fibers that come from a range of plant foods. It‚Äôs important to not hyperfocus on a particular fiber because of its specific proposed action, as each type offers some level of health benefit. Therefore, eating a wide variety of plant foods likefruits,vegetables,whole grains,legumes,nuts, and seeds to reach the fiber recommendation of 25-35 grams daily best ensures reaping those benefits.

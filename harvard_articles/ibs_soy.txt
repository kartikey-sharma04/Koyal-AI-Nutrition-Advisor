üîó Probiotics for Gut Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/probiotics/

Probiotics‚Äîwhether from food or supplements‚Äîare a hot topic of consumer interest. However, would a relatively healthy person benefit from supplementation of probiotics, or is a fiber-rich diet sufficient for cultivating a robust gut microbiome? Learn more about probiotics, and review available research on supplements and health.
Probiotics are dubbed the ‚Äúgood gut bugs‚Äù that live in our digestive tract. They include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes that make up what we callthe gut microbiome. Each person‚Äôs microbiome is different, influenced by what we eat, our lifestyle habits, our genes, and environment. Although studies have shown that the types and amounts of gut bugs differ between healthy individuals and those with disease, and that many health experts believe that a diversity of bacteria in the colon is beneficial, what a healthy gut microbiome looks like is still unknown, as it would likely vary from person to person.
However, there are known probiotics that live in the human intestine, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Bifidobacterium. TheWorld Health Organization defines probioticsas ‚Äúlive microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.‚ÄùEarly research on probioticsused nonharmful bacteria to change or replace intestinal microbes in patients who had intestinal disorders or diarrhea.
Prebiotics consist of non-digestible fermentable carbohydrates that act as food for probiotics. An example is oligofructose naturally found in wheat, onions, banana, garlic, leeks, and chicory root or inulin. The fermentation of prebiotics by gut bacteria may help increase the amount of beneficial bacteria strains in the colon, prevent the growth of potential pathogens, reduce constipation, support healthy immune function, and lower blood cholesterol levels.
Synbioticsare supplements that contain a mix of probiotics and prebiotics, with the intention that the bacterial strains are fed and thrive in the gut.Postbioticsare the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù made by gut bacteria after digesting prebiotic fibers, which can include beneficial short-chain fatty acids and vitamin K.
These are terms promoted by industry, as they are marketed as supplements alongside probiotics. However, at this time there is little quality scientific evidence supporting the use of prebiotic, symbiotic, and postbiotic supplements to improve health.
Probiotics can be found naturally in or added to certain foods and beverages, and are sold as supplements.
Foods that are fermented tend to contain probiotics, such as:
However, to cultivate a robust gut microbiome, rather than adding just these foods to your diet, focus on implementing a long-term dietary pattern rich in various types of fibers fromfruits, vegetables,whole grains,beans,nuts, and seeds that act as prebiotics.
Fermented foods are foods or beverages that are produced with the intentional, controlled growth of microorganisms with the conversion of food components by enzymes. Historically, fermentation was commonly used to preserve foods as it protected the food from contamination by pathogenic bacteria. It also imparts a unique taste and texture to foods created by the specific types of bacteria used. Certain foods like olives are inedible without fermentation that removes bitter compounds. Fermented foods may benefit the gut microbiome, promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, and support ahealthy immune system.
Processing of fermented foods, such as by heating, baking, or pasteurization, reduces or kills probiotics. So popular foods like sourdough bread and commercially prepared fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut do not contain probiotics unless they have been added back (the label may state ‚Äúcontains live and active cultures‚Äù). Additionally, theInternational Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics statethat the term ‚Äúprobiotic‚Äù should not be used interchangeably with ‚Äúfermented foods.‚Äù Instead, fermented foods should be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù only when there is evidence that the live microbes provide health benefits.For example, yogurt is a fermented food but should only be labeled as ‚Äúcontaining probiotics‚Äù if the bacterial strains used in its production have been shown to provide health benefits.
You may be surprised to see probiotics advertised on packages of chocolate, cookies, juices, and tea as the food industry has cashed in on growing consumer interest in digestive health and probiotic supplements by conveniently including them in common foods and beverages.
Be wary ofultraprocessed foodsadvertising on front of label, ‚Äúincludes probiotics (or prebiotics) to support digestive health.‚Äù This addition may create a favorable impression of their nutritional value but does not make brownies and chips suddenly healthful. Manufacturers also tend to choose familiar-sounding bacterial strains that a consumer will recognize and be more likely to purchase.
There is overwhelming scientific evidence of the harmful health effects ofsoda and sugary drinks. While soda intake has declined, sodas containing prebiotics have surged in popularity, thanks to the inclusion ofa fiber called inulinand growing consumer interest in gut health. Inulin is naturally found in small amounts in fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, artichokes, and asparagus. But the type found in ultra-processed foods is usually extracted from chicory root and blended into sweet foods like brownies, yogurt, nutrition bars ‚Äì and now sodas. These sodas are sweetened with sugar but contain much less than traditional sodas per 12-ounces: about 4-5 grams compared with 40 grams in a cola drink. A soda lower in sugar and containing fiber, especially a fiber type that boasts ‚Äúprebiotics for gut health‚Äù is surely attractive to a consumer. However, it is unproven that the small amount of prebiotics in these sodas will truly improve gut health, and drinking more of them daily to potentially achieve gut health also drives up sugar intake. In fact, aclass action lawsuit was filed in 2024against one of these soda manufacturers due to false health claims.
The best use for these prebiotic sodas might be to replace a traditional soda if you‚Äôre trying to wean down and lower sugar intake. But they should not be viewed as a health beverage, and remember that the more you drink, the sugar will add up. Check outHealthy Drinksfor best beverage options.
In 2013, global sales of probiotic supplements was $32 billion, and ispredicted to reach $85 billion by 2027.
In 2020, the International Scientific Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics expanded the definition of probiotics marketed as supplements to include their genus, species, strain, alphanumeric strain designation, and commercial name. For example:
‚Ä†¬†The inclusion of this brand-name is for reference only and does not constitute an endorsement. The Nutrition Source does not endorse specific brands.
Thesupplement industryas a whole is fraught with uncertainties: the quality of products from different sources can vary, and supplement manufacturers do not always have quality control programs in place. Sometimes a probiotic supplement contains lower than the stated dose of bacterial strains or may even contain different types of strains than are listed.
The quality of probiotic supplements depends on the manufacturer.Important factors includean assurance of potency (ensuring live bacteria in the amounts listed, typically in colony-forming units [CFU] through the end of shelf-life), purity (manufacturing processes that reduce the introduction of harmful pathogens), and identity (current nomenclature used to specify the genus, species, and subspecies, if applicable, and a strain designation for each strain in the product). Live probiotics are susceptible to dying during storage, which manufacturers account for when listing the potency and CFU. Responsible manufacturers will include the dose expected at the use-by date.
There is tremendous interest in the use of probiotic supplements to treat various health conditions or for boosting immunity. As a consumer, you may see attractive claims of health benefits on supplement labels, but be wary as good-quality scientific evidence is still limited and conflicting as to which strains benefit which health conditions, effective doses, single versus multi-strain types, and an optimal length of time to use them. It can be difficult to disentangle scientific evidence from enticing marketing claims.
Probiotic supplements are backed by a billion-dollar industry that often funds published research that shows positive findings about their specific bacterial strain(s). Even if studies, particularly meta-analyses, do not show author disclosures of conflicts of interest, this does not guarantee there are not embedded financial ties. Do not be surprised if your physician or health care practitioner does not recommend probiotic supplements, which is based on low-quality evidence on their efficacy.
Due to lack of high-quality evidence and a largely unregulated supplement industry, buyer beware should be heeded. TheAmerican Gastroenterological Association released practice guidelines in 2020on probiotic supplements to manage gastrointestinal disorders, and concluded only a few conditions in which they may benefit.They determined that drawing conclusions on probiotic research is difficult due to studies including different strains of microbes used, different doses, and different routes of administration, as well as differences in how the study was conducted and including only small numbers of patients followed for short periods.
That said, research is ongoing and some people find benefit in taking probiotic supplements for specific conditions in the short-term. Multi-strain types (more than one bacterial strain in the supplement) have not necessarily been found more effective than single-strain types. The following conditions have shown low-quality evidence for probiotic use:
As a rule, always discuss supplement use, including probiotics, with your doctor.
There are several species of microbes such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that are naturally found in the human colon and considered to be safe (not pathogenic). However, people who have weakened immune systems, are taking immunosuppressant drugs, or have severe disease conditions should not use probiotic supplements, because in specific cases they have beenassociated with harmful overgrowth or led to health complications.
Probiotics have skyrocketed in consumer popularity. However, there is often industry funding for probiotic research, which can skew results in favor of using the supplements. Despite the hype, there exists mostly low-quality evidence for probiotic supplements. A relatively healthy person would not likely benefit from their use, and those with weakened immune systems should avoid them.
Research is ongoing, and the decision to use supplements should be preceded with caution, with an awareness that there is a level of ‚Äúmanufactured importance‚Äù created by industry. General recommendations for probiotics cannot be made, and people should not use them loosely, because each person‚Äôs gut microbiome is unique with different bacterial strains that are optimal for them.
Because the safety and effectiveness of probiotic supplements is unclear, theWorld Gastroenterology Organisation recommendsthat if clinicians advise probiotic supplements to patients, the strains, doses, and length of use should only be that of those used in human trials that were shown to be beneficial.However, most consumers and doctorsdo not have access to or the abilityto sort through probiotics research, to be able to differentiate among various probiotics products.
A safer natural way tocultivate a healthy gut microbiomeis to implement a dietary pattern that includes a variety of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes that will ‚Äúfeed‚Äù favorable gut bugs. This can include fermented foods that naturally contain probiotics.

üîó Understanding Food Labels
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-label-guide/

The information on food labels is intended to help consumers become savvy about their food choices. The front, back, and sides of a package are filled with information to inform us what the food contains and to provide guidance in making healthier selections of processed foods. However, all the numbers, percentages, and sometimes complex-sounding ingredients can lead to more confusion than clarity.
This guide will help you to navigate the terminology and nutrition information on a food package to ensure that you know what you‚Äôre buying.
The Nutrition Facts label is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and was first mandated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 to help consumers make quick, informed food choices. It has undergone revisions, with thelatest update released in 2016. Changes are generally based on updated scientific information and input from the public regarding ease of use.
The percent Daily Value (%DV) shows how much of a nutrient in one serving of food contributes to one‚Äôs approximate daily requirement for the nutrient. To best use the %DV, remember these simple guidelines:
For more commentary on the updated Nutrition Facts label by Harvard nutrition experts, see the article,Updated Nutrition Facts Panel makes significant progress with ‚Äúadded sugars,‚Äù but there is room for improvement.
This is the section of a food label consumers see first, which within seconds can influence their purchase. This has made it a battleground between public health advocates and food manufacturers. Food manufacturers can choose to display FOP symbols or graphics that highlight nutritional aspects of the product if they are favorable to health, such as being lower in calories or added sugar, but may leave out less favorable information such as being high in sodium or saturated fat. These graphics promote a perception of healthfulness, which can be misleading if consumers rely only on these images without reading the Nutrition Facts panel for complete information. The FDA does not closely monitor these FOP graphics. Because research has shown that ‚Äúpositive‚Äù FOP labels like health stamps or checkmarks can overrate a food‚Äôs healthfulness, public health advocates have supported initiatives for FOP ‚Äúwarning‚Äù labels (e.g., traffic lights or stop signs) to highlight nutrients that are harmful to health in excess, such as sugars and fats insweetened beveragesandultra-processed snacks. All FOP labels in the U.S. are voluntary, which allows food manufacturers to highlight or hide the nutrition information they choose to help promote or preserve sales. If warning labels became mandatory, as public health advocates propose, the pressure on manufacturers would increase to change certain products to improve their nutritional quality.
These are statements reviewed by the FDA and supported by scientific evidence that suggest certain foods or diets may lower the risk of a disease or health-related condition. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 regulates these health claims, which must undergo review by the FDA through a petition process. The FDA has approved12 health claimson food labels such as the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis; sodium and hypertension; fiber-containing grains, fruits and vegetables and cancer; and folic acid and neural tube defects. However, just because a food contains a specific nutrient that is associated with a decreased risk of disease does not necessarily make the food healthy as a whole. An example would be a breakfast cereal high in soluble fiber for heart health but that is also high in added sugars. Research finds that consumers believe that a food carrying a health claim is healthier than a product that does not.
These statements describe the nutrients in a food beyond what is listed on the Nutrition Facts label, intended to showcase a health benefit of the food. An example is ‚ÄúContains 100% Vitamin C.‚Äù Most terms like ‚Äúlow sodium,‚Äù ‚Äúhigh fiber,‚Äù ‚Äúreduced fat,‚Äù and ‚Äúgood source of‚Äù are regulated by the FDA, and the nutrient amounts must meetspecific guidelinesto make these claims. Also regulated are comparative terms like ‚Äúless sugar‚Äù or ‚Äúfewer calories‚Äù comparing two similar products. However, these statements can mislead consumers about their overall healthfulness. For example, a bag of potato chips may advertise that it has 40% less fat and is cholesterol-free, suggesting it is a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù food, when in reality even a ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù potato chip is still a high-calorie ultra-processed food offering little nutrition. Some terms are not yet regulated by the FDA such as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or ‚Äúmultigrain.‚Äù As another example, see the pros and cons of health labeling forWhole Grains.
Chile implemented the Law of Food Labeling and Advertising in 2016, comprised of mandatory front-of-package (FOP) warning labels, restrictions on child-directed marketing, and the banning of sales in schools of all foods and beverages containing added sugars, sodium, or saturated fats that exceeded set nutrient or calorie thresholds. [1] The FOP labels displayed a black stop sign that used warning words of ‚Äúhigh in‚Ä¶‚Äù followed by sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories. Later analyses found that purchases of sweetened beverages significantly declined following the implementation of this multifaceted law that was more effective than prior single initiatives (i.e., sweetened beverages tax).
Opposition by food industries in other countries is strong toward warning labels such as these. [2] In the United States, in 2011 the FDA recommended a FOP graphic of stars or checkmarks that indicated a less healthful versus healthful food choice. [3] In response, the Grocery Manufacturers Association intercepted this project by introducing the FOP label ‚ÄúFacts Up Front,‚Äù which displays certain nutrient amounts of a processed food. There was criticism due to its voluntary nature so that manufacturers of less healthful foods could simply choose not to display it. Opposers also noted that simply listing the nutrient amounts would not necessarily help a consumer to know if it was a healthful choice if they were unsure what the amounts meant (as opposed to the FDA‚Äôs stars and checks system that provided straightforward guidance on a healthful versus less healthful choice). Regardless, soon after initiation of the Facts Up Front label, the FDA discontinued their labeling project while continuing to monitor the Facts Up Front system.
The FDA oversees the ingredients listed on food labels. A packaged food must list the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. In other words, the ingredients that weigh the most are listed first. The list may contain unfamiliar terms alongside the common ingredient names. These may be added preservatives or colors (e.g., sodium bisulfite, caramel color), thickeners or emulsifiers (e.g., guar gum, carrageenan), or the scientific names of vitamins and minerals (e.g., ascorbic acid, alpha tocopherol). Ingredients like added sugars may carry many alternative names but are essentially varying combinations of fructose and glucose: evaporated cane juice, high fructose corn syrup, agave nectar, honey, brown sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup, molasses, and turbinado sugar.
Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, eight major food allergens‚Äîmilk, fish, tree nuts, peanuts, shellfish, wheat, eggs, and soybeans‚Äîare required to be listed in a ‚Äúcontains‚Äù statement near the Ingredients list if present in a food. An example would be ‚Äúcontains wheat, milk, and soy.‚Äù Advisory statements addressing cross-contamination may also be listed such as ‚Äúmay contain wheat‚Äù or ‚Äúproduced in a facility that also uses peanuts.‚Äù On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research (FASTER) Act became law, declaring sesame as the 9th major food allergen recognized in the US. Sesame will be a required allergen listing as of January 1, 2023.
Other potential allergens include gluten and color additives such as FD&C Yellow No. 5. The FDA mandates that a product containing FD&C Yellow No. 5 must identify it on the food label. The term ‚Äúgluten-free‚Äù can be listed on a label if it meets a specific maximum amount of gluten as defined by the FDA.
These dates found on food products inform both the seller and consumer about the shelf-life and optimal quality of the product. They are determined by the food manufacturer‚Äôs judgment for peak quality. Foods can still be eaten safely after these dates, with the exact amount of time dependent on the food product, but the flavor and texture may begin to deteriorate. These expiration dates are not required by federal law though some states may institute their own requirements.

üîó Lectins
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/anti-nutrients/lectins/

Lectins, or hemagglutinins, are an ‚Äúanti-nutrient‚Äù that have received much attention due to popular media and fad diet books citing lectins as a major cause for obesity, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. They are found in all plants, but rawlegumes(beans,lentils, peas, soybeans, peanuts) and whole grains like wheat contain the highest amounts of lectins. Is there truth behind these claims?
Lectins are defined as proteins that bind to carbohydrates. The same features that lectins use to defend plants in nature may cause problems during human digestion. They resist being broken down in the gut and are stable in acidic environments, features that protect lectin-containing plants in nature. [1]
When consumed, lectins in their active state can cause negative side effects. The most publicized accounts report severe reactions in people eating even small amounts of raw or undercooked kidney beans. They contain phytohaemagglutinin, a type of lectin that can cause red blood cells to clump together. It can also produce nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, and diarrhea. [2] Milder side effects include bloating and gas.
Animal and cell studies have found that active lectins can interfere with the absorption of minerals, especiallycalcium,iron,phosphorus, andzinc. Legumes and cereals often contain these minerals, so the concurrent presence of lectins may prevent the absorption and use of these minerals in the body. Lectins can also bind to cells lining the digestive tract. This may disrupt the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, and affect the growth and action of intestinal flora. Because lectin proteins bind to cells for long periods of time, they can potentially cause an autoimmune response and are theorized to play a role in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. [2,3]
These theories have fueled the profitable anti-lectin movement, spawning bestselling books and enzyme supplements to prevent lectin activity in the body. However, there is very limited research in humans on the amount of active lectins consumed in the diet and their long-term health effects. Anti-nutrients including lectins are most often studied in the diets of developing countries where malnutrition is prevalent, or where food variety is very limited and whole grains and legumes are important daily staples. [4,5]
It is important to remember that eating foods with a high amount of active lectins is rare. One reason is that lectins are most potent in their raw state, and foods containing them are not typically eaten raw. Cooking, especially with wet high-heat methods like boiling or stewing, or soaking in water for several hours, can inactivate most lectins. [6] Lectins are water-soluble and typically found on the outer surface of a food, so exposure to water removes them.
An example is dried beans. To prepare them for eating, they are soaked for several hours and then boiled for several more hours to soften the bean, which disables the action of lectins. Canned beans are cooked and packaged in liquid, so they are also low in lectins. However, raw beans simmered at low heat such as in a slow-cooker or undercooking the beans will not remove all the lectins.
The body can produce enzymes during digestion that degrades some lectins. Other processes that deactivate the compounds are sprouting grains and beans, and mechanically removing the outer hull of beans and wheat grains that contain the most lectins.
There are different types of lectins in different foods, and the reactions people have to them vary widely. It is possible that one who has an underlying digestive sensitivity, such as irritable bowel syndrome, may be more likely to experience negative symptoms from eating lectins and otheranti-nutrients. Because the reported symptoms of lectin sensitivity are recognizable with physical discomfort, a reasonable solution may be to eat less of or less often the foods that cause digestive problems.
Lectins can act as anantioxidant, which protects cells from damage caused by free radicals. They also slow down digestion and the absorption ofcarbohydrates, which may prevent sharp rises in blood sugar and high insulin levels. Early research is also looking at the use of non-toxic low amounts of certain lectins to help stimulate gut cell growth in patients who are unable to eat for long periods, and in anticancer treatments due to the ability of lectins to cause cancer cell death. [2,6-7]
In many large population studies, lectin-containing foods likelegumes,whole grains, andnutsare associated with intentional weight loss and lower rates of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. [8-11] These foods are rich sources ofB vitamins,protein,fiber, and minerals, andhealthy fats. Thus, the health benefits of consuming these foods far outweigh the potential harm of lectins in these foods.

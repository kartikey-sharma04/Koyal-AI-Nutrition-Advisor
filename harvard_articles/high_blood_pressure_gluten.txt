üîó Precision Nutrition
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/precision-nutrition/

Precision nutrition may sound like a new fad diet, but it is actually a credible emerging area of research supported by the National Institutes of Health under the umbrella of precision medicine. [1,2] Precision medicine seeks to improve the personalized treatment of diseases, and precision nutrition is specific to dietary intake. Both develop interventions to prevent or treat chronic diseases based on a person‚Äôs unique characteristics like DNA, race, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Both aim to provide safer and more effective ways to prevent and treat disease by providing more accurate and targeted strategies. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another. How often are we tempted to follow a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or ‚Äúcure‚Äù their diabetes? The concept of precision nutrition would discourage this practice, as our individual blueprint might require a unique dietary plan to be successful.
Precision nutrition also considers themicrobiome, trillions of bacteria in our bodies that play a key role in various daily internal operations. What types and how much bacteria we have are unique to each individual. Our diets can determine which types of bacteria live in our digestive tracts, and according to precision nutrition the reverse is also true: the types of bacteria we house might determine how we break down certain foods and what types of foods are most beneficial for our bodies.
Precision nutrition, also referred to as personalized nutrition, focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases. Yet, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals. [3] The person‚Äôs microbiome was found to cause variations in blood triglycerides after a meal. Non-food factors like sleep, physical activity, and time of meals also played a role in causing variations in blood levels of glucose and triglycerides after meals. [3] Therefore, an individual may see additional benefits if following personalized nutrition guidance beyond general health recommendations. Precision nutrition evaluates one‚Äôs DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease.
There are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: agluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU). However precision nutrition is in its early stages and too soon to introduce as a treatment for chronic diseases in the general population. Research is being conducted on the application of precision nutrition for obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, and type 2diabetes(T2DM).
For example, the traditional management of T2DM targets healthy lifestyle factors (exercise,diet, achieving ahealthy weight), often with use of medications. Precision nutrition can further tailor diabetes management by looking closely at the following areas: [4,5]
Precision nutrition examines how a person‚Äôs DNA may be associated with their response to a food. One example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup?Coffeebeans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content. Research has discovered genes specifically related to coffee intake. [6] These genes may determine how fast or slowly the caffeine in coffee is metabolized. They are also associated with anti-inflammatory effects and a lower risk of certain chronic diseases. Precision nutrition uses genetic data such as this to determine if an individual would benefit from drinking more or less coffee.
Other factors being researched include seeing if a high intake of saturated fat may predispose an individual to weight gain, or if a high salt intake increases one‚Äôs risk of developing high blood pressure. [7] However, findings from these studies have not been replicated in different populations.
The field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges‚Äîa lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual‚Äôs DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. [4] Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease. There may also be differences among findings in clinical trials of the individual metabolic response to a specific diet depending on the types of tests they use; this in turn could cause variation in the personalized nutrition recommendations that are provided.
Primary care physicians, registered dietitians, and other providers directly interacting with an individual need to be educated about precision nutrition, as it requires the combined joint efforts of the entire health care team. Despite individual differences in metabolic response to foods, personalized dietary advice should still align with general nutrition principles (e.g. eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming less added sugar from sugary drinks, limiting sodium, etc.). Although private companies have started to offer genetic and microbiome testing to the public to customize diets, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests.
Ethical and legal aspects of implementing precision nutrition should also be considered, including protecting consumer privacy in the use of precision nutrition technologies and tests. It‚Äôs also important to recognize that personalized approaches may be accessible to only a small segment of the population, which can widen health disparities. We must not lose sight of improving the broader food environment through effective policies, regulations, and other population-based approaches that can help make healthy food choices the default.

üîó Rice
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/rice/

Rice is a main staple in more than 100 countries worldwide. [1] In some households, rice is included with more than one meal a day. This starchy high-calorie grain is generally low cost, making it accessible to all and a vital base of many diets. Each country showcases a rice specialty to reflect local spices and taste preferences: risotto in Italy, paella in Spain, jambalaya in the southern U.S., coconut rice in Colombia, steamed rice in China, rice and beans in Mexico, and sweet rice in Portugal, to name a few.
The scientific name for rice isOryza. Oryza sativais the most common species and is subdivided into the long-grainindica, and short-grainjaponica. Tools for farming rice have been found in China dating back 8000 years. Merchant traders helped the gradual spread of rice across the continents.
(*primarilywhole grainvarieties)
There are thousands of types ofOryza sativa, which can differ in size, thickness, stickiness, color, aroma, and flavor. Rice is often broadly categorized based on its shape or method of processing:
This refers to the length and width of the rice grain after cooking:
Is the rice in its whole, intact form (like ‚Äúbrown‚Äù rice), or has it been milled and polished (like ‚Äúwhite‚Äù rice)?
Of course, when it comes to cooking, specific varieties of rice are often chosen for their unique characteristics. Here are a few popular types:
Because large amounts of rice are eaten in some countries, along with an increasing worldwide prevalence oftype 2 diabetesand insulin resistance, rice intake‚Äôs effect on health has been studied.
The glycemic index(GI) is a measure of how quickly and how much a food raises one‚Äôs blood sugar levels after eating. Rice is considered a high GI food but it varies depending on the type and amount of processing (processing increases the GI). Reports show the GI of rice ranging from 48-93. [2] Low GI foods have a rating of 55 or less, medium GI foods are 56-69, and high GI foods are 70-100. The average GI for brown rice is low at 55, whereas the GI for white rice is higher at 64. [3] Observational studies have found an association between a high GI diet and greater risk for type 2 diabetes.
The message of these studies was consistent with public health recommendations to replace refined grains with whole grains, and to choose at least two servings of whole grains a day to reduce type 2 diabetes risk.
In a large cohort study of 71,750 women from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and 42,823 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, intakes of brown rice did not lower the risk of ischemic stroke. [6] However, intakes of brown rice in this group were generally lower than intakes of other grain foods that did decrease stroke risk like whole grain cereals and bran. A systematic review of 45 studies on whole grains did not find a reduced risk of stroke, heart disease, or cancer from intakes of either white or brown rice. [7]
Arsenic is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in soil, rock, and water. The term ‚Äútotal arsenic‚Äù includes organic and inorganic arsenic compounds. Organic arsenic is found mostly in seafood and is considered less toxic. Inorganic arsenic is toxic and found in soil, groundwater, and industrial chemicals. Though a high amount of inorganic arsenic is deadly, long-term exposure to lower levels is also concerning as it may increase the risk of various diseases.
In 2012, reports surfaced about the potentially high levels of inorganic arsenic in rice. [8] The amount in our food supply results largely from contaminated groundwater and soil from livestock manure, fertilizer, pesticides, and industrial waste. [9] This is concerning to individuals who eat rice daily. Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term exposure to arsenic can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Exposure to arsenic at young ages has been linked to certain cancers and neurological defects. [1]
Arsenic accumulates in rice 10 times more than in other grains due to being cultivated in water-flooded fields, where irrigation water as well as the soil may be contaminated with arsenic. [10] The rice grain easily absorbs arsenic into its roots through water. In the U.S., rice grown in southern states contains high amounts of arsenic because of residual metals in the soil from the historical use of arsenic-laced pesticides to treat cotton crops. Rice products such as rice cereal and rice crackers may also contain high levels of arsenic. The amount of arsenic in other types of rice such as black or red depends on the exact species and the amount of inorganic arsenic in the soil and water supply, which can vary greatly by region.
There is no federal limit for arsenic in food and beverages other than water. The standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion (ppb). One report found as much as 193 ppm in brown rice grown in the southern U.S. [2] A later report by the FDA also found high levels with an average concentration of 154 ppb in brown rice. [11]
Early life exposure to arsenic increases the risk of negative health effects later in life. Non-profit organizations have pushed for federal standards limiting the amount of arsenic in the food supply. Congress introduced a bill in 2012 called the RICE Act (Reducing food-based Inorganic and Organic Compounds Exposure Act) to establish limits on the amount of total arsenic allowed in rice and rice products. [12] In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drafted a proposed limit of 100 ppb in infant rice cereal and juice, but further action by the FDA or voluntary standards by manufacturers have not been established. [13] The FDA advised that parents give infants a variety of fortified cereals other than rice such as oat, barley, and multigrain. Pregnant women and toddlers should also eat a variety of whole grains other than rice. [14]
Additional ways to reduce arsenic exposure from rice:
If you eat brown rice or brown rice products frequently or more than four times a week, consider purchasing brands grown in non-polluted regions (such as California as opposed to Arkansas or Texas).

üîó Diet Review: Paleo Diet for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/paleo-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The Paleolithic or ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù diet seeks to address 21stcentury ills by revisiting the way humans ate during the Paleolithic era more than 2 million years ago. Paleo proponents state that because our genetics and anatomy have changed very little since the Stone Age, we should eat foods available during that time to promote good health. Our predecessors used simple stone tools that were not advanced enough to grow and cultivate plants, so they hunted, fished, and gathered wild plants for food. If they lived long enough, they were believed to experience less modern-day diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease because of a consistent diet of lean meats and plant foods along with a high level of physical activity from intensive hunting. However, the life expectancy of our predecessors was only a fraction of that of people today.
The popularity of the Paleo diet, which hit a peak in 2014, appealed to consumers‚Äô increasing desire to eat more healthfully and to know where their food was coming from. [1]
The Paleo diet, also referred to as the caveman or Stone-Age diet, includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Proponents of the diet emphasize choosinglow-glycemicfruits and vegetables. There is debate about several aspects of the Paleo diet: what foods actually existed at the time, the variation in diets depending on region (e.g., tropical vs. Arctic), how modern-day fruits and vegetables bear little resemblance to prehistoric wild versions, and disagreement among Paleo diet enthusiasts on what is included/excluded from the diet. Because of these differences, there is not one ‚Äútrue‚Äù Paleo diet.
For example, although white potatoes were recorded as being available during the Paleolithic era, they are usually avoided on the Paleo diet because of their high glycemic index. Processed foods are also technically off limits due to an emphasis on fresh foods, but some Paleo diets allow frozen fruits and vegetables because the freezing process preserves most nutrients.
Overall, the diet is high inprotein, moderate infat(mainly fromunsaturated fats), low-moderate incarbohydrate(specifically restricting highglycemic indexcarbohydrates), high infiber, and low in sodium and refined sugars. [2] The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (including the omega-3 fats EPA and DHA) come from marine fish, avocado, olive oil, and nuts and seeds.
Grass-fed beef is often highlighted on the diet, which is promoted to contain moreomega-3 fatsthan conventional beef (due to being fed grass instead of grain). It does contain small amounts of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, only a small proportion of ALA can be converted in the body to long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). The amount of omega-3 is also highly variable depending on the exact feeding regimen and differences in fat metabolism among cattle breeds. [3] In general, the amount of omega-3 in grass-fed beef is much lower than that in oily marine fish. [3] Cooked salmon contains 1000-2000 mg of EPA/DHA per 3-ounce portion, whereas 3 ounces of grass-fed beef contains about 20-200 mg of ALA.
Some randomized controlled trials have shown the Paleo diet to produce greater short-term benefits than diets based on national nutrition guidelines, including greater weight loss, reduced waist circumference, decreased blood pressure, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cholesterol. However these studies were of short duration (6 months or less) with a small number of participants (less than 40). [4-6]
One larger randomized controlled trial followed 70 post-menopausal Swedish women with obesity for two years, who were placed on either a Paleo diet or a Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) diet. [7] The Paleo diet provided 30% of total calories from protein, 40% fat (from mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and 30% carbohydrates. It included lean meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruits, berries, nuts, avocado, and olive oil. The NNR diet provided less protein and fat but more carbohydrate with 15% protein, 25-30% fat, and 55-60% carbohydrates, including foods similar to the Paleo diet but also low-fat dairy products and high-fiber grains. Both groups significantly decreased fat mass and weight circumference at 6 and 24 months, with the Paleo diet producing greater fat loss at 6 months but not at 24 months. Triglyceride levels decreased more significantly with the Paleo diet at 6 and 24 months than the NNR diet.
The Paleo diet includes nutrient-dense whole fresh foods and encourages participants to steer away from highly processed foods containing added salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. However, the omission of whole grains, dairy, and legumes could lead to suboptimal intake of important nutrients. The restrictive nature of the diet may also make it difficult for people to adhere to such a diet in the long run.¬† More high-quality studies including randomized controlled trials with follow-up of greater than one year that compare the Paleo diet with other weight-reducing diets are needed to show a direct health benefit of the Paleo diet. Strong recommendations for the Paleo diet for weight loss cannot be made at this time.

üîó Oats
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/oats/

Oats, formally namedAvena sativa, is a type of cereal grain from thePoaceaegrass family of plants. The grain refers specifically to the edible seeds of oat grass, which is what ends up in our breakfast bowls. Whether loved or hated for their mushy yet hearty texture when cooked, oats are most prized for their nutritional value and health benefits. The Food and Drug Administration allows the use of a health claim on food labels associating a reduced risk of coronary heart disease with the consumption of beta-glucan soluble fiber fromwhole grainoats. [1] Oatmeal is also a desired asset to those trying to lose weight and control hunger levels due to its high water and soluble fiber content.
Oats contain several components that have been proposed to exert health benefits. The primary type of soluble fiber in oats is beta-glucan, which has been researched to help slow digestion, increase satiety, and suppress appetite. Beta-glucan can bind with cholesterol-rich bile acids in the intestine and transport them through the digestive tract and eventually out of the body. Whole oats also contain plant chemicals called phenolic compounds and phytoestrogens that act as antioxidants to reduce the damaging effects of chronic inflammation that is associated with various diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. [2]
Because available research specific to oats is limited, most of the studies below assessed whole grain intake, which included several types of whole grains in addition to oats. Therefore, the findings cannot be applied to oats alone.

üîó Diet Reviews
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/

From bookstores to social media to blogs, there‚Äôs no shortage of information on diet. So how to differentiate what ‚Äúworks‚Äù from an overhyped fad?
It‚Äôs important to remember that even if a particular diet may be successful for one person, it may not be effective for another due to individual differences in genes and lifestyle.¬†And while research shows that calories matter,focusing on food qualityis an equally important part ofpreventing weight gainand promoting weight loss. Diets are also more likely to be successful when they are easier to follow, so tailoring a strategy to suit your own lifestyle is key.
Still, when faced with the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans, it helps to see what evidence is supporting them.In this series, we take a look at some popular diets and approaches to eating‚Äîand review the research behind them.

üîó Whole Grains
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/

Choose whole grains instead of refined grains.
Whole grains offer a ‚Äúcomplete package‚Äù of health benefits, unlike refined grains, which are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process.
All whole grain kernels contain three parts: the bran, germ, and endosperm. Each section houses health-promoting nutrients. The bran is thefiber-rich outer layer that suppliesB vitamins,iron, copper,zinc,magnesium,antioxidants, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals are natural chemical compounds in plants that have been researched for their role in disease prevention. The germ is the core of the seed where growth occurs; it is rich in healthy fats,vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants. The endosperm is the interior layer that holds carbohydrates, protein, and small amounts of some B vitamins and minerals.
These components have various effects on our bodies:
The invention of industrialized roller mills in the late 19th century changed the way we process grains. Milling strips away the bran and germ and leaves only the soft, easy-to-digest endosperm. Without the fibrous bran, the grain is easier to chew. The germ is removed because of its fat content, which can limit the shelf life of processed wheat products. The resulting highly processed grains are much lower in nutritional quality. Refining wheat creates fluffy flour that makes light, airy breads and pastries, but the process strips away more than half of wheat‚Äôs B vitamins, 90 percent of the vitamin E, and virtually all of the fiber. Although some nutrients may be added back by fortification, other health-promoting components of whole grains such as phytochemicals cannot be replaced.
A growing body of research shows that choosing whole grains and other less-processed, higher-quality sources of carbohydrates, and cutting back on refined grains, improves health in many ways. For a closer look at carbohydrates, check out ourCarbohydrate Guide.
The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 ounces of grain foods daily (based on a 2000-calorie diet) and getting at least half or 3 ounces of that grain intake from 100% whole grains. [1]¬†However, due to an increasing amount of research showing the various health benefits derived from whole grains, and even a possible detrimental effect when eating mostly refined grains, it is recommended to choose mostly whole grains instead of refined grains. An easy way to tell if a food product is high in 100% whole grains is to make sure it is listed first or second in the ingredient list. Or better yet, choose unprocessed whole grains:
Be careful when choosing foods labeled as whole grains: ‚ÄúWhole grain‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean healthy.
One study revealed that inconsistent food labeling means that foods identified as ‚Äúwhole grain‚Äù are not always healthy.¬†[2]
Consumers should steer towards whole grain foods that are high in fiber and that have few ingredients in addition to whole grain. Moreover, eating whole grains in their¬†whole¬†forms‚Äîsuch asbrown rice, barley,oats, corn, and rye‚Äîare healthy choices because they pack in the nutritional benefits of whole grains without any additional ingredients.
As researchers have begun to look more closely at carbohydrates and health, they are learning thatthe quality of the carbohydratesyou eat is at least as important as the quantity. Most studies, including some from several different Harvard teams, show a connection between whole grains and better health.¬†[3]
Cardiovascular disease
Eating whole instead of refined grains substantially lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin levels.
Type 2 diabetes
Replacing refined grains with whole grains and eating at least 2 servings of whole grains daily may help to reduce type 2 diabetes risk. The fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals in whole grains may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism and slow the absorption of food, preventing blood sugar spikes. [8]¬†In contrast, refined grains tend to have a high glycemic index and glycemic load with less fiber and nutrients.
Cancer
The data on cancer are mixed, with some studies showing a protective effect of whole grains and others showing none. [12,13]
Digestive health
By keeping the stool soft and bulky, the fiber in whole grains helps prevent constipation, a common, costly, and aggravating problem. It also helps prevent diverticular disease (diverticulosis) by decreasing pressure in the intestines.¬†[17]
Some grains contain the naturally-occurring protein, gluten. While gluten can cause side effects in certain individuals, such as those with celiac disease, most people can and have eaten gluten most of their lives‚Äîwithout any adverse reaction. However, negative media attention on wheat and gluten has caused some people to doubt its place in a healthful diet, though there is little published research to support such claims. For further information on gluten and health, see:Gluten: A Benefit or Harm to the Body?

üîó Protein
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/what-should-you-eat/protein/

Protein is an essential macronutrient, but not all food sources of protein are created equal, and you may not need as much as you think. Learn the basics about protein and shaping your diet with healthy protein foods.
Jump to:‚ÄìWhat is protein?‚ÄìHow much protein do I need?‚ÄìIt‚Äôs all about the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù‚ÄìResearch on protein and human health‚ÄìProtein foods and the planet‚ÄìThe bottom line: choosing healthy protein foods‚Äì[Quiz] Test your protein knowledge!
Protein is found throughout the body‚Äîin muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.
Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don‚Äôt store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids‚Äîhistidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine‚Äîknown as the¬†essential¬†amino acids, must come from food.
The National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, orjust over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. [1]
The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake‚Äîanywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there‚Äôs relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. Individual needs will vary based on factors such as age, exercise level, health conditions, and overall dietary pattern. A registered dietitian can help determine one‚Äôs individual protein needs.
In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.
‚ÄúPure‚Äù protein, whether derived from plant or animal foods, probably has similar effects on health, although the mix of amino acids can have health implications. Some proteins found in food are ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù meaning they contain all twenty-plus types of amino acids needed to make new protein in the body. Others are incomplete, lacking one or more of the nine essential amino acids, which our bodies can‚Äôt make from scratch or from other amino acids. Animal-based foods (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy foods) tend to be good sources of complete protein, while plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds) often lack one or more essential amino acid. Those who abstain from eating animal-based foods can eat a variety of protein-containing plant foods each day in order to get all the amino acids needed to make new protein, and also choose¬†to incorporate complete plant proteins likequinoaandchia seeds.
It‚Äôs important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don‚Äôt get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreasedimmunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death.
However, it‚Äôs uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there‚Äôs an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods. [3]
When we eat foods for protein, we also eat everything that comes alongside it: the different fats, fiber, sodium, and more. It‚Äôs this protein¬†‚Äúpackage‚Äù¬†that‚Äôs likely to make a difference for health.
The table below shows a sample of food ‚Äúpackages‚Äù sorted by protein content, alongside a range of components that come with it.
To call out a few examples:
Available evidence indicates that it‚Äôs¬†the source of protein (or, the protein ‚Äúpackage‚Äù), rather than the amount of protein, that likely makes a difference for our health. You can explore the research related to each disease in the tabs below, but here‚Äôs the evidence-based takeaway: eating healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat can lower the risk of several diseases and premature death.
Research conducted at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health has found that eating even small amounts of red meat‚Äîespecially processed red meat‚Äîon a regular basis is linked to an increased risk ofheart disease and stroke, and the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or any other cause. [4-6] Conversely, replacing red and processed red meat with healthy protein sources such as beans, soy foods, nuts, fish, or poultry seems to reduce these risks. One of the reasons why plant sources of protein are related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared to protein from red meat and dairy is because of thedifferent types of fatin these protein packages. Plant-based protein sources are more unsaturated, which lowers LDL cholesterol‚Äîan established risk factor for heart disease. Also, plant sources contain nocholesterol. Other factors are likely to contribute to the lower risk, but this is a key factor.
In terms of theamount¬†of proteinconsumed, there‚Äôs evidence that eating a relatively high-protein diet may be beneficial for the heart, as long as the protein comes from a healthy source.
Again, thesource of proteinmatters more than protein¬†quantity¬†when it comes to diabetes risk. Eating more red meat predicts a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, while consuming nuts, legumes, and poultry is related to lower risk.
When it comes to cancer, once again, thesource of proteinseems to matter more than quantity.
The same healthy protein foods that are good choices for disease prevention may also help with weight control. Again, it‚Äôs thesource of proteinthat matters.
There‚Äôs no need to go overboard on protein. Though some studies show benefits of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets in the short term (such as thepaleo diet), avoiding fruits and whole grains means missing out on healthful fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other phytonutrients.
To give you an idea, this ‚Äúscorecard‚Äù from the World Resources Institute illustrates the differing GHG emissions per gram of protein from both animal and plant-based protein foods. [25] Making just one pound (454 grams) of lamb generates five times more GHGs than making a pound of chicken¬†and around 30 times more than making a pound of lentils. [26] In the U.S. alone, beef accounts for 36% of all food-related GHG emissions. [27] Beyond emissions, it‚Äôs also important to note that food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination.
Protein is a key part of any diet. The average person needs about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight. Because protein is found in an abundance of foods, many people can easily meet this goal. However, not all protein ‚Äúpackages‚Äù are created equal. Because foods contain a lot more than protein, it‚Äôs important to pay attention to what else is coming with it. That‚Äôs why theHealthy Eating Plateencourages choosing healthy protein foods.
Building off this general guidance, here are some additional details and tips for shaping your diet with the best protein choices:

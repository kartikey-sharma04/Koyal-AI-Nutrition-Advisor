üîó Oral Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/

‚ÄúThere is no health without oral health.‚Äù You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.
Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth‚Äîparticularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person‚Äôs intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body‚Äôs process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body‚Äôs immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you‚Äôre having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn‚Äôt just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

üîó Cravings
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/cravings/

Most of us have experienced an intense urge to eat a certain food‚Äîideally right away. More often than not, that food is likely to be sugary, salty, or fatty, or all three. You may feel increasingly excited as you imagine how it will taste and how you‚Äôll feel eating it. Maybe you last ate several hours ago, or maybe you‚Äôre still digesting your last meal. These urges are called cravings, which can pop up at any moment, and aren‚Äôt always fueled by hunger pangs.
The terms ‚Äúsugar addict‚Äù or ‚Äúchocoholic‚Äù are often used, and people may blame cravings on a sweet tooth, bad eating habits, or lack of self-control. These may be true to a degree, but cravings actually involve a complex interplay of factors: brain messages, behaviors that become habits over time, and having easy access to food. Animal and human studies have shown that foods that stimulate the reward regions of the brain influence our food choices and eating behaviors. [1] When we eat certain foods, the neurons in the reward region become very active, creating highly positive feelings of pleasure so that we want to keep seeking these foods regularly. These foods are sometimes labeledhyperpalatablebecause they are easy to digest and have enjoyable qualities of sweetness, saltiness, or richness. Hyperpalatable foods can stimulate the release of metabolic, stress, and appetite hormones including insulin, cortisol, dopamine, leptin, and ghrelin, all of which play a role in cravings. [1]
Normally when eating a meal, appetite hormones are released. Examples are glucagon-like peptide and cholecystokinin from the digestive tract, and leptin from fat cells, which cause feelings of fullness and communicate with the brain to stop eating. On the flipside, if the body hasn‚Äôt received food for several hours, ghrelin is released from the stomach to signal hunger. Eating hyperpalatable foods too often might interfere with how the brain processes these hormonal signals so that one may feel continued cravings despite having eaten enough food. [1] Animal studies have shown that brain signals can become disrupted when eating a very high sugar or high fat diet, which may trigger the release of hormones that reduce stressful emotions and therefore lead to a habitual desire for these ‚Äúcomforting‚Äù foods. [2] Interestingly, human studies have also found associations with strong cravings andartificially sweetenedfoods and beverages (i.e., diet soda), as their intensely sweet flavor may produce the same rewarding effects as sugar. [3]
Although it‚Äôs pretty clear that certain foods have the ability to keep us coming back for more, it is less clear if food can be ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù in the same manner as drugs and alcohol. A food craving is an intense and persistent desire for a food, but that craving isn‚Äôt always for something delicious. It can also be caused by a nutritional deficiency, boredom, or self-imposed food restrictions. [4] A food addiction is one step beyond, including not only intense cravings but also exhibiting a loss of control of eating behaviors and repeated excess consumption of food, especially hyperpalatable foods. [6]
There is a lack of consensus if food addiction exists, or if some individuals who struggle to control their food intake can be considered food addicts. It remains a highly debated area. Some researchers argue that the defining features of drug and alcohol addiction are not seen with food addiction, while others feel they share similar traits related to neurological changes in the brain. [2,7,8]
Potential similarities of addictive substances and hyperpalatable foods in how they affect the brain: [4,9]
Animal studies have shown that hyperpalatable foods and addictive substances can cause imbalances in the brain‚Äôs reward system. ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù eating patterns are regulated by brain responses in the hypothalamus with the release of appetite hormones and chemicals so that one eats when hungry and stops when full. It is also believed that this reward system is overstimulated and disrupted so that a person may continually seek specific foods especially when feeling negative emotions like too much stress. [2] The repeated behavior over time of using hyperpalatable foods to produce pleasurable or calming emotions with the release of dopamine can condition the brain to seek out this response.
However, if there is a decreased response of the reward system (if, for example, less dopamine is secreted) one may experience less satisfaction after eating. As a result, one may eat larger amounts of hyperpalatable foods to try to achieve the same reward response. A similar effect, called tolerance, is seen with drug or alcohol addiction. Animal studies have shown that when cortisol is released with chronic stress, changes in the brain‚Äôs response can lead to lower dopamine levels and increased cravings. Stress has also been associated with increased levels of the hormone ghrelin, again causing stronger cravings.
High intakes of sugar have been studied to disrupt the body‚Äôs natural ability to sense hunger or satisfaction, so that people may keep eating despite being full, which can then alter the body‚Äôs natural homeostasis. [10] A review of clinical trials looking at the relationship of highly palatable sugary foods and negative emotions (stress, anxiety, depression, fear) found sugar to have addictive effects and cause changes in brain chemistry similar to other addictive substances, and the ability to produce negative withdrawal symptoms when stopping sugar intake. [2]
In his bookHooked, author Michael Moss questions what defines an addiction. Does it involve a substance that we repeatedly use (or eat) that has the potential to cause harm if taken excessively? [11] If so, then water might be considered an addiction, as we drink it daily and often crave it. If one drinks too much water, a dangerous condition called hyponatremia can result. Does an addiction involve taking a substance regularly that causes intense physical discomfort when stopping the substance? Then cocaine might not be considered an addiction, because although its withdrawal causes psychological symptoms, it does not cause physical symptoms as with alcohol. Determining an addiction is also complicated by the fact that signs and symptoms vary widely in individuals, based on their genes, body size, physical health, sex, and other factors.
According to the American Psychiatric Association‚ÄôsDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM),at least two criteria from the following are required for a diagnosis of addiction: cravings, tolerance (progressively needing higher amounts to experience reward), consuming more than intended, withdrawal, desire or unsuccessful efforts to quit use, a great deal of time spent in activities involved in use, continued use despite knowledge of problems associated with use, and interference with daily activities. [4]
The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize food addiction as an eating disorder or substance abuse disorder, but their DSM criteria were used as a basis for the creation of the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). [4] This scale is a validated measurement tool that identifies eating patterns that are similar to behaviors seen in classic areas of addiction. [12] Rather than just identifying overeating and cravings, the questions cover a range of behaviors, emotions (e.g., anxiety, agitation, distress), physical side effects (e.g., fatigue, withdrawal), and interference with daily work and social activities that are associated with eating certain types of foods.
A systematic review of all studies using the YFAS to assess food addiction found a prevalence of food addiction in almost 20% of the study population, with the highest rates in adult females older than 35 years and in participants with overweight/obesity. [13] Among those with a diagnosed eating disorder, the prevalence of food addiction was almost 58%. The most common symptom reported across all studies was ‚Äúpersistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down food intake.‚Äù The authors cautioned that the findings were not representative of a national population, as the main demographic in the studies sampled were females with overweight/obesity. A later systematic review with meta-analysis including 272 studies found a similar prevalence using the YFAS, with 20% of participants diagnosed with food addiction; 55% who were diagnosed with binge eating also had food addiction. [14] Patients who report binge eating tend to choose ultra-processed foods, commonly high in both carbohydrates and fats, and low in protein. [15] Research has shown that the specific combination of carbohydrate and fat activate the brain‚Äôs reward center associated with addictive behavior. [16]When looking at food addiction in higher-income regions in Latin American countries using the YFAS, the prevalence was about 15% of participants, and 38% in those who were diagnosed as overweight. [17]¬†In addition to using this scale to screen for individuals at risk for food addiction and diagnosable eating disorders, it may also be useful to identify any markers that show a progressive transition from impulsive eating events to compulsive eating behaviors to addictive behaviors. [4]
Snacks are big business and the food industry spends more than $10 billion yearly on snack food advertising. [18] Many snacks fall into the category of hyperpalatable foods that can stimulate brain reward pathways. These ‚Äúcraveable‚Äù foods include potato chips, crackers, ice cream, soda, candy, and fast food meals, with high amounts of sugar, salt, and fat that send messages to the brain to ‚Äúeat me!‚Äù. Just watching a 30-second television ad or seeing photos on social media of these delicious foods can spark cravings.
Many ads for unhealthy snack foods and beverages are directed towards children and are considered a key component in an environment that promotes overeating, poor dietary behaviors, and obesity. [19,20] Increased exposure to food advertising is associated with a higher calorie intake and increased preference for hyperpalatable foods from those ads. [21-23] Children have the highest exposures, because screen time through handheld devices has become a prevalent recreational activity whether it be television, social media, or online gaming. Surprisingly, educational websites also ranked in the top 10 for snack, sugary drink, fast food, and sugary cereal ads. [19]
Whereas acute sudden stress tends to suppress appetite, longer-lasting chronic stress isassociated with cravings for hyperpalatable high-fat calorie-dense foods. [24] Thisassociation may be caused by disturbances of messages to the brain that cause the release ofcortisol, which stimulates appetite and cravings. Read more about howchronic stress affectseating patterns.
Adequate sleep helps to regulate metabolic functions, and a lack of sleep is associated with imbalances in leptin and ghrelin levels. These hormonal fluctuations may lead to overeating due to cravings for sweet, starchy, high-fat, and salty foods. [25] Read more aboutsleep deficiency and eating behaviors.
Exercise typically lowers levels of appetite-stimulating ghrelin and increases appetite-suppressing leptin and glucagon-like peptide, at least in the short term. [26] However, there are several factors that can influence how much exercise affects one‚Äôs appetite. The longer the duration and the higher the intensity of a workout, the more likely one‚Äôs appetite shuts down, as blood is quickly moved away from the gut and to the heart and muscles to supply oxygen. [27] After exercising, normal hunger signaling gradually resumes. A shorter, less intense workout such as a moderate walk on a treadmill for 20 minutes may not have any effect on the appetite.
In women, hormones fluctuate during various phases of their menstrual cycle. When estrogen levels are low and progesterone is high, one may feel increased cravings and less satisfied after eating. The brain has receptors for estrogen, and higher levels of estrogen are associated with fullness and satisfaction after eating. [28] Estrogen also suppresses hunger by decreasing levels of ghrelin and increasing the effectiveness of cholecystokinin, an appetite-suppressing hormone. [29] Most research in this area has been with animal studies, but it is a topic of ongoing interest, especially in women who experience weight gain and who have low estrogen levels due to menopause or medical treatments that suppress estrogen (e.g., some chemotherapies).
In some people, drugs like antidepressants (e.g., sertraline, mirtazapine, paroxetine) and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine, aripiprazole) can increase appetite and weight. [30] The mechanism explaining why this happens isn‚Äôt clearly understood, but a change in metabolism and altered brain messages that signal appetite are suspected. These antidepressants interfere with the neurotransmitter serotonin, which regulates mood and appetite. Another medication that increases appetite is prednisone, a steroid sometimes given to replete low cortisol levels with certain health conditions. Prednisone can promote leptin resistance so that leptin does not work properly to suppress appetite, causing one to feel persistent hunger.

üîó Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 released
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2021/01/12/2020-dietary-guidelines/

The 9th edition of theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025is out, with the tagline toMake Every Bite Count. Intended for policy makers, healthcare providers, nutrition educators, and Federal nutrition program operators, the new edition has expanded to almost 150 pages, providing nutrition guidelines for even more age groups throughout the life cycle. As in theprevious edition, the Dietary Guidelines emphasize dietary patterns rather than promoting specific nutrients or foods. This allows for greater flexibility in food choices, as health benefits are achieved by consuming a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods across different food categories, rather than a few ‚Äúsuperfoods.‚Äù In addition, the Dietary Guidelines again emphasize how nutrition educators need to be aware that food choices are strongly impacted by age, race, cultural traditions, environment,food access,budget, and personal beliefs and preferences. [1]
The key players in the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern‚Äù remain unchanged from the previous edition of the Guidelines:
Dietary components to limit:
The guidelines carry over the same limits for saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, but this time include a specific age range:
While the Guidelines include dietary patterns that remain examples of healthy diets (‚ÄúHealthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealthy Vegetarian Pattern‚Äù), the dietary targets for the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Pattern‚Äù emphasize a diet relatively high in meat, eggs, and dairy foods. Dr.Walter Willett, Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said this about the new Guidelines:
In general, there was minimal change from the last edition of the Guidelines, which did include many positive suggestions. However, guidance that considers scientific evidence on specific protein sources and health, and also the environmental consequences of dietary patterns, is needed to provide Americans with advice and policies for healthy and sustainable diets. The current Dietary Guidelines fail to do this.
Like theprevious edition, the Guidelines are¬†silent on the environmental impacts of their dietary targets, which other analyses show would have serious impacts on climate change and other environmental footprints because of the relatively large amounts of meat and dairy foods recommended. [2] Along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. The production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods‚Äîand red meat (especially beef) and dairy stand out for their disproportionate impact.
Willett points out that the Guidelines‚Äô continued dairy recommendation of 3 servings¬†per day has never been justifiedby evidence for health outcomes, and the guidance for low-fat and fat-free dairy products doesn‚Äôt detail a plan for disposal of the fat naturally present in milk:
Because the disposal of dairy fat would be hugely wasteful, it would almost certainly remain in the food supply, which makes this recommendation somewhat of a fantasy. The report does appropriately mention thatsoymilk is an alternative to cow milk, but to avoid the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy food consumption at three servings per day, the majority of milk and dairy foods would need to beplant-based.
Similarly, the Guidelines also recommend lean meats, but don‚Äôt discuss the fate of cuts of meat that are not lean. Willett says that realistically,¬†they would almost certainly be consumed, ‚Äúprobably as cheap cuts and processed meats, especially by low-income groups who already experience excess rates of obesity and diabetes.‚Äù
It‚Äôs notable that the overall protein recommendation leads with ‚Äúlean meats,‚Äù which could be interpreted by consumers as including ‚Äúlean‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù cuts of bacon or other processed meats. Although further guidance clarifies that ‚Äúmost intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey) versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham, luncheon meats),‚Äù [1] this statement is buried within the chapters of the guidelines, rather than emphasized within the summarized protein recommendation. This is a particularly important distinction, since consuming healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat canlower the risk of several diseases and premature death.

üîó Strategies for Eating Well on a Budget
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/strategies-nutrition-budget/

An all-too-common mantra says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too expensive to eat healthy.‚Äù It‚Äôs true that when comparing specific foods like organic fruits with conventional fruits, the former tends to be a few dollars more per pound. And when a shopping cart filled with fresh produce, poultry, and fish is compared with one loaded with boxes of macaroni and cheese, ground hamburger meat, and cookies, the latter will likely ring lower at the cash register.
Certainly,policy improvements and other actionsare needed to create a food environment where the healthy choice is the easy and accessible choice. In the meantime, know that creating nutritious meals can be more affordable than one might think. In fact, one meta-analysis looking at the price difference between healthful and less healthful dietary patterns found that diets with healthier foods only cost a bit more‚Äîabout $1.48 per day. [1]
From the supermarket to the kitchen, here are some strategies to get the biggest nutrition bang for your buck.
Supermarket savings isn‚Äôt just about finding the cheapest sale items. It also means preventing impulse purchases that are caused by enticing food advertising or shopping on an empty stomach (that makes everything look delicious!).Food wasteis another money drain when food spoils before it is prepared or eaten and is thrown out. Consider the following tips before heading to the market:
A combination of fresh and processed foods can make up a healthful shopping list. Processed foods have their pros and cons but they shouldn‚Äôt be entirely labeled as unhealthy, since thedegree of processing and type of processingaffects nutrient content. For example, thanks to processing methods like freezing and canning, we can fill our freezers and stock our pantries with healthy staples like frozen fruits and vegetables, tinned fish, and canned beans. That said, when choosing canned or frozen foods, select options that do not include extra sodium, sugar, or other additives.
Here are some foods that are economical year-round and offer a wide range of nutrients including protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals:
With these staples in your culinary arsenal, you‚Äôre ready to get started on any number of meals. Here are a few ideas:
*May add to the crushed cornflakes 1-2 teaspoons of any herbs and spices; examples are thyme, parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper.

üîó Legumes and Pulses
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/legumes-pulses/

The Fabaceae or Leguminosae (commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean) family is the third largest family of flowering plants, consisting of over 20,000 species. [1]Legumes are a nutritious staple of diets around the world. They are an inexpensive source of protein, vitamins, complex carbohydrates, and fiber.
Although used interchangeably, the terms ‚Äúlegumes,‚Äù ‚Äúpulses,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeans‚Äù have distinct meanings. Alegumerefers to any plant from the Fabaceae family that would include its leaves, stems, and pods. Apulseis the edible seed from a legume plant. Pulses include beans,lentils, and peas. For example, a pea pod is a legume, but the pea inside the pod is the pulse. The entire legume plant is often used in agricultural applications (as cover crops or in livestock feed or fertilizers), while the seeds or pulses are what typically end up on our dinner plates. Beans in their various forms (kidney, black, pinto, navy,chickpeas, etc.) are just one type of pulse.
Legumes are emphasized by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines (about 3 cups a week) and the DASH Eating Plan of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (4-5 half-cup servings a week). [2]The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations declared the International Year of Pulses in 2016, focusing on the contribution of pulses in food production and nutritional diversity to help eradicate hunger and malnutrition. [3]
Legumes contain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may help prevent the development of various chronic diseases:
There are several components of legumes that may benefit heart health including fiber, folate, and phytochemicals. Legumes in their whole unprocessed form are low in saturated fat andsodium. The fibers in legumes may especially help to lower blood cholesterol even without weight changes and may prevent sharp rises in blood sugar, both of which are risk factors forcardiovascular disease. [4]
The fiber, phytochemical, and mineral content of legumes may have anti-cancer effects according to animal and cell studies. For example, nutrients in legumes such as zinc have been associated with improved immune function and decreased oxidative stress to cells, and selenium and phytic acid have been found to inhibit the growth of tumors in mice. However, there is less conclusive evidence from human studies on legumes and cancer protection.
Still, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research in their report,Food, Nutrition and Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective,included a public health goal of including pulses in most meals to help meet its recommendation of at least 30 grams of dietary fiber daily, as a high-fiber diet has been associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers like colorectal. [8] However, the WCRF specifically states that ‚Äúfoods containing dietary fibre decrease the risk of colorectal cancer‚Äù suggesting that there may be other components in high-fiber foods that could be affecting cancer development such as supporting the production of a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate (see ‚Äúdigestive health‚Äù section for further information).
Legumes contain fiber, resistant starches, and non-digestible carbohydrates like oligosaccharides.Resistant Starch, sometimes called slowly digestible starch, is not digested and enters the colon where it works similarly to fiber by promoting bulky stool and acting as aprebiotic food for beneficial bacterialike Bifidobacteria. [9] As these bacteria break down and ferment resistant starches and oligosaccharides, they create gas, which causes bloating and abdominal cramping in some people. Soaking dried beans for at least three hours and cooking them may help decrease this side effect. In the long run, however, these beneficial bacteria support normal bowel function and may reduce levels of cancer-causing compounds. [9] During fermentation, the bacteria also create a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate that may be associated with the prevention of colorectal cancer. [10]
Legumes have a low glycemic index, are high in fiber, and containslow-digesting resistant starch‚Äîall of which may benefit in the prevention ofdiabetes. Despite these beneficial components, research results have been mixed and there is not yet a definitive answer that legumes help in the prevention of type 2 diabetes or the lowering of blood glucose. The limited number of small randomized controlled trials have not produced consistent results showing a benefit. Large cohort studies have also not been conclusive:
Legumes contain dietary components that may help promoteweight loss. Their protein and soluble/insoluble fiber content may increase feelings of fullness and modestly increase calorie expenditure through thermogenesis. [2] Only about 40% of fiber in a food is broken down during digestion, which reduces total calorie intake. [13]Fiber takes longer to chew, slowing down one‚Äôs eating pace, and slows digestion in the stomach, both of which may lead to feelings of fullness.
A study using data on 8,229 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that people who ate beans had a lower body weight and smaller waist size than people who did not eat beans. [13]The bean eaters had a 23% and 22% lower risk of an increased waist size and obesity, respectively.
Food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination. However, along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. Generally, the production of plant-based foods tends to have lower greenhouse gas emissions, and use less land and water than producing animal-based foods. In transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems‚Äîespecially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050‚Äîlegumes are slated to play a key role. The 2019EAT-Lancetreport that outlines a‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äùrecommends 50 grams of legumes (about ¬º cup) in the daily diet. [14]
Legumes have a range of characteristics that make them a relatively sustainable crop. For example, legumes release up to seven times less greenhouse gas emissions per area compared to other crops, and can sequester carbon in soils. They can also make their own nitrogen from the atmosphere, thus reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers. This leaves nitrogen-rich residues in the soil after harvesting; a benefit for the next crop planted in its place. [1]According to the FAO, drought-resistant species of legumes can be of particular benefit to dry environments where food security is often a challenge. They can also help minimizefood waste, since pulses can be dried and stored for relatively long periods of time without losing their nutritional value. [15]
Despite their wide variety, legumes share many common benefits. They are relatively sustainable and inexpensive, alow glycemic indexfood, rich in protein and fiber, and satiating. Because of their ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù texture, legumes can even stand in for animal-based protein foodsin a variety of preparations. Additionally, their generally neutral flavor makes them versatile to blend well with other ingredients and pair easily with a variety of seasonings.

üîó Ask the Expert: Popular plant-based meat alternatives
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2019/08/26/questions-plant-based-meat-alternatives/

Plant-based alternatives to animal-based foods are not a new phenomenon. Tofu, for example, has often been treated as an alternative to meat for centuries. In more recent decades, food companies have processed mixtures of soy and other legumes, grains, and a variety of plants into burgers, nuggets, sausages, and other meat-shaped products. These creations were often targeted towards a vegan or vegetarian demographic, and despite their appearance, were not necessarily intended to completely recreate the taste of their meat-based counterparts.
However, a new generation of plant-based meat alternatives is aiming to do just that. In a recentJAMAViewpoint,Dr. Frank Hu, Chair of theDepartment of Nutrition, and co-authors includingGina McCarthy, Director ofC-CHANGEat the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, discuss how popular products like Impossible Foods‚Äô and Beyond Meat‚Äôs burger patties are aimed to appeal to a broader consumer base with their ‚Äúunique mimicry‚Äù of beef in both taste and experience. [1] They also note how these products are often marketed as a way to ‚Äúhelp reduce reliance on industrial meat production,‚Äù aligned with recent reports calling for dietary patterns higher in plant-based foods forboth human and planetary health. [2,3]
Can these novel products be considered part of a healthy and sustainable diet? According to the Viewpoint authors, the answer to this question ‚Äúremains far from clear given the lack of rigorously designed, independently funded studies.‚Äù We spoke with Dr. Hu to learn more about the potential benefits and concerns surrounding popular plant-based meat alternatives.
Although these alternative meats are being made from plants, you suggest caution in applying existing research findings on plant-based foods and human health. Can you talk about some of that evidence, and why it‚Äôs not readily applicable?
First of all, research has found that diets high in red meat, especially processed meat, have been associated with a range of health consequences, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. At the same time, long-term epidemiologic studies have shown that replacing red meat with nuts,legumes(e.g. lentils, peas, soy, beans), and other plant-based protein foods is associated with lower risks of these chronic diseases and total mortality. [4] Randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated that this replacement reduces levels of total and LDL cholesterol. [5]
However, rather than incorporating plant foods like legumes, these products are generally relying on purified plant protein. They are also highly processed.Food processingmay not only lead to the loss of some nutrients and phytochemicals naturally present in minimally processed plant foods; it can also create highly-palatable products. Although short-term, a recent controlled feeding study found that diets high in ultra-processed food cause excess caloric intake and weight gain. [6]¬† Therefore, we can‚Äôt directly extrapolate existing findings on plant-based foods and dietary patterns to these novel products.
Let‚Äôs focus on the two products currently dominating the landscape of alternative meats. Given that they‚Äôre often being consumed in the form of a burger, what specific questions are raised from a human health perspective?
Although Beyond Meat and Impossible burger patties contain zero cholesterol, are lower in total and saturated fat than a beef burger patty, and similar in protein and calories as a beef burger patty, they are both higher in sodium. As we note in the Viewpoint, there is no existing evidence to substantiate whether these nutrient differences alone offer any significant health benefit as a replacement.
People also aren‚Äôt typically eating burger patties on their own, so we also have to think about the broader context in which they‚Äôre consumed. For example, when placed between a bun made of refined grains, covered in sauces and other toppings, and accompanied by French fries and soda, we can‚Äôt assume that substituting one of these alternative patties for a burger patty will improve overall dietary quality.
These products achieve their imitation of meat through different processing technologies. Can you briefly explain how they differ, and if there are any unique concerns related to the methods used?
In a beef burger, the inherently ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù flavor is derived from aniron-containing molecule called heme. Impossible Foods actually takes heme from the roots of soy plants and ferments it in genetically engineered yeast. The high amounts of heme that end up in the burger give a meaty flavor and appearance. One potential concern that has been raised is that higher intake of heme iron has been associated with increased body iron stores and elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. [7]
Beyond Meat does not use heme, but rather a processing method that (according to information from the company) ‚Äúaligns plant-proteins in the same fibrous structures you‚Äôd find in animal proteins,‚Äù and then combines fats and minerals that mimics the composition and flavors of meat. Pomegranate powder and beet juice impart a ‚Äúbloody‚Äù red color.
What do you propose as a way forward in researching these novel meat alternatives?
Since these are so new and rapidly developing, it won‚Äôt be feasible to conduct large, long-term trials on disease outcomes. However, short-term, independently-funded intervention trials can be conducted to compare the effects of these products‚Äîboth with their animal-based counterparts as well as minimally-processed plant protein sources‚Äîon cardiometabolic risk factors and other factors including the microbiome. Intervention and observational studies can also examine how these plant-based meat alternatives influence overall diet quality, caloric intake, nutrient status, and body weight. Zooming-out, we‚Äôll also need to look at whether an increase in these alternatives actually leads to reduced red meat intake.
Of course, any research on this topic will not be without its challenges. With technological innovations and product reformulations, the products on the market may change quickly in both composition and availability. Red meat replacements are most popular now, but others being introduced or developed may include fish and poultry. Beyond plant-based meats, another product suite on the horizon is lab-grown meats, where animal cells are cultured to provide the product without raising and slaughtering the animal.
What are some other implications of these technologies that should be considered in researching and discussing this topic?
The goal of these technologies is to disrupt the status quo of conventional animal agriculture, which can have important public health, regulatory, and environmental implications. Regarding our planet‚Äôs health, these technologies could represent a significant opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases that fuel climate change, as well as other concerns related to existing industrial animal-based food production. For example, a Beyond Meat-commissioned Life Cycle Assessment found that the Beyond Burger generates 90% less greenhouse gas emissions, requires 46% less energy, 99% less water, and 93% less land use than a burger made from U.S. beef. [8] To be clear, such findings warrant further independently-funded studies. We should also remember to consider these products as compared with the production of minimally processed plant-based foods.
When examining these shiny new technologies, what are some key points we should not lose sight of?
As the global demand for meat is projected to increase in coming decades, these technologies may have a role to play. However, they are far from the only answer to calls for shifting to more plant-based dietary patterns. Enthusiasm around plant-based meats and other alternatives should not distract from the bigger picture that ahealthy dietary patternincludes an abundant amount of minimally processed plant foods‚Äîvegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts; moderate amounts of dairy products, seafood, and poultry; and lower amounts of processed and red meat, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, and refined grains.
Paraphrasing our Viewpoint conclusion, a fundamental change in the food system requires policies and actions that create a culture in which healthy and sustainable food choices are accessible, affordable, enjoyable, and the norm. Technology will certainly play a role, but we need to keep an eye on new innovations to ensure they are beneficial to both human and planetary health, and consider any unintended consequences.

üîó Packing a Healthy Lunchbox
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/kids-healthy-lunchbox-guide/

TheKid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Platewas created as a fun and easy guide to encourage children to eat well and keep moving. The plate‚Äôs guidelines emphasizevarietyandqualityin food choices. The formula is simple: fill half your plate (or lunch box) with colorful fruits or vegetables (aim for two to three different types), one-quarter with whole grains, and the remaining quarter with healthy proteins. Healthy fats and a small amount of dairy (if desired) round out a tasty meal that will fuel an active, healthy lifestyle.
When packing your child‚Äôs lunches, let the Kid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Plate guide and inspire you:-Remember two points‚Äîchoicesandpresentation-Save time withmeal prep-Buildsuper snacksto fill the gaps between meals-Send a refillablewaterbottle
Amidst hectic weekday schedules, meal prep is a great tool to help keep us on a healthy eating track. Although any type of meal prep requires planning, there is no one correct method. Below are just a few ideas relevant to kid‚Äôs lunches, but you canlearn more about using this helpful strategyfor other meals, too!
Snacks are meant to fill the gap between meals, not become a whole meal in itself. Keep snacks small. An easy rule of thumb for a satisfying snack is to pair a protein-rich food with a carb-rich food. Including ahealthy fatwill quiet hunger pangs even more. Depending on the child‚Äôs age and activity level, they may need one or two snacks a day.
Examples:
For more tasty snack and meal recipes, visit theFood, Fun & Family Recipe Packetcreated by theHarvard Prevention Research Center on Nutrition and Physical Activity.
Don‚Äôt forget to pack a water bottle for refilling throughout the school day.Wateris not only the best choice, but a necessary one. It restores fluids lost through everyday tasks of breathing, sweating, and even digesting meals. It keeps the body‚Äôs temperature normal on hot days and carries nutrients and oxygen to all cells. It is also free of calories, sugar, and caffeine, and other additives found insugary drinks. Beyond plain water, flavored and unsweetened seltzer or fruit-infused waters are also greathealthy beveragechoices.
Fluid needs vary based on a child‚Äôs age, size, gender, and activity level. TheNational Academy of Sciencesrecommends a range of seven to 14 cups of water per day, with the lower end for toddlers and the higher end for teenage boys. Part of this amount can come from water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables. Only when your child participates in vigorous sports lasting long periods of time (over one hour) should sports drinks be considered to supplement water. In this case you may consider making your own sports drink by mixing one quart (32 ounces) of water, 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of salt, and two ounces of 100% orange juice or plain coconut water.
Sugary drinksare a major contributor to the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes in children. In 2016 theAmerican Heart Associationrecommended that children and teens consume less than 25 grams, or six teaspoons of added sugar per day, and sugary drinks should be limited to no more than eight ounces per week.
When creating healthy and balanced meals for kids, don‚Äôt forget to do the same for the rest of the family.

üîó Processed Foods and Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/processed-foods/

Processed foods are generally thought to be inferior to unprocessed foods. The term may suggest that a packaged food item contains many ingredients, perhaps even artificial colors, flavors, or other chemical additives. Often referred to as convenience or pre-prepared foods, processed foods are suggested to contribute to the obesity epidemic and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. However, the definition of processed food varies widely depending on the source:
According to these standards, virtually all foods sold in the supermarket would be classified as ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù to some degree. Because food begins to deteriorate and loses nutrients as soon as it is harvested, even theapplesin the produce aisle undergo four or more processing steps before being sold to the consumer. That‚Äôs why in practice, it‚Äôs helpful to differentiate between the various degrees of food processing.
A popular system to classify processed foods was introduced in 2009, called the NOVA classification. It lists four categories considering the degree to which a food is processed and the purpose of these modifications: [2-4]
The NOVA system is recognized by the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization, but not currently in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration or USDA. NOVA has been criticized for being too general in classifying certain foods, causing confusion. For example, yogurt may fall into more than one category: plain yogurt is minimally processed, but fruited yogurt with added sweeteners could be labeled either processed or ultra-processed depending on how much sweetener and other chemical additives are incorporated. NOVA also does not provide comprehensive lists of specific foods in each category, so the consumer is left to guess where each may fall.
There‚Äôs no doubt that at least some processed foods are found in most people‚Äôs kitchens. There are benefits and drawbacks.
Depending on the degree of processing, nutrients can be destroyed or removed. Peeling outer layers of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may remove plant nutrients (phytochemicals) and fiber. Heating or drying foods can destroy certain vitamins and minerals. Although food manufacturers can add back some of the nutrients lost, it is impossible to recreate the food in its original form.
Currently, bread and frozen meals are some of the most consumed ultra-processed foods in the U.S. [5] While these products can be good sources of whole grains, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, they can also be high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. Given the variety of ultra-processed foods, it may be helpful to distinguish those with lower nutritional value from the broader category. Such distinction can be determined by evaluating a food‚Äôs nutritional content and long-term health effects. A product with an unevenly high ratio of calories to fiber and healthy nutrients (e.g., unsaturated fats, B vitamins, potassium) may be considered an ‚Äúultra-processed food of low nutritional value.‚Äù For example, soda provides high calories from added sugars and no healthy nutrients; and research supports an association between a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. On the other hand, whole-grain bread and fiber-containing low-sugar breakfast cereals that may be fortified with nutrients such as folic acid have consistently been linked with lower rates of stroke. [6]
To help illustrate the spectrum of food processing, the table below includes ultra-processed foods of low nutritional value as its own category. We also we separate the NOVA categories of ‚Äúunprocessed‚Äù and ‚Äúminimally processed‚Äù foods, and omit NOVA‚Äôs ‚Äúprocessed culinary ingredients‚Äù category, which mainly includes supplementary food components to assist in cooking and food preparation.
store-bought hummus made with chickpeas, spices, and oil without preservatives
Ingredients used widely in the production of ultra-processed foods such assaturated fats,added sugar, andsodiumhave become markers of poor diet quality due to their effect on heart disease, obesity, and high blood pressure. [8,9] It is estimated that ultra-processed foods contribute about 90% of the total calories obtained from added sugars. [5]
Food processing is a very broad spectrum that ranges from basic technologies like freezing or milling, to the incorporation of additives that promote shelf stability or increase palatability. As a general rule, emphasizing unprocessed or minimally processed foods in the daily diet is optimal. That said, the use of processed and even ultra-processed foods is the choice of the consumer, and there are pros and cons that come with each type. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a more processed food in one‚Äôs diet. There is evidence showing an association with certain types of food processing and poor health outcomes, especially low-nutrient ultra-processed foods that containadded sugars,excess sodium, andunhealthful fats. But there also exist ultra-processed foods that have low amounts of these ingredients while being fortified in beneficial nutrients such as calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins B and D.
Research is still clarifying if any harmful health effects from ultra-processed foods arise from the higher degree of processing or simply from the poorer nutritional quality often accompanying these types of foods. There is a growing range of processed and ultra-processed foods available, and some products may be a useful addition to a healthful diet.
You don‚Äôt have to avoid all processed foods but begin by adding more fresh or minimally processed ingredients to your shopping cart. More time may be needed to prepare these foods than just opening a can or popping a frozen container in a microwave, but the rewards may be fresher flavors, increased nutrients, and eating less additives that have no nutritional benefit.

üîó Lectins
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/anti-nutrients/lectins/

Lectins, or hemagglutinins, are an ‚Äúanti-nutrient‚Äù that have received much attention due to popular media and fad diet books citing lectins as a major cause for obesity, chronic inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. They are found in all plants, but rawlegumes(beans,lentils, peas, soybeans, peanuts) and whole grains like wheat contain the highest amounts of lectins. Is there truth behind these claims?
Lectins are defined as proteins that bind to carbohydrates. The same features that lectins use to defend plants in nature may cause problems during human digestion. They resist being broken down in the gut and are stable in acidic environments, features that protect lectin-containing plants in nature. [1]
When consumed, lectins in their active state can cause negative side effects. The most publicized accounts report severe reactions in people eating even small amounts of raw or undercooked kidney beans. They contain phytohaemagglutinin, a type of lectin that can cause red blood cells to clump together. It can also produce nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, and diarrhea. [2] Milder side effects include bloating and gas.
Animal and cell studies have found that active lectins can interfere with the absorption of minerals, especiallycalcium,iron,phosphorus, andzinc. Legumes and cereals often contain these minerals, so the concurrent presence of lectins may prevent the absorption and use of these minerals in the body. Lectins can also bind to cells lining the digestive tract. This may disrupt the breakdown and absorption of nutrients, and affect the growth and action of intestinal flora. Because lectin proteins bind to cells for long periods of time, they can potentially cause an autoimmune response and are theorized to play a role in inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. [2,3]
These theories have fueled the profitable anti-lectin movement, spawning bestselling books and enzyme supplements to prevent lectin activity in the body. However, there is very limited research in humans on the amount of active lectins consumed in the diet and their long-term health effects. Anti-nutrients including lectins are most often studied in the diets of developing countries where malnutrition is prevalent, or where food variety is very limited and whole grains and legumes are important daily staples. [4,5]
It is important to remember that eating foods with a high amount of active lectins is rare. One reason is that lectins are most potent in their raw state, and foods containing them are not typically eaten raw. Cooking, especially with wet high-heat methods like boiling or stewing, or soaking in water for several hours, can inactivate most lectins. [6] Lectins are water-soluble and typically found on the outer surface of a food, so exposure to water removes them.
An example is dried beans. To prepare them for eating, they are soaked for several hours and then boiled for several more hours to soften the bean, which disables the action of lectins. Canned beans are cooked and packaged in liquid, so they are also low in lectins. However, raw beans simmered at low heat such as in a slow-cooker or undercooking the beans will not remove all the lectins.
The body can produce enzymes during digestion that degrades some lectins. Other processes that deactivate the compounds are sprouting grains and beans, and mechanically removing the outer hull of beans and wheat grains that contain the most lectins.
There are different types of lectins in different foods, and the reactions people have to them vary widely. It is possible that one who has an underlying digestive sensitivity, such as irritable bowel syndrome, may be more likely to experience negative symptoms from eating lectins and otheranti-nutrients. Because the reported symptoms of lectin sensitivity are recognizable with physical discomfort, a reasonable solution may be to eat less of or less often the foods that cause digestive problems.
Lectins can act as anantioxidant, which protects cells from damage caused by free radicals. They also slow down digestion and the absorption ofcarbohydrates, which may prevent sharp rises in blood sugar and high insulin levels. Early research is also looking at the use of non-toxic low amounts of certain lectins to help stimulate gut cell growth in patients who are unable to eat for long periods, and in anticancer treatments due to the ability of lectins to cause cancer cell death. [2,6-7]
In many large population studies, lectin-containing foods likelegumes,whole grains, andnutsare associated with intentional weight loss and lower rates of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. [8-11] These foods are rich sources ofB vitamins,protein,fiber, and minerals, andhealthy fats. Thus, the health benefits of consuming these foods far outweigh the potential harm of lectins in these foods.

üîó Plate and the Planet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/sustainability/plate-and-planet/

Just as different foods can have differing impacts on human health, they also have differing impacts on the environment. Shifting towards a ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù can nurture both people and planet.
Human diets inextricably link health andenvironmental sustainability, and have the potential to nurture both. [1] Increased food production over the past 50 years has helped improve life expectancy and reduce hunger, infant and child mortality rates, and global poverty. However, such benefits are now being offset by shifts towards unhealthy diets.
Globally, as nations have urbanized and citizen incomes have increased, traditional diets (typically higher in quality plant-based foods), have transitioned to a ‚ÄúWestern-style dietary pattern,‚Äù characterized by high consumption of calories, highly processed foods (refined carbohydrates, added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats), and high amounts of animal products. [2,3] Along with the negative human health impacts associated with this nutrition transition, this dietary pattern is also unsustainable. Current food production is already driving climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and drastic changes in land and water use.
(Source: World Resources Institute. [4] Details about the data used to produce this figureavailable here.)
Transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems‚Äîespecially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050‚Äîposes an unprecedented challenge. However,research by an international working group of scientistsshows this ‚ÄúGreat Food Transformation‚Äù could be achievable through a combination of dramatic reductions infood losses and waste, major improvements in food production practices, and substantial dietary shifts toward mostly plant-based dietary patterns. [1]
In 2019, the EAT-LancetCommission developed the world‚Äôs first scientific targets for healthy and sustainable food systems, including a ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù with defined daily consumption ranges for each food group. This dietary pattern‚Äîcharacterized by a variety of high-quality plant-based foods and low amounts of animal-based foods, refined grains, added sugars, and unhealthy fats‚Äîis designed to be flexible to accommodate local and individual situations, traditions, and dietary preferences.

Created to meet nutritional requirements and promote health, all while staying within ‚Äúplanetary boundaries,‚Äù the Commission found that global adoption of this planetary health diet would provide major health benefits. Modeling studies show that between 10.9 to 11.6 million early deaths could be averted each year‚Äîa 19% to 23.6% reduction from current adult mortality rates. [1]
Compared with current diets, this shift will require global consumption of foods such as red meat and sugar to decrease by 50%, while consumption of fruits, nuts, vegetables, andlegumesmust double. That said, the Commission emphasizes the importance of tailoring these targets to local situations. For example, while North American countries currently consume almost 6.5 times the recommended amount of red meat, countries in South Asia eat only half the recommended amount. [1]
Undoubtedly, making such a radical shift to the global food system is unprecedented, and will depend on widespread, multi-sector, multi-level action. Alongside dramatic reductions infood wasteand major improvements in food production practices, the Commission‚Äôs report calls for ‚Äúinternational and national commitment‚Äù through a range of policy measures and actions needed to make healthy and sustainable foods more available, accessible, and affordable. Fromgovernmentsandpolicymakersto marketers, industry, the media, educational institutions,farmers,chefs,physicians, and consumers‚Äîeveryonehas an important role to play in this Great Food Transformation.
Created throughMenus of Change(a joint initiative of The Culinary Institute of America and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health‚Äôs¬† Department of Nutrition), plant-forward describes a broad set of dietary patterns and approaches to menu design that deliver both personal and planetary health but also preserve a wide range of choices.
It‚Äôs clear that what we put on our plates has a major impact on the environment. Eating more healthfully and more sustainably go hand-in-hand, meaning we can develop sustainable eating practices that improve our own health while also benefiting the health of the planet. If you‚Äôre interested in practicing a planetary health diet, but confused by the specific targets in the table above, here are some tips that may help:

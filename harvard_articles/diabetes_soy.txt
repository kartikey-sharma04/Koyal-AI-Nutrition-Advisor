üîó Chloride
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/chloride/

Chloride is a mineral naturally found in various foods, but our main dietary source is sodium chloride, otherwise known astable salt. Chloride carries an electric charge and therefore is classified as an electrolyte, along withsodiumandpotassium. It helps to regulate the amount of fluid and types of nutrients going in and out of the cells. It also maintains proper pH levels, stimulates stomach acid needed for digestion, stimulates the action of nerve and muscle cells, and facilitates the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide within cells. [1] Chloride is absorbed in the small intestine and remains in the body‚Äôs fluids and blood. Any excess amount is excreted in urine. Chloride is usually bound to sodium, and therefore the amount in blood tends to coincide with sodium levels.
AI:Adequate intakes are used when there is insufficient evidence to develop a recommended dietary allowance (RDA), and is established at an amount that ensures nutritional adequacy. The AI for chloride for people ages 14-50 and women pregnant or lactating is 2.3 grams daily, for ages 51-70 is 2 grams daily, and for ages 71+ is 1.8 grams daily. [2]
Research is not available on the association of chloride with specific diseases or health conditions. [1]
Chloride is naturally found in small amounts in meat andseafood, but the main sources in the Western diet are sodium chloride, ortable salt, and as an additive and preservative inprocessed foods.
A chloride deficiency is extremely rare in the U.S. where the average diet is high in sodium. Most foods that contain sodium will also provide chloride. [2] A loss of chloride in the body usually accompanies conditions that cause sodium losses. These include conditions that remove too much fluid from the body, such as prolonged diarrhea, vomiting, or excessive sweating. Diuretic medications that remove fluid through the kidneys can also cause decreased chloride levels. In cases of sudden, very high levels of blood glucose such as seen in people with diabetes, the kidneys will flush more sodium and water out of the body, leading to lower chloride levels. [2]
Toxicity from the diet is rare in healthy people. Excess chloride levels in the blood, called hyperchloremia, can be caused by severe dehydration, diarrhea, or metabolic problems in which the blood becomes too acidic, such as with kidney disease. A high salt diet can lead to an excessive intake of sodium chloride, which is associated with elevated blood pressure.

üîó Manganese
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/manganese/

Manganese is a trace mineral that is essential to our bodies in small amounts. Because we cannot make it, we must obtain it in food or supplements. Manganese is a coenzyme that assists many enzymes involved in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and cholesterol. [1] It also assists enzymes in building bones and keeping theimmuneand reproductive systems running smoothly. [2] Manganese works withvitamin Kto assist in wound healing by clotting the blood.
Manganese is absorbed in the small intestine. Most of the mineral is stored in bone, with smaller amounts in the liver, brain, kidneys, and pancreas. Manganese levels are difficult to measure in the body as dietary intakes do not always correlate with blood levels.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 2.3 mg a day for men and 1.8 mg for women. For women who are pregnant or lactating, the RDA is 2.0 mg and 2.6 mg, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for manganese for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 11 mg daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Manganese plays a role in the metabolism ofcarbohydratesand specifically glucose. In animal studies, a manganese deficiency can impair the action of insulin and disrupt normal blood levels of glucose. However, human studies have shown mixed results on its connection with diabetes. [2] Case-control studies have shown an association of very high and very low blood levels of manganese and an increased risk oftype 2 diabetes. [3,4] Other studies have found no association at all. [5] Therefore, it is still unclear if higher manganese intakes or manganese supplementation may protect against type 2 diabetes.
Manganese assists enzymes that build bone. Animal studies show that a deficiency of the mineral can reduce bone density and the formation of bone. Human studies have been few and small in size, and have shown conflicting conclusions. [2] Some observational studies found lower blood levels of manganese in women with osteoporosis versus those without osteoporosis; other studies found no difference. There have been no clinical trials studying the effects of manganese supplementation on bone health.
Manganese is found in a wide variety of foods, from shellfish to grains to legumes, and even spices. Drinkingwatercontains small amounts of manganese.
A deficiency of manganese is very rare, and there are no groups of people known to be at risk for developing a deficiency. Therefore, symptoms showing a deficiency have not been clearly established. The absorption of manganese may decrease if eaten with iron-rich foods, as these minerals compete for the same proteins that help with their absorption in the intestines.
There are no reports of reaching toxic levels of manganese from the diet. However, there have been isolated case reports of toxicity shown in people who drank water contaminated with unusually high levels of manganese and in industrial mining and welding workers who inhaled excess amounts of manganese in dust. [2] Becauseironand manganese rely on the same proteins that help with their absorption, having low iron stores (e.g., anemia) can increase manganese absorption and heighten a toxicity if excess manganese is present.
A manganese toxicity targets the central nervous system. Symptoms include:

üîó Oral Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/

‚ÄúThere is no health without oral health.‚Äù You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.
Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth‚Äîparticularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person‚Äôs intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body‚Äôs process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body‚Äôs immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you‚Äôre having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn‚Äôt just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

üîó Workout Supplements
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/workout-supplements/

A popular category ofdietary supplementsare workout supplements, which are typically taken before (‚Äòpre-workout‚Äô) or after exercising (‚Äòpost-workout‚Äô), and are sold in a variety of forms from pills to powders and ready-to-drink shakes. The global pre-workout supplement market size alone was estimated to reach $13.98 billion in 2020 and almost double in size to $23.77 billion by 2027. [2]
Fitness gurus and blogs touting these products as crucial for peak performance, fat loss, and explosive muscle growth in combination with complicated scientific-sounding names and labels might have you believing you can‚Äôt effectively exercise without them. But do these supplements live up to the hype, and are they even necessary‚Äîor in some cases, safe? Likeother dietary supplementsin the U.S., theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) does not reviewworkout supplements for safety or effectiveness before they are sold to consumers. It‚Äôs a good idea to research their effects and ingredients and consult with your physician before adding them to your fitness routine.
Here we review the scientific evidence behind some of the most popular ingredients in workout supplements.
Pre-workout supplements are designed to provide energy and aid endurance throughout a workout. They are typically taken 15-30 minutes before a workout, but can also be consumed during exercise. Below are common ingredients found in pre-workout supplements that the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine have highlighted as having evidence-based uses in sports nutrition. [3] These supplements have also been categorized as apparently safe and having strong evidence to support efficacy by the International Society of Sports Nutrition. [4] However, it is important to consult a physician or dietitian before using these supplements, as they are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness.
Beta-alanine is an amino acid that is produced in the liver and also found in fish, poultry, and meat. When dosed at 4‚Äì6g/day for 2‚Äì4 weeks, this supplement has been shown to improve exercise performance, particularly for high-intensity exercise lasting 1‚Äì4 minutes, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or short sprints. It has also been shown to reduce neuromuscular fatigue, particularly in older adults. [5] How does it work? During exercise the body breaks down glucose into lactic acid, which is then converted into lactate. This produces hydrogen ions, which lower muscle pH levels. This acidity reduces muscles‚Äô ability to contract, causing fatigue. [6] Beta-alanine increases muscle concentrations of carnosine, which is a proton buffer that reduces muscle acidity during high-intensity exercise, which in turn reduces overall fatigue. [5] This supplement is often combined with sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which also reduces muscle acidity. A common side effect of beta-alanine supplementation is paresthesia, or a skin tingling sensation, [3] but this effect can be attenuated by taking lower doses (1.6g) or using a sustained-release instead of a rapid-release formula. [5] In short, this supplement can help you exercise at high-intensity for a longer period of time, which could potentially lead to increased muscle mass. The International Society of Sports Nutrition has asserted that ‚Äúbeta-alanine supplementation currently appears to be safe in healthy populations at recommended doses,‚Äù but it is important to consult with your doctor before beginning supplementation.
Caffeineis a stimulant that is often included in pre-workout supplements, as it has been shown to benefit athletic performance for short-term high intensity exercise and endurance-based activities. [7] It is important to understand that these studies have been conducted with Olympic and competition athletes, and thus the average individual who exercises recreationally should consult with a doctor before using caffeine as a supplement. For high performance athletes, the International Olympic Committee recommends 3‚Äì6mg caffeine/kg of body weight consumed an hour before exercise. [7,8] Evidence also suggests that lower caffeine doses (up to 3mg/kg body weight, ~200 mg) taken before and during prolonged exercise can increase athletic performance. [9,10] Mechanistically, caffeine increases endorphin release, improves neuromuscular function, vigilance, and alertness, and reduces perception of exertion during exercise. [10,11] Despite some benefits from smaller doses, larger doses of caffeine (>=9mg/kg of body weight) have not been shown to increase performance, and may induce nausea, anxiety, and insomnia. [11] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers 400 milligrams of caffeine to be a safe amount for daily consumption,but some pre-workout supplements may exceed this amount in asingle servingor fail to disclose the amount of caffeine they contain, so it is important to always review the label of any supplement before consumption. Caffeine powder is also marketed as a stand-alone pre-workout supplement, but the FDA has advised against using this product, as even very small amounts may cause accidental overdose. Powdered caffeine has been linked to numerous deaths‚Äîa single tablespoon (10 grams) is a lethal dose for an adult, but the product is often sold in 100-gram packages. [12]
Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in skeletal muscle that is synthesized in the body from amino acids and can be obtained from red meat andseafood. In the body, it helps produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for muscles. Creatine is a popular workout supplement marketed to increase athletic performance, especially for weight training. Research suggests that creatine supplementation increases muscle availability of creatine, which in turn can enhance exercise capacity and training adaptations in adolescents, younger adults, and older adults. [13] Specifically, these adaptations allow for individuals to increase training volume (e.g., the ability to perform more repetitions with the same weight), which in turn can lead to greater increases in lean mass and muscular strength and power. [14-16] Although the exact mechanisms through which creatine improves performance have not been identified with certainty, various theories have been investigated, including the potential for creatine to stimulate muscle glycogen levels. [17,14] Creatine supplementation is primarily recommended for athletes who engage in power/strength exercises (e.g., weight lifting), or for athletes who engage in sports involving intermittent sprints and other brief repeated high-intensity exercises (e.g., soccer, basketball). [13] The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends an initial dosage of 5g of creatine monohydrate (~0.3g/kg body weight) four times daily for 5‚Äì7 days to increase muscle creatine stores; once muscle creatine stores are fully saturated, stores can be maintained by ingesting 3‚Äì5 g/day. [13] Many powdered creatine supplements recommend this regimen in the directions on their packages. The Society also notes that an alternative supplementation protocol is to ingest 3g/day of creatine monohydrate for 28 days. [13] While the scientific literature has generally found supplementation to be safe at these levels, [18] creatine may not be appropriate for people with kidney disease or those with bipolar disorder. It is important to consult a doctor before taking this supplement. Of note, creatine supplementation has been shown to increase total body water, which causes weight gain that could be detrimental to performance in which body mass is a factor, such as running. [14] The International Society of Sports Nutrition, the American Dietetic Association, and the American College of Sports Medicine have all published statements supporting creatine supplementation as an effective way of increasing high-intensity exercise capacity and lean body mass during training for high-performance athletes. [19-21;3]
A variety of post-workout supplements are marketed to consumers to increase muscle mass through enhanced muscle repair, recovery, and growth. Below is a review of some of the most common ingredients in post-workout supplements.
Replenishing glycogen stores after a workout with sufficientcarbohydrateintake is important for muscle recovery, and beginning the next workout with sufficient muscle glycogen stores has been shown to improve exercise performance. [22-24] However, normal dietary intake is typically sufficient to restore muscle glycogen stores after low-intensity exercises, such aswalking, yoga, or tai chi (3‚Äì5 g carbohydrate/kg body weight per day), and even for moderate-intensity exercise, such as one hour or more of walking, jogging, swimming, or bicycling at modest effort (5‚Äì7 g carbohydrate/kg body weight per day). [24] Post-workout supplementation with carbohydrates and protein within 24‚Äì36 hours is only recommended following strenuous physical activity, which includes one hour or more of vigorous exercise such as interval training, running, swimming, bicycling, soccer, or basketball at a moderate to intense effort (where one can only carry on brief conversations or cannot speak); in this case, 6‚Äì12 g carbohydrates/kg body weight per day is recommended to be consumed after exercise to fully restore muscle glycogen stores. [24]
Recommended levels of dailyproteinintake for the general population (0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight, or about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight) are estimated to be sufficient to meet the needs of nearly all healthy adults. [25] Recommendations for protein supplementation during exercise vary based on thetype of exercisebeing conducted: endurance training (e.g., long-distance bicycling) or resistance training (e.g., weight lifting). Very few studies have investigated the effects of prolonged protein supplementation on endurance exercise performance. A review conducted by the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that protein supplementation in the presence of adequate carbohydrate intake does not appear to improve endurance performance, but may reduce markers of muscle damage and feelings of soreness. [26] On the other hand, individuals who engage in high-intensity resistance training may benefit from increased protein consumption to optimize muscle protein synthesis required for muscle recovery and growth, but research is inconclusive, with the majority of studies investigating the effects of protein supplementation on maximal strength enhancement finding no benefit. [26] The extent to which protein supplementation may aid resistance athletes is highly contingent on a variety of factors, including intensity and duration of training, individual age, dietary energy intake, and quality of protein intake. For individuals engaging in strenuous exercise to build and maintain muscle mass, the International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends an overall daily protein intake of 1.4‚Äì2.0 g/kg of body weight/day. [26] This can be ingested in the form ofprotein foodsor protein powder.
Some sources of protein supplements:
Three out of the nine essential amino acids have a chemical structure involving a side-chain with a ‚Äúbranch‚Äù, or a central carbon atom bound to three or more carbon atoms. These three amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are called branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). They can be obtained from protein-rich foods such as chicken, red meat,fish, andeggs, and are also sold as dietary supplements in powdered form. BCAAs are key components of muscle protein synthesis, [41] and research has shown that leucine in particular drives protein synthesis and suppresses protein breakdown. [42-43] Although short-term mechanistic data suggests that leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, [44] longer-term trials do not support BCAAs as useful workout supplements. For example, a trial of leucine supplementation during an 8-week resistance training program did not result in increased muscle mass or strength among participants. [45] Studies have generally failed to find performance-enhancing effects of BCAAs such as accelerated repair of muscle damage after exercise. [46]
Another reason to be cautious of a high intake of BCAAs is its potentially negative effect on glucose metabolism and diabetes. BCAAs, particularly leucine, can disrupt the normal action of insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose. In an epidemiological study composed of three large cohorts of men and women followed for up to 32 years, a higher intake of BCAAs (obtained mainly from meats) was associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. [47]
Although you may not think of it as a ‚Äúsupplement,‚Äù a number of pro athletes have begun to promote chocolate milk as an ideal post-workout beverage due to its combination of protein, carbohydrates, water, and electrolytes (in the form of sodium and calcium). A review of the effects of chocolate milk on post-exercise recovery found that chocolate milk provided similar or superior results compared to water or other sports drinks, [48] while another review found that low-fat chocolate milk was an effective supplement to spur protein synthesis and glycogen regeneration. [49] However, the authors noted that evidence is limited and high-quality clinical trials with larger sample sizes are warranted. Of note, many studies of chocolate milk as a post-workout supplement are sponsored by the dairy industry, which may introduce bias. Chocolate milk generally contains high amounts of added sugars and saturated fat, and is likely most useful for athletes conducting high-intensity exercise for multiple hours a day, such as professional swimmers competing in the Olympics. However, for most individuals conducting moderate-intensity physical activity, such as an hour of jogging or bicycling, water is a healthier alternative as a post-workout beverage.
Many supplements include electrolytes, which are chemicals that conduct electricity when mixed with water, and include sodium, potassium, and calcium. Electrolytes are important for hydration and the regulation of nerve and muscle function; for example, calcium, sodium, and potassium all work together to help muscles contract properly. The body loses electrolytes through sweating, so sports drinks (which typically contain carbohydrates/sugar and electrolytes) and other electrolyte supplements are often marketed as being necessary after a workout. However, the American College of Sports Medicine has asserted that there is little evidence of any difference in performance between those who drink beverages containing carbohydrates and electrolytes compared to those who drink plain water after exercising for less than one hour. [50] Sports drinks and other electrolyte supplements are generally only appropriate for people exercising vigorously for more than an hour, especially if causes them to sweat heavily.Learn more about sports drinks here.
Workout supplements such as caffeine and creatine may be used to enhance exercise performance for high-intensity, strenuous physical activity, such as training to run a marathon or power lifting. However, ahealthy dietwith adequate amounts of healthycarbohydrates,protein, andwateris sufficient to fuel the body for moderate amounts ofphysical activity, such as an hour of jogging or bicycling. As workout supplements are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness, you should consult with a doctor before incorporating them into your exercise routine and discuss if there are any potential contraindications if you have existing medical conditions.

üîó Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 released
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2021/01/12/2020-dietary-guidelines/

The 9th edition of theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025is out, with the tagline toMake Every Bite Count. Intended for policy makers, healthcare providers, nutrition educators, and Federal nutrition program operators, the new edition has expanded to almost 150 pages, providing nutrition guidelines for even more age groups throughout the life cycle. As in theprevious edition, the Dietary Guidelines emphasize dietary patterns rather than promoting specific nutrients or foods. This allows for greater flexibility in food choices, as health benefits are achieved by consuming a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods across different food categories, rather than a few ‚Äúsuperfoods.‚Äù In addition, the Dietary Guidelines again emphasize how nutrition educators need to be aware that food choices are strongly impacted by age, race, cultural traditions, environment,food access,budget, and personal beliefs and preferences. [1]
The key players in the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern‚Äù remain unchanged from the previous edition of the Guidelines:
Dietary components to limit:
The guidelines carry over the same limits for saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, but this time include a specific age range:
While the Guidelines include dietary patterns that remain examples of healthy diets (‚ÄúHealthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealthy Vegetarian Pattern‚Äù), the dietary targets for the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Pattern‚Äù emphasize a diet relatively high in meat, eggs, and dairy foods. Dr.Walter Willett, Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said this about the new Guidelines:
In general, there was minimal change from the last edition of the Guidelines, which did include many positive suggestions. However, guidance that considers scientific evidence on specific protein sources and health, and also the environmental consequences of dietary patterns, is needed to provide Americans with advice and policies for healthy and sustainable diets. The current Dietary Guidelines fail to do this.
Like theprevious edition, the Guidelines are¬†silent on the environmental impacts of their dietary targets, which other analyses show would have serious impacts on climate change and other environmental footprints because of the relatively large amounts of meat and dairy foods recommended. [2] Along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. The production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods‚Äîand red meat (especially beef) and dairy stand out for their disproportionate impact.
Willett points out that the Guidelines‚Äô continued dairy recommendation of 3 servings¬†per day has never been justifiedby evidence for health outcomes, and the guidance for low-fat and fat-free dairy products doesn‚Äôt detail a plan for disposal of the fat naturally present in milk:
Because the disposal of dairy fat would be hugely wasteful, it would almost certainly remain in the food supply, which makes this recommendation somewhat of a fantasy. The report does appropriately mention thatsoymilk is an alternative to cow milk, but to avoid the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy food consumption at three servings per day, the majority of milk and dairy foods would need to beplant-based.
Similarly, the Guidelines also recommend lean meats, but don‚Äôt discuss the fate of cuts of meat that are not lean. Willett says that realistically,¬†they would almost certainly be consumed, ‚Äúprobably as cheap cuts and processed meats, especially by low-income groups who already experience excess rates of obesity and diabetes.‚Äù
It‚Äôs notable that the overall protein recommendation leads with ‚Äúlean meats,‚Äù which could be interpreted by consumers as including ‚Äúlean‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù cuts of bacon or other processed meats. Although further guidance clarifies that ‚Äúmost intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey) versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham, luncheon meats),‚Äù [1] this statement is buried within the chapters of the guidelines, rather than emphasized within the summarized protein recommendation. This is a particularly important distinction, since consuming healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat canlower the risk of several diseases and premature death.

üîó Dairy
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/dairy/

Dairy foods include a range of food and beverage products that make up classic combinations: cereal with milk, cheese and crackers, yogurt and berries, ice cream sundaes. While ice cream and cream cheese are examples of indulgent dairy foods that are viewed as every-so-often treats, a lack of clarity exists over other dairy foods that offer protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other healthful nutrients. Ischeesea healthy food? Is non/low-fatmilkandyogurtbetter for the heart than full-fat versions? Traditionally, whole milk dairy products have been viewed as the less healthful choice because of their predominant type of fat‚Äîsaturated fat.
Saturated fats were targeted in the 1970s and 1980s as potentially causing harm to health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980 recommended choosing non/low-fat dairy foods in place of full-fat versions (except for young children). In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools in the U.S. to replace whole milk with non/low-fat unflavored milk or non-fat flavored milk. Sales of low-fat and fat-free milks, yogurts, and cheeses skyrocketed despite complaints about their lack of flavor and satisfaction. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend three 1-cup (8 ounce) servings of non/low-fat milk or similar amounts of low-fat cheese, yogurt, or other dairy foods for adults and children over 9 years old to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of bone fractures. [1]
To the surprise of many, research in the 2000s defied these longstanding guidelines to suggest that full-fat dairy foods might be just as healthful as their lower-fat counterparts, provoking scientists to look more closely at all dairy products. Upon closer examination, they realized that dairy foods are not one and the same. The fermentation process required to make cheese and yogurt may impart unique health benefits as well as improved digestibility from a lower lactose content. That said,howpeople eat dairy is important to consider. Take cheese for example: is it consumed melted on fast-food burgers, pasta, and pizza that are already high in refined carbohydrate, sodium, and saturated fat? Or is it served in thin wedges, eaten with fresh fruit as a snack or dessert? Another key point is frequency and amount. If people drink several glasses of low-fat milk or snack on reduced-fat cheese throughout the day, they might end up eating as much saturated fat (or more) than if they had consumed one glass of whole milk or serving of full-fat cheese.
These questions are important to consider when reviewing scientific research on dairy foods.
Dairy foods like milk, ice cream, cream, and soft cheeses like cottage and ricotta are high in lactose. Yogurt and aged cheeses are low in lactose because their production involves fermentation by natural bacteria that break down and consume the lactose. This is why some people with lactose intolerance may be able to safely consume some types of cheese and yogurt without side effects. Lactaid pills are a commercial product that contains the lactase enzyme that breaks down lactose, and can be taken before meals containing dairy to help reduce uncomfortable side effects. Lactaid milk is cow‚Äôs milk that contains the lactase enzyme so the product is very low in lactose.
The nutrients and types of fat in dairy are involved with bone health, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. Calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus are important for bone building, and the high potassium content of dairy foods can help lower blood pressure.
Studies on dairy have limitations that may be a cause of seemingly conflicting findings. In observational studies, people who consume a high amount of milk may be different from those who do not in ways that are not fully captured by statistical adjustments. Randomized clinical trials tend to be short in duration with a small number of participants, making it difficult to see possible effects of dairy intake on chronic diseases like heart disease and bone fractures that take years to develop. Thus, longer-term epidemiological studies may provide additional insights.
The recommendations for dairy foods from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 are based on short-term clinical trials that have shown that higher intakes of calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density. However, after one year the differences in bone density are not significant compared with a placebo. [2] Meta-analyses of prospective studies have not found an association of total dairy food intake and hip fracture risk. [3,4]
The effects of dairy foods are of special interest with children due to calcium and vitamin D playing an important role in bone growth. These nutrients are essential, but the critical question is the amount needed to minimize bone fracture risk.
Sometimes research looks at calcium intakes compared with calcium balance (how much calcium is eaten from foods and supplements compared with how much calcium is lost by the body). Calcium balance is positive during growing phases, such as in childhood and adolescence. Calcium balance is negative in the elderly, when the risk of bone loss increases. Studies have found that amount of calcium needed to achieve positive calcium balance varies among groups of people. Although the U.S. recommendation of about 3 cups daily of milk or dairy foods daily provides about 900-1000 mg calcium, some studies have shown that children and adults can achieve positive calcium balance with as little as 400 mg daily. [7,8]
More than half of the type of fat in dairy is saturated, which is a known risk factor forheart diseaseand the reason why the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends only non/low-fat dairy products. However, removing one type of food from the diet usually means replacing it with another. Swapping saturated fat with low-fat foods but also possibly more refined carbohydrates may help to lower LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol but can raise triglycerides, a different risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High blood levels of triglycerides can lead to hardening of the arteries.
The evidence on dairy foods and their relation totype 2 diabetesmellitus (T2DM) is inconclusive. While population studies on total dairy intake tend to show little or no association with T2DM, closer evaluations of specific foods like yogurt suggest a possible protective effect. The protein and probiotics in yogurt may help to lower blood glucose and affect gut microbiota that prevents weight gain. [13]
The types of saturated fats in dairy have also gained greater attention, as some types of saturated fatty acids in dairy are different than those in red meat, and may have a more neutral effect on blood cholesterol.¬† A study of 3,333 adults from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and Health Professional‚Äôs Follow-up Study assessed the participants‚Äô blood levels of various dairy fatty acids. [16] It found that higher blood levels of these saturated fatty acids were associated with less incidents of T2DM. However, it is possible the metabolic abnormalities that precede the diagnosis of T2DM by many years may have affected the blood levels of these fatty acids.
It has been speculated that although full-fat dairy contains more calories and fat than reduced-fat dairy, full-fat versions may taste better and be more filling. This in turn might prevent extra snacking between meals or even eating less over the course of a day. However, randomized clinical trials have not shown an overall effect of dairy foods on weight loss or body weight changes. [17] In a large prospective study of three cohorts of men and women, intakes of low-fat and whole milk and cheese had no association with weight changes, though yogurt in the diet was associated with less weight gain over time.[18]
The fat in dairy foods contains estrogenic hormones that are associated with a higher risk of some hormone-related cancers. High amounts of dairy foods in the diet have been associated with certain cancers, including endometrial and prostate, but with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for breast cancer have not been consistent [8].
The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day). 250 grams is about one (8-ounce) cup ofmilk,yogurt, or equivalent amounts ofcheese(because milk is about 90% water, this amounts to about 1 oz of hard cheese). If everyone were¬† to consume 2 servings of dairy per day, climate change would be difficult to control. [26]
Both full-fat and non/low-fat dairy foods can be good sources of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin D. Dairy foods that undergo fermentation, such asyogurtandsome cheeses, are lower in lactose and contain healthful gut bacteria that may benefit digestive health. However, the nutrients inmilkcan be found in other foods and therefore it is not an essential food even for the normal growth and development in children and for the prevention of health conditions like bone fractures.
Although full-fat dairy foods are high in saturated fat, whether full-fat dairy is more harmful (or more beneficial) to health than non/low-fat dairy will depend on the sources calories that replace the dairy fat. If this is sugar there may be little difference, but if this is unsaturated fat (such as in nuts or plant oils), the lower fat version would be better. The total amount of dairy consumption is also important; at only one serving per day, the amount of fat would not be important, whereas it would with 3 or more servings per day. Thus, while more research emerges, the type of dairy one incorporates into their dietary pattern can be a matter of personal preference. Some people enjoy using non-fat milk in their cereal or eating a low-fat Greek yogurt. Others may find that choosing a richer full-fat yogurt as an afternoon snack works well to prevent extra snacking before dinner. The overall dietary pattern is key, andcreating a balanced plateallows for 0 to 2 servings daily of dairy (of any type) can be healthy.

üîó Milk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/milk/

Milk is the liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals, including humans. Breast milk is the preferred food for infants, as it is well-tolerated while their digestive tracts develop and mature.Dairymilk may be introduced at later ages if tolerated well. Although dairy milk may come from any mammal, cows, goats, buffalo, and sheep are common producers.This section will focus on dairy milk from cows, and briefly discuss non-dairy plant milk alternatives.
Whole cow‚Äôs milk contains about 87% water. The remaining 13% contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Processing techniques remove fat to produce lower fat varieties: ‚Äúreduced fat‚Äù contains 2% milkfat, ‚Äúlowfat‚Äù contains 1% milkfat, and ‚Äúnonfat‚Äù or ‚Äúskim‚Äù has virtually no milkfat. Cows are often pregnant while they are milked, so dairy milk contains hormones like insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), estrogens, and progestins. Some cows are given additional hormones to increase milk production.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends including three 8-ounce servings of milk daily (or equal portions of other dairy foods like cheese or yogurt), which is justified to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Marketing efforts such as the iconic ‚ÄúGot Milk?‚Äù campaign with celebrities donning milk mustaches spread this message as well. However, research has not shown a consistent benefit on bone health with high intakes of milk, and furthermore has suggested potential harm with certain conditions like prostate cancer. [1]
Research on milk often produces contrary findings. Some reasons may be the wide range of different nutritional qualities in milk and how milk intake is measured, as seen in the following factors:
The connection of milk andcardiovascular disease(CVD) is unclear. Whole milk contains saturated fat, which is known to increase total cholesterol, raising both LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù and HDL ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol levels. However, the minerals in milk, specifically calcium and potassium may help to control blood pressure.
Comparison of milk with other foods in the diet can affect study results. For example, if comparing milk with high saturated fat meats, milk may show no difference in heart health. However, if dairy fat in milk is compared with unsaturated plant oils, nuts, or seeds, milk may appear to increase CVD risk.
Milk contains nutrients important for bone health: calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein. However, an association with milk intake and decreased hip fractures has not been made.
Interestingly, the countries with the highest intakes of milk and calcium have the highest hip fracture rates. [8] Yet it‚Äôs unclear that milk alone is responsible because these studies are epidemiological and find associations rather than direct causes. It is known that higher milk intake tends to increase height, and a taller height is strongly related to fractures of the hip and other bones, particularly in men. [9]
Two meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies did not find an association between milk intake and risk of hip fractures. [10, 11] This result was found even with high milk intakes of 3-4 glasses a day.
Although it is believed that high calcium intakes at preadolescent and adolescent years may protect against bone loss later in life, studies have not supported this. The Recommended Daily Allowance for calcium in the U.S. for preadolescents ages 9-13 years is 1300 mg daily, but the calcium recommendations in other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom are only on average 750 mg daily. Drinking three servings of milk daily for 18 months in adolescent boy and girls with a low calcium intake did not effect bone mass. [12] For further nutritional guidance for children and adolescents, visit Harvard‚ÄôsKid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Plate.
Contrary to widespread belief, research does not support that milk helps with weight control. Although a meta-analysis of 29 randomized controlled trials found that milk and other dairy foods were beneficial for body fat reduction in the short-term and if calories were restricted, no benefits on body weight were seen in the long-term and when calories were not restricted. [13] A later meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials found similar beneficial effects of dairy intake on body weight and body fat when calories were limited, but without a calorie restriction, weight gain was likely. [14]
A large study of more than 12,000 adolescents looked to see if total milk helped to prevent weight gain. It found that dairy fat was not associated with weight gain, but a high intake of low-fat milk (more than 3 servings daily) was associated with weight gain and higher body mass index, mainly from the extra calories obtained. [15]
The association of milk anddiabetesis unclear. Dairy foods are associated with a moderately lower risk of type 2 diabetes in cohort studies, but the benefit mainly appears with eating fermented milk products like yogurt rather than from milk. [16, 17] Although the action of yogurt in benefiting diabetes is unclear, it contains helpful bacteria that may reduce inflammation or improve the action of the body‚Äôs natural insulin.
Higher milk intake is associated with increased incidence of prostate cancer. The Physicians‚Äô Health Study of 21,660 men found that an intake of more than 2.5 servings of dairy foods daily (compared with a half or less serving daily) was associated with a 12% increased risk prostate cancer. In men who consumed 1 or more servings of milk daily (compared with rarely consumed), skim milk was associated with an increased risk of early stage prostate cancer, and whole milk was associated with fatal advanced prostate cancer. [18]
A meta-analysis of 111 cohort studies by the World Cancer Research Fund found a decreased risk of colorectal cancer with higher milk intake but mostly in men. This is possibly due to the high calcium content in milk, a mineral found to be protective of colorectal cancer. [19]
Bottom line:The health benefits of dairy foods appear to be stronger for fermented types likeyogurt, which play a role in thegut microbiome. Milk possesses several individual nutrients that can affect blood pressure and bone health, but some of their health-promoting effects may be weakened by whole milk‚Äôs high saturated fat content. Although popular media articles have speculated that whole milk is not less healthful than skim milk, research has not supported this statement in regards to diabetes and heart disease, and a high intake of any type of milk can lead to weight gain due to the extra calories.
The name A2 milk may sound like a futuristic space food, but it is a type of milk now sold in some stores. A1 and A2 are two types of gene variants of casein, a protein in cow‚Äôs milk. The digestion and breakdown of casein produces a peptide (BCM-7) that has been associated with inflammation, digestive discomfort, and even some chronic diseases. [20] Some animal studies have shown that A1 milk has 4 times the amount of BCM-7 than A2 milk. Certain cattle breeds possess more of the A1 gene variant than A2, and visa versa. [20]
Through epidemiological studies and animal studies, a high intake of A1 casein has been associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease, increased incidence of type 1 diabetes, and some neurological disorders such as autism. [21]
However, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a summary report after conducting a review of the literature. Some of their findings:
A2 milk distributers market their product as beneficial for adults, children, and infants who experience milk intolerances, whether from milk allergy or lactose intolerance. Symptoms of these conditions include gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea. However, it is noted that the majority of clinical trials comparing A1 with A2 milk, with findings showing improved tolerance and less gastrointestinal side effects with A2 milk, are funded by the A2 Corporation, producer of the brand ‚Äúa2 Milk‚Äù that is sold worldwide.
Bottom line:although milk with the A2 gene variant may be metabolized differently in the body than A1 milk, there is not enough evidence from research to show that these differences significantly affect health. If one has lactose intolerance or a milk allergy causing unpleasant symptoms, A2 milk may be tried. Plant-based milks are another option as they do not contain lactose or the milk protein casein.
Although fans of raw milk believe it tastes better and offers more nutrients than processed milk, raw milk is not pasteurized and may harbor harmful bacteria includingSalmonella, ListeriaandE. coli. Currently, twenty states prohibit the sale of raw milk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness than illnesses related to pasteurized dairy products. Between 1993 and 2006 more than 1,500 people in the U.S. became ill from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. [22] Raw milk and soft cheeses made from raw milk like Brie, Camembert, Queso Blanco, and Queso Fresco are especially dangerous for older adults, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and children. In pregnant women,Listeriacan cause miscarriage, or illness or death of a fetus or newborn.
The production ofdairy foodsplaces considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day), which is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk.
Milk is often sold in cartons or opaque containers because too much exposure to light can cause a loss of vitamin A and B2. Choose a carton with the latest sell-by or use-by date (indicating it is the freshest). Most milk sold in supermarkets is pasteurized and homogenized, processing techniques that use heat to kill most of the bacteria present and break down fat molecules so that texture of milk remains smooth and creamy.
*Some sugars are created in the processing of oats to make oat milk, which are listed as ‚Äúadded sugars‚Äù even if no other sweeteners are added.
Milk requires refrigeration at a temperature below 40 F. If it has been stored at room temperature for two hours or longer, it is recommended to discard it. Although pasteurization kills much of the bacteria in milk, any remaining bacteria can grow quickly in milk at room temperature or warmer. Once milk is opened, it will last about 3-5 days after the sell-by date on the label. Spoiled milk has a strong, sour odor and lumpy texture caused by excess bacteria producing lactic acid, which curdles the protein in milk and produces off odors.
Store milk towards the rear of the refrigerator rather than the front or side shelf door, where the temperature varies the most. Don‚Äôt forget to close the carton or recap the bottle to prevent the milk from absorbing the odors and flavors of other foods in the refrigerator.
Lactose-free milk undergoes pasteurization and the addition of an enzyme lactase, which breaks down the milk sugar lactose, so it generally lasts longer than regular milk. If refrigerated properly, lactose-free milk can last about 7 days after the sell-by date once it is opened.
Milk is not just for drinking by the glass or splashing onto cold cereal. Adding milk to foods can boost one‚Äôs intake of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and other nutrients.
Several other animals produce milk including sheep, goat, and yaks. These types of milk are more popular in European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries than in the U.S. Sheep‚Äôs milk can be made into various cheeses like feta and ricotta, and goat‚Äôs milk produces a popular cheese called goat cheese or chevre.
How do they compare nutritionally? Sheep, goat, and yak milks contain about the same if not more calcium than cow‚Äôs milk. The amount of protein and carbohydrate are about the same. They all contain some lactose but less than found in cow‚Äôs milk, so they may be easier to digest for people with lactose sensitivity.

üîó Ask the Expert: The role of diet and nutritional supplements during COVID-19
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2020/04/01/ask-the-expert-the-role-of-diet-and-nutritional-supplements-during-covid-19/

Social distancing and regular handwashing are the most effective and proven methods to reduce risk and spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, along with general questions on how to safely shop for and prepare food (addressed here), many are wondering about the more specific role of diet and nutrition during this pandemic. To understand more about the link between nutrition and immunity, and existing evidence on nutrient status, supplementation, and infection, we spoke withDr. Wafaie Fawzi,Dr. Walter Willett, and PhD student, Dr. Ibraheem Abioye. As more information becomes available on this topic, we will check back with our experts to provide additional updates. Last update: 4.9.20[En espa√±ol]
We have known for a long time thatnutrition is intricately linked to immunityand to the risk and severity of infections. Poorly nourished individuals are at a greater risk of various bacterial, viral, and other infections. Conversely, chronic or severe infections lead to nutritional disorders or worsen the nutritional status of affected people. Therefore, it is imperative for all of us to pay attention to our diet and nutritional status during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the clinical course of COVID-19 disease tends to be more severe among older individuals and among people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer that are partly related to nutrition. [1] Although data are not yet available, co-infections, such as HIV/AIDS, may also be associated with more severe outcomes, and optimal nutrition plays an important role in maintaining health among people with such infections.
Indeed, consuming good quality diets is always desirable, and this is particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. A healthy diet, as depicted by theHealthy Eating Plate, emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, moderate consumption of fish, dairy foods, and poultry, and limited intake of red and processed meat, refined carbohydrates, and sugar. Added fats should be primarily liquid oils such as olive, canola, or soybean oil.¬† Such a diet will provide appropriate amounts of healthy macronutrients and essential minerals and vitamins. Eating high-quality sources ofprotein,fat, andcarbohydratecan help maintain a healthy weight and good metabolic state; this is not a time for highly restrictive, crash diets. If someone does develop a COVID-19 infection, eating enough of these healthy calories to prevent unintended weight loss is important. Adequate amounts ofminerals and vitaminsprovided by a healthy diet helps to ensure sufficient numbers of immune cells and antibodies, which are important as the body mounts a response to infections.
There have been many studies evaluating intakes of specific nutrients in relation to other infections. To give a few examples:
Many acute respiratory tract infections tend to be more severe in people living with HIV/AIDS and other immune deficiencies, [17] and surveillance efforts for COVID-19 targeting these populations are important. Nutrition also has an important role in this category of people. First, HIV infection and malnutrition tend to co-exist. As the disease becomes severe, many people living with HIV tend to be undernourished. Some HIV drugs also lead to metabolic disease. Second, among patients with HIV infection, poor nutritional status and micronutrient deficiencies worsen HIV disease and increase the risk of treatment failure and death. Before the advent of antiretroviral therapy, studies demonstrated that people living with HIV with higher quality diets and better nutritional status tended to live longer and had fewer complications. They were less likely to be anemic and had higher CD4 cell ¬†counts (counts of white blood cells that fight infection). Randomized controlled trials and large cohort studies in Africa and Asia have also shown that the use of multivitamins leads to fewer deaths and slows down disease progression considerably. [18-20] The findings from these studies were consistent whether the HIV-infected patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy or not. In the US, optimal intake of vitamins and minerals was similarly associated with reduced HIV disease progression and mortality. [21] Therefore, good quality diet and multivitamin supplementation are likely to be helpful in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among people with HIV and similar diseases.
Dietary surveys in the US and elsewhere show that most people are consuming diets that do not meet national guidelines‚Äîoften because of availability or cost‚Äîand such diets may not provide optimal quantities of essential vitamins and minerals. Currently, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to put many more individuals at risk of food insecurity and make consuming a healthy diet even more difficult. This becomes increasingly likely if the infection risk-mitigation strategies do not include approaches to ensure essential supplies are effectively distributed and accessible, or if the pandemic affects productivity of the agricultural sector.
Although we are not aware of good data on the effects of nutritional supplements on risk or severity of COVID-19, existing evidence indicates that supplements of several nutrients can reduce risk or severity of some viral infections, particularly among people with inadequate dietary sources. Therefore, prudence suggests that inadequate intakes of essential minerals and vitamins be avoided at this time, and supplements can help fill some gaps. Some key points:

üîó Mushrooms
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/mushrooms/

An often under-appreciated food, mushrooms have been eaten and used as medicine for thousands of years. Traditional and folk medicine practitioners laud the bell-shaped fungi for their healing and cleansing properties. All varieties of mushrooms are low in calories and fat, and contain modest amounts of fiber and various nutrients. Perhaps the more interesting properties of mushrooms are their non-nutritive plant substances‚Äîpolysaccharides, indoles, polyphenols, and carotenoids in which cell and animal studies have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. [1] Mushrooms are also recognized by chefs for their ability to create savory rich flavors called umami, thanks to the presence of an amino acid called glutamate, which is also found in meats, fish, cheeses, and simmering soups.
Although considered a vegetable, mushrooms are neither a plant nor animal food. They are a type of fungus that contains a substance called ergosterol, similar in structure to cholesterol in animals. Ergosterol can be transformed into vitamin D with exposure to ultraviolet light. Mushrooms vary in appearance with more than 10,000 known types, but generally they are distinguished by a stem, fleshy rounded cap, and gills underneath the cap. China and the U.S. are among the top five producers of mushrooms worldwide.
The amount of vitamin D mushrooms contain varies widely and depends on how long the mushrooms are exposed to UV light. Estimates show that fresh wild mushrooms like chanterelles and morels can contain up to 1200 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving, whereas mushrooms grown in darkened conditions like white button, shiitake, and oyster contain less than 40 IU. [3] However, button mushrooms that are exposed to sunlight can produce up to 400 IU vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving though the exact amount depends on factors related to their UV exposure such as the time of day, season, latitude, and duration. Mushrooms treated with UV lamps can produce even higher amounts of vitamin D. Even after harvesting, mushrooms can continue to produce vitamin D, whether exposed to UV light from the sun or a lamp.
Dried mushrooms also contain the vitamin. Some estimates show dried mushrooms to contain about 600 IU of vitamin D2 per 3.5 ounces if stored in dark, cool, dry conditions for up to 6 months (the vitamin may start to break down after that time). [3]
Humidity and cooking mushrooms in water do not appear to affect vitamin D content in mushrooms, but cooking them in fat (such as oils) can cause the vitamin to leach out because it is fat-soluble.
Edible mushrooms like maitake and shiitake have also been used as medicine throughout history. Other mushrooms that are too tough to eat have been used solely for medicinal purposes such as reishi. Plant chemicals and components in mushrooms may exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects, but the exact mechanism is still unclear and an area of active research. [4] Animal and cell studies show that mushrooms can stimulate the activity of immune cells, macrophages, and free radicals that can stop the growth and spread of tumor cells and cause existing tumor cells to die. [5] Various polysaccharides in mushrooms including beta-glucans are believed to exert these cancer-fighting properties. [4,6]
Two epidemiological studies found that higher mushroom intake had protective effects on the brain in older adults. [7, 8] Components in mushrooms may prevent the growth of amyloid proteins related to dementia, and act as antioxidants, specifically an amino acid called ergothioneine. A 2019 cross-sectional study of 663 Chinese men and women 60 years of age and older found that those who ate more than 2 servings of mushrooms per week (1 serving = 3/4 cup cooked) compared with those who ate less than 1 serving per week had a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). [9] After adjusting for potential confounders (factors linked with cognitive decline) such as body mass index, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and dietary intake of meat, vegetables, fruits, and nuts, the group with the higher intake of mushrooms had a 52% lower risk of developing MCI than the low intake group. This cross-sectional study only provided a snapshot of the prevalence of MCI in the participants at one point in time; the authors noted that a direct effect of mushrooms on cognition could not be made by this study. For example, it is possible that people who developed MCI had changed their diet that included less mushrooms. Epidemiological studies following people over time, measuring biomarkers for ergothioneine and other mushrooms substances, and randomized clinical trials that administer ergothioneine or other mushroom phytonutrients will help to shed light on its potential effect on cognition.
Mushrooms contain polysaccharides that act as aprebiotic, or food for beneficial gut bacteria. Studies show that these polysaccharides stimulate the growth and survival of beneficial strains like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. They remain undigested and therefore can reach the colon where these bacteria live. [10, 11]
In two large prospective cohort studies, mushroom consumption was not significantly associated with risk oftype 2 diabetes,cardiovascular disease, [12] or cancer. [13]¬† However, low levels of mushroom consumption in the populations may have limited the ability of these studies to detect significant associations. In addition, mushroom consumption was measured once at baseline and consumption patterns may have changed over time. Moreover, different types of mushrooms were not assessed in the Food Frequency Questionnaires.
There are thousands of varieties of mushrooms, with different colors, shapes, and sizes. Because some wild mushrooms can cause stomach upset or allergic reactions, or may even be poisonous, your safest bet is to stick to supermarket varieties and avoid picking and eating raw wild mushrooms on your own.
The common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) is the most common in the U.S. It is the mildest-tasting mushroom and can be eaten raw or cooked.
Other types of mushrooms available for sale include:
Chanterelle:the cap is a wavy golden trumpet-like shapeCremini (baby bella):a young Portobello mushroom that is dark and firmEnoki:long, thin white stems with small white caps that are eaten raw or cookedMaitake:a head that resembles flowering leavesMorel:the cap is a spongy dimpled oblong shapeOyster:a fan-shaped delicate capPorcini:a reddish-brown rounded cap with a thick cylindrical stemPortobello:a large brown thick cap with rich juicy flavor that work well as a meat substituteShiitake:a dark brown umbrella cap with a thin cream-colored stem
Mushrooms that have been specially treated with UV light may carry a label on the front of the package that says ‚ÄúUV-treated‚Äù or ‚Äúrich in vitamin D,‚Äù or display the exact amount of vitamin D they contain.
Select mushrooms with firm whole caps with an even texture. They should be refrigerated until use, but ideally within one week. Do not wash or clean them until just before using. Storing in a brown paper bag with the top open will help to absorb moisture and keep them from spoiling, as opposed to tight plastic wrapping that traps moisture. Because they are about 80-90% water, mushrooms do not freeze well, becoming mushy when defrosted.
Mushrooms are delicate and should be cleaned gently. Either place them under gentle running water to release any dirt or brush dirt off with a dampened paper towel.
Cooking mushrooms in high-temperature water such as boiling and microwaving may cause its water-soluble nutrients (B vitamins, potassium) to escape in the cooking water. Saut√©ing quickly over high heat, or simmering over low heat, such as in soups, are ideal cooking methods for preserving nutrients.
More recipe ideas and serving suggestions featuring mushrooms:
Not all mushrooms are edible. Wild mushrooms with white gills or a ring around the stem are considered poisonous. Some other inedible mushrooms look like edible mushrooms, so unless one is trained in recognizing wild mushrooms, it‚Äôs best to find your mushrooms at the market!

üîó Legumes and Pulses
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/legumes-pulses/

The Fabaceae or Leguminosae (commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean) family is the third largest family of flowering plants, consisting of over 20,000 species. [1]Legumes are a nutritious staple of diets around the world. They are an inexpensive source of protein, vitamins, complex carbohydrates, and fiber.
Although used interchangeably, the terms ‚Äúlegumes,‚Äù ‚Äúpulses,‚Äù and ‚Äúbeans‚Äù have distinct meanings. Alegumerefers to any plant from the Fabaceae family that would include its leaves, stems, and pods. Apulseis the edible seed from a legume plant. Pulses include beans,lentils, and peas. For example, a pea pod is a legume, but the pea inside the pod is the pulse. The entire legume plant is often used in agricultural applications (as cover crops or in livestock feed or fertilizers), while the seeds or pulses are what typically end up on our dinner plates. Beans in their various forms (kidney, black, pinto, navy,chickpeas, etc.) are just one type of pulse.
Legumes are emphasized by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines (about 3 cups a week) and the DASH Eating Plan of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (4-5 half-cup servings a week). [2]The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations declared the International Year of Pulses in 2016, focusing on the contribution of pulses in food production and nutritional diversity to help eradicate hunger and malnutrition. [3]
Legumes contain several components that, when eaten as part of a balanced plant-rich diet, may help prevent the development of various chronic diseases:
There are several components of legumes that may benefit heart health including fiber, folate, and phytochemicals. Legumes in their whole unprocessed form are low in saturated fat andsodium. The fibers in legumes may especially help to lower blood cholesterol even without weight changes and may prevent sharp rises in blood sugar, both of which are risk factors forcardiovascular disease. [4]
The fiber, phytochemical, and mineral content of legumes may have anti-cancer effects according to animal and cell studies. For example, nutrients in legumes such as zinc have been associated with improved immune function and decreased oxidative stress to cells, and selenium and phytic acid have been found to inhibit the growth of tumors in mice. However, there is less conclusive evidence from human studies on legumes and cancer protection.
Still, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research in their report,Food, Nutrition and Prevention of Cancer: A Global Perspective,included a public health goal of including pulses in most meals to help meet its recommendation of at least 30 grams of dietary fiber daily, as a high-fiber diet has been associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers like colorectal. [8] However, the WCRF specifically states that ‚Äúfoods containing dietary fibre decrease the risk of colorectal cancer‚Äù suggesting that there may be other components in high-fiber foods that could be affecting cancer development such as supporting the production of a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate (see ‚Äúdigestive health‚Äù section for further information).
Legumes contain fiber, resistant starches, and non-digestible carbohydrates like oligosaccharides.Resistant Starch, sometimes called slowly digestible starch, is not digested and enters the colon where it works similarly to fiber by promoting bulky stool and acting as aprebiotic food for beneficial bacterialike Bifidobacteria. [9] As these bacteria break down and ferment resistant starches and oligosaccharides, they create gas, which causes bloating and abdominal cramping in some people. Soaking dried beans for at least three hours and cooking them may help decrease this side effect. In the long run, however, these beneficial bacteria support normal bowel function and may reduce levels of cancer-causing compounds. [9] During fermentation, the bacteria also create a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate that may be associated with the prevention of colorectal cancer. [10]
Legumes have a low glycemic index, are high in fiber, and containslow-digesting resistant starch‚Äîall of which may benefit in the prevention ofdiabetes. Despite these beneficial components, research results have been mixed and there is not yet a definitive answer that legumes help in the prevention of type 2 diabetes or the lowering of blood glucose. The limited number of small randomized controlled trials have not produced consistent results showing a benefit. Large cohort studies have also not been conclusive:
Legumes contain dietary components that may help promoteweight loss. Their protein and soluble/insoluble fiber content may increase feelings of fullness and modestly increase calorie expenditure through thermogenesis. [2] Only about 40% of fiber in a food is broken down during digestion, which reduces total calorie intake. [13]Fiber takes longer to chew, slowing down one‚Äôs eating pace, and slows digestion in the stomach, both of which may lead to feelings of fullness.
A study using data on 8,229 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that people who ate beans had a lower body weight and smaller waist size than people who did not eat beans. [13]The bean eaters had a 23% and 22% lower risk of an increased waist size and obesity, respectively.
Food production places an enormous demand upon our natural resources, as agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, deforestation, species extinction, and freshwater depletion and contamination. However, along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. Generally, the production of plant-based foods tends to have lower greenhouse gas emissions, and use less land and water than producing animal-based foods. In transitioning towards healthy diets from sustainable food systems‚Äîespecially with our global population slated to reach 10 billion by 2050‚Äîlegumes are slated to play a key role. The 2019EAT-Lancetreport that outlines a‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äùrecommends 50 grams of legumes (about ¬º cup) in the daily diet. [14]
Legumes have a range of characteristics that make them a relatively sustainable crop. For example, legumes release up to seven times less greenhouse gas emissions per area compared to other crops, and can sequester carbon in soils. They can also make their own nitrogen from the atmosphere, thus reducing the application of nitrogen fertilizers. This leaves nitrogen-rich residues in the soil after harvesting; a benefit for the next crop planted in its place. [1]According to the FAO, drought-resistant species of legumes can be of particular benefit to dry environments where food security is often a challenge. They can also help minimizefood waste, since pulses can be dried and stored for relatively long periods of time without losing their nutritional value. [15]
Despite their wide variety, legumes share many common benefits. They are relatively sustainable and inexpensive, alow glycemic indexfood, rich in protein and fiber, and satiating. Because of their ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù texture, legumes can even stand in for animal-based protein foodsin a variety of preparations. Additionally, their generally neutral flavor makes them versatile to blend well with other ingredients and pair easily with a variety of seasonings.

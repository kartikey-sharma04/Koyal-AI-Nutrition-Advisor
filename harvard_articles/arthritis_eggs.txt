üîó Diet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that ‚Äúinflammation‚Äù is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by ourimmune system. When a foreign invader enters the body such as bacteria, viruses, or allergens, or an injury occurs, our immune cells act quickly. We may sneeze or cough to rid the body of an offending agent. We may feel pain and swelling at the site of a cut or injury to signal us to be gentle with this delicate area. Blood flows in rapidly, which may produce warmth or redness. These are signs that our immune system is repairing damaged tissue or fighting invaders. As healing takes place, inflammation gradually subsides.
Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state. Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body‚Äôs immune system to constantly attack cells. This sometimes occurs with autoimmune disorders like lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn‚Äôs disease. Sometimes an unhealthy lifestyle from lack of exercise, high stress, and calorie-rich diets can trigger chronic low levels of inflammation throughout the entire body, termed metaflammation. [1,2] This type of low-grade inflammation does not usually produce noticeable symptoms, but over time metaflammation can pave the pathway for chronic conditions likecardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and certaincancers(e.g., breast, colon).
Anti-inflammatory diets may be promoted for these inflammatory conditions. They include several foods that are believed to interfere with the inflammatory process, though research on its exact mechanism is not conclusive. There is no single anti-inflammatory diet plan. Generally it emphasizes eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, minimally refined whole grains, tea, coffee, herbs, spices, and oily fish. TheMediterranean dietandDASH dietare popular dietary plans that already showcase many anti-inflammatory foods.
An anti-inflammatory diet plan not only highlights specific foods and food groups but limits other foods that may contribute to metaflammation such as fatty cuts ofred meat,refined sugary foodsandbeverages, and excessalcohol.
An anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes. It suggests a variety of anti-inflammatory foods to eat daily, rather than focusing on eating one or two specific foods or nutrients. This ensures a greater variety of protective food components, some of which may work synergistically toboost immunity. These foods provide plant chemicals (phytochemicals), antioxidants, and fiber that prevent cellular stresses, inhibit inflammatory signals caused by the immune system, promote healthygut microbiota, and slow down digestion to prevent surges in blood glucose. [3] They may also favorably affect the composition of fat cells to further reduce inflammation.
Other factors aside from diet may help to control inflammation, such asexercising regularly,controlling stress, andgetting enough sleep.
Most available research focuses on foods and dietary patterns that are associated with metaflammation, which in turn helps to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Metaflammation is especially associated with Western-type dietary patterns high in processed meats, saturated fat, refined sugars, salt, and white flour while being low in fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals. [1,4] These diets also tend to be calorie-dense with a high glycemic load, potentially leading toblood sugar surges, insulin resistance, and excess weight gain. Studies have shown that Western diets are associated with increased blood markers of inflammation, though the connection may be due to a string of events rather than one direct action. [1] For example, exposure to air pollution and chronic mental stress can lead to an excess of free radicals produced in the body, which then oxidize and damage other molecules. Atherosclerosis is one condition in which these free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol particles. The actions of both oxidized LDL cholesterol and several types of immune cells form lesions and plaque in the heart arteries that can lead to ischemicheart disease(a type of heart disease caused by narrowed or partially blocked arteries). [5] A long-term diet that is high in saturated fat andcholesterolmay raise LDL levels, increasing the risk of free radical action that may promote this immune response, which partially contributes to a chronic low-level proinflammatory state.
A major cause of low-level inflammation is the build-up of fatty acids in fat tissue (and other tissues) promoted by a high-fat or high-sugar diet. This may cause fat tissue to send signals to immune cells that produce inflammation in various areas, including organs like the pancreas. An inflamed pancreas can then lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, the combination of carrying extra body fat (obesity) and eating a diet high in saturated fat and refined sugars increases the risk of cell damage because of increased immune cell activity.
An anti-inflammatory diet contains foods rich in nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals and limits foods found in a typical Western diet to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. There is also emerging research studying the effects of high-fiber plant-rich diets that support a greater diversity ofbeneficial gut microbes, which may prevent a condition called metabolic endotoxemia. This is a low-grade inflammation that occurs because of an increase in the number of endotoxins, which are believed to cause the inflammation associated with metabolic diseases likecardiovascular diseaseandtype 2 diabetes. [6,7]
The most common causes of leaky gut are drug abuse and food toxins (for example, gluten acting as a toxin in susceptible people with celiac disease). Certain nutrients, such as the amino acids glutamine and tryptophan, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease intestinal permeability by improving the tight junctions. [28]Fiberin the diet can improve the diversity of bacteria in the gut that increases production of short chain fatty acids and other beneficial metabolites, which in turn strengthens the intestinal barrier. Foods rich inprebiotics and probiotics, and probiotic supplements, are also being studied. Much more research is needed to confirm the relationship of dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions, and potential treatments.
An anti-inflammatory diet is a healthful eating plan that may help to reduce chronic low levels of inflammation that otherwise might increase the risk of various chronic diseases. Although research is limited, it may also help to lower inflammatory markers in individuals with autoimmune-type inflammation such as with rheumatoid arthritis. Popular dietary patterns that are anti-inflammatory include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and vegetarian diets. People may seek the guidance of a registered dietitian familiar with any of these dietary patterns to assist with meal planning and appropriate portion sizes. Along with the diet, it is important to incorporate other healthy lifestyle factors that positively affect the body‚Äôs immune response, such as practicingstress reduction,exercising regularly, and getting adequatesleep.

üîó Collagen
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/collagen/

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. Its fiber-like structure is used to make connective tissue. Like the name implies, this type of tissue connects other tissues and is a major component of bone, skin, muscles, tendons, and cartilage. It helps to make tissues strong and resilient, able to withstand stretching.
In food, collagen is naturally found only in animal flesh like meat and fish that contain connective tissue. However, a variety of both animal and plant foods contain materials for collagen production in our own bodies.
Our bodies gradually make less collagen as we age, but collagen production drops most quickly due to excess sun exposure, smoking, excess alcohol, and lack ofsleepandexercise. With aging, collagen in the deep skin layers changes from a tightly organized network of fibers to an unorganized maze. [1] Environmental exposures can damage collagen fibers reducing their thickness and strength, leading to wrinkles on the skin‚Äôs surface.
Despite its abundance in our bodies, collagen has become a top-selling supplement purported to improve hair, skin, and nails‚Äîkey components of the fountain of youth. The idea of popping a pill that doesn‚Äôt have side effects and may reverse the signs of aging is attractive to many. According to Google Trends, online searches for collagen have steadily increased since 2014.
Collagen first appeared as an ingredient in skin creams and serums. However, its effectiveness as a topical application was doubted even by dermatologists, as collagen is not naturally found on the skin‚Äôs surface but in the deeper layers. Collagen fibers are too large to permeate the skin‚Äôs outer layers, and research has not supported that shorter chains of collagen, called peptides, are more successful at this feat.
Oral collagen supplements in the form of pills, powders, and certain foods are believed to be more effectively absorbed by the body and have skyrocketed in popularity among consumers. They may be sold as collagen peptides or hydrolyzed collagen, which are broken down forms of collagen that are more easily absorbed. Collagen supplements contain amino acids, the building blocks ofprotein, and some may also contain additional nutrients related to healthy skin and hair likevitamin C,biotin, orzinc.
Most research on collagen supplements is related to joint and skin health. Human studies are lacking but some randomized controlled trials have found that collagen supplements improve skin elasticity. [3,4] Other trials have found that the supplements can improve joint mobility and decrease joint pain such as with osteoarthritis or in athletes. [5] Collagen comprises about 60% of cartilage, a very firm tissue that surrounds bones and cushions them from the shock of high-impact movements; so a breakdown in collagen could lead to a loss of cartilage and joint problems.
However, potential conflicts of interest exist in this area because most if not all of the research on collagen supplements are funded or partially funded by related industries that could benefit from a positive study result, or one or more of the study authors have ties to those industries. This makes it difficult to determine how effective collagen supplements truly are and if they are worth their often hefty price.
A downside of collagen supplements is the unknown of what exactly it contains or if the supplement will do what the label promotes. There are also concerns of collagen supplements containing heavy metals. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administrationdoes not review supplements for safety or effectivenessbefore they are sold to consumers.
Another potential downside is that taking a collagen supplement can become an excuse to not practice healthy behaviors that can protect against collagen decline, such as getting enough sleep and stopping smoking.
That said, the available research has not shown negative side effects in people given collagen supplements. [3,4]
There is a lack of research to show that eating collagen can directly benefit skin or joint health. When digested in the stomach, collagen is broken down into amino acids, which are then distributed wherever the body most needs protein. Still, many foods that support collagen production are generally recommended as part of a healthful eating plan.
In reality, bone broth contains only small amounts of minerals naturally found in bone includingcalcium,magnesium,potassium,iron,phosphorus,sodium, and copper. The amount ofprotein, obtained from the gelatin, varies from 5-10 grams per cup.
There is some concern that bone broth contains toxic metals like lead. One small study found that bone broth made from chicken bones contained three times the lead as chicken broth made with the meat only. [7] However the amount of lead in the bone broth per serving was still less than half the amount permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency in drinking water. A different study found that bone broth, both homemade and commercially produced, contained low levels (<5% RDA) of calcium and magnesium as well as heavy metals like lead and cadmium. [9] The study noted that various factors can affect the amount of protein and minerals extracted in bone broth: the amount of acidity, cooking time, cooking temperature, and type of animal bone used. Therefore it is likely that the nutritional value of bone broths will vary widely.
Along with ahealthy and balanced diet, here are some habits that may help protect your body‚Äôs natural collagen:
At this time, non-industry funded research on collagen supplements is lacking. Natural collagen production is supported through a healthy and balanced diet byeating enough protein foods,whole grains,fruits, and vegetablesand reducing lifestyle risk factors.

üîó Pantothenic Acid ‚Äì Vitamin B5
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/pantothenic-acid-vitamin-b5/

Vitamin B5, or pantothenic acid, is naturally present in foods, added to foods, and available as a supplement. It is used to make coenzyme A (CoA), a chemical compound that helps enzymes to build and break down fatty acids as well as perform other metabolic functions, and acyl carrier protein, which is also involved in building fats. [1] Pantothenic acid is found in a wide variety of foods. Bacteria in the gut can also produce some pantothenic acid but not enough to meet dietary needs.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for men and women ages 19+ years is 5 mg daily. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 6 mg and 7 mg daily, respectively.
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. A UL has not been established for pantothenic acid, because a toxic level has not been observed from high intakes. [2]
Because pantothenic acid helps to break down fats, it has been studied for a potential role in reducing cholesterol levels in people who have dyslipidemia. This is a condition in which there is an abnormally high concentration of fat or lipids in the blood (e.g., LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol, triglycerides), and low levels of HDL ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol. Low levels of CoA may prevent the breakdown and clearance of fats in the blood. [3] It has also been proposed that pantothenic acid may have an antioxidant effect that reduces low-grade inflammation, which is present in the early stages ofheart disease. [4] However, research in this area is still limited, and it is unclear if pantothenic acid supplements can lower blood fats independently of (or enhance the cholesterol-lowering effects of) eating a heart-healthy diet.
Pantothenic acid is found in almost all plant and animal foods to some degree, because the vitamin is found in all living cells. The best sources are beef, chicken, organ meats, fortified cereals, and some vegetables. [2]
Because pantothenic acid is found in a wide variety of foods, a deficiency is rare except in people who have other nutrient deficiencies, as seen with severe malnutrition. Other rare cases are seen in persons with genetic mutations in which pantothenic acid cannot be metabolized.
Symptoms of deficiency may include:
A toxic level of pantothenic acid has not been observed from food sources. With very large daily doses of 10 grams a day, stomach upset or mild diarrhea has been reported. [2] However, this is rare and a Tolerable Upper Intake Level for pantothenic acid has not been established.
Pantothenic acid is sold as a supplement purported to help dozens of conditions, from allergies and dandruff to leg cramps and arthritis. Unfortunately there is little evidence to support these claims.

üîó Selenium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/selenium/

Selenium is a trace mineral, which means that the body only needs a small amount of it. It is found naturally in foods or as a supplement. Selenium is an essential component of various enzymes and proteins, called selenoproteins, that help to make DNA and protect against cell damage and infections; these proteins are also involved in reproduction and the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Most selenium in the body is stored in muscle tissue, although the thyroid gland holds the highest concentration of selenium due to various selenoproteins that assist with thyroid function.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years of age is 55 micrograms daily. Women who are pregnant and lactating need about 60 and 70 micrograms daily, respectively.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for selenium for all adults 19+ years of age and pregnant and lactating women is 400 micrograms daily; a UL is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health.
Selenium is a component of selenoproteins and enzymes. These have antioxidant properties that help to break down peroxides, which can damage tissues and DNA, leading to inflammation and other health problems.
A Cochrane review of 13 prospective observational studies showed a 31% reduced risk of cancer and 45% reduced risk of deaths from cancer in the groups with the highest selenium intakes or blood levels compared with the lowest selenium levels, particularly in men. [1] Yet, the authors cautioned about weaknesses in the meta-analysis since there were differences among the study populations and possible inaccuracy when assessing dietary selenium (regional differences in the selenium content of food was not accounted for).
Another Cochrane review of 83 randomized placebo-controlled trials did not find that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer type. In addition, some of the trials noted a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes with long-term use of selenium supplements (about 7 years) who had normal selenium blood levels at the start the of study. Further research is needed to replicate this finding. [2]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and cancer before making specific dietary recommendations.
There are high concentrations of selenium in the thyroid gland, where there are several selenium-containing enzymes regulating thyroid function. If the body does not have enough selenium, it can lead to autoimmune thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto‚Äôs disease and Graves‚Äô disease. Both of these conditions cause the body to create antibodies that attack the thyroid gland, leading to an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).
Randomized controlled trials studying selenium supplementation show mixed results. Supplements have not been shown to significantly affect thyroid function in people with normal thyroid or mild hypothyroidism, despite causing increased blood levels of selenium. [3,4] Other studies have shown selenium to decrease the amount of these antibodies and promote the activity of selenoproteins, which work to decrease inflammation. [5]
The role of selenium supplementations for people with autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATD) is still unclear. ¬†A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine controlled trials did not find that selenium supplements changed thyroid hormone function in people with ATD, nor did a Cochrane review. [6]
Selenoproteins help to protect cell membranes from damage by free radicals and keep blood platelets from becoming sticky, both of which can lead to heart disease. However, both cohort studies and clinical trials have shown mixed results regarding the relationship of selenium andcardiovascular disease (CVD).
Observational studies have shown that people with both low and high selenium exposure (based on dietary intake and blood levels) have an increased risk of CVD. Others have found no association at all. [7] Clinical trials have not found that selenium supplements reduce the risk of CVD or cardiac death; however these trials were small and included people who were not likely selenium deficient at the start of the study. [7]
Additional research is needed on the association of selenium and CVD before making specific dietary recommendations.
The amount of selenium in foods can vary widely depending on the selenium content of the soil in which it is grown. Soil content varies widely by region. Plant foods obtain selenium from soil, which will then affect the amount of selenium in animals eating those plants.Protein foodsfrom animals are generally good sources of selenium. Seafood, organ meats, and Brazil nuts are the foods highest in selenium although Americans obtain most of their selenium from everyday staples, like breads, cereals, poultry, red meat, andeggs.
A deficiency of selenium in the U.S. is rare as the soil throughout North America is generally rich in selenium. [7] Even if people live in areas with lower-selenium soil, the transport of food across the region as well as the use of fortified foods and supplements reduce the risk of deficiency.
Two conditions are associated with severe selenium deficiency: 1) Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy, or disease of heart muscle, and 2) Kashin-Beck disease, a form of osteoarthritis.
Symptoms:
Groups at risk for deficiency:
Chronically high intakes of selenium can lead to health problems, ranging from muscle tremors, hair loss, stomach upset, and lightheadedness, to more severe outcomes of heart attack, respiratory distress, or kidney failure. Brazil nuts are exceptionally high in selenium even when grown in low-selenium soil, with even one nut containing more than the RDA. Eating too many of these nuts on a daily basis can reach a toxic level, as well as using supplements that contain selenium in excess of the RDA.

üîó Vitamin D
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-d/

Vitamin D is both a nutrient we eat and a hormone our bodies make. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that has long been known to help the body absorb and retaincalciumandphosphorus; both are critical for building bone. Also, laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections and reduce inflammation. Many of the body‚Äôs organs and tissues have receptors for vitamin D, which suggest important roles beyond bone health, and scientists are actively investigating other possible functions.
Few foods naturally contain vitamin D, though some foods are fortified with the vitamin. For most people, the best way to get enough vitamin D is taking a supplement because it is hard to eat enough through food. Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 (‚Äúergocalciferol‚Äù or pre-vitamin D) and vitamin D3 (‚Äúcholecalciferol‚Äù). Both are also naturally occurring forms that are ¬†produced in the presence of the sun‚Äôs ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays, hence its nickname, ‚Äúthe sunshine vitamin,‚Äù but D2 is produced in plants and fungi and D3 in animals, including humans. Vitamin D production in the skin is the primary natural source of vitamin D, but many people have insufficient levels because they live in places where sunlight is limited in winter, or because they have limited sun exposure due to being inside much of the time. Also, people with darker skin tend to have lower blood levels of vitamin D because the pigment (melanin) acts like a shade, reducing production of vitamin D (and also reducing damaging effects of sunlight on skin, including skin cancer).
The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D provides the daily amount needed to maintain healthy bones and normalcalcium metabolismin healthy people. It assumes minimal sun exposure.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for adults 19 years and older is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily for men and women, and for adults >70 years it is 800 IU (20 mcg) daily.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for vitamin D for adults and children ages 9+ is 4,000 IU (100 mcg).
Many people may not be meeting the minimum requirement for the vitamin. NHANES data found that the median intake of vitamin D from food and supplements in women ages 51 to 71 years was 308 IU daily, but only 140 IU from food alone (including fortified products). [1] Worldwide, an estimated 1 billion people have inadequate levels of vitamin D in their blood, and deficiencies can be found in all ethnicities and age groups. [2-4] In the U.S., about 20% of White adults and 75% of Black adults have blood levels of vitamin D below 50 nmol/L. [83] In industrialized countries, doctors are seeing the resurgence of rickets, the bone-weakening disease that had been largely eradicated through vitamin D fortification. [5-7] There is scientific debate about how much vitamin D people need each day and what the optimal serum levels should be to prevent disease. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released in November 2010 recommendations increasing the daily vitamin D intake for children and adults in the U.S. and Canada, to 600 IU per day. [1] The report also increased the upper limit from 2,000 to 4,000 IU per day. Although some groups such as The Endocrine Society recommend 1,500 to 2,000 IU daily to reach adequate serum levels of vitamin D, the IOM felt there was not enough evidence to establish a cause and effect link with vitamin D and health benefits other than for bone health. ¬†Since that time, new evidence has supported other benefits of consuming an adequate amount of vitamin D, although there is still not consensus on the amount considered to be adequate.
The role of vitamin D in disease prevention is a popular area of research, but clear answers about the benefit of taking amounts beyond the RDA are not conclusive. Although observational studies see a strong connection with lower rates of certain diseases in populations that live in sunnier climates or have higher serum levels of vitamin D, clinical trials that give people vitamin D supplements to affect a particular disease are still inconclusive. This may be due to different study designs, differences in the absorption rates of vitamin D in different populations, and different dosages given to participants. Learn more about the research on vitamin D and specific health conditions and diseases:
Several studies link low vitamin D blood levels with an increased risk of fractures in older adults. Some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation in certain amounts may prevent such fractures, while others do not. [8-11]
Vitamin D may help increase muscle strength by preserving muscle fibers, which in turn helps to prevent falls, a common problem that leads to substantial disability and death in older people. [14‚Äì16] A combined analysis of multiple studies found that taking 700 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day lowered the risk of falls by 19%, but taking 200 to 600 IU per day did not offer any such protection. [17] However, the VITAL trial following healthy middle-aged men and women did not find that taking 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily compared with a placebo pill reduced the risk of falls. [82]
Though taking up to 800 IU of vitamin D daily may benefit bone health in some older adults, it is important to be cautious of very high dosage supplements. A clinical trial that gave women 70+ years of age a once-yearly dosage of vitamin D at 500,000 IU for five years caused a 15% increased risk of falls and a 26% higher fracture risk than women who received a placebo. [18] It was speculated that super-saturating the body with a very high dose given infrequently may have actually promoted lower blood levels of the active form of vitamin D that might not have occurred with smaller, more frequent doses. [13]
JoAnn Manson, MD, DrPH, leader of the main VITAL trial and coauthor of the report on fracture, commented:
‚ÄúWe conclude that, in the generally healthy U.S. population of midlife and older adults, vitamin D supplementation doesn‚Äôt reduce the risk of fractures or falls. This suggests that only small-to-moderate amounts of vitamin D are needed for bone health and fall prevention, achieved by most community-dwelling adults. Of course, vitamin D deficiency should always be treated and some high-risk patients with malabsorption syndromes, osteoporosis, or taking medications that interfere with vitamin D metabolism will benefit from supplementation.‚Äù
Nearly 30 years ago, researchers noticed an intriguing relationship between colon cancer deaths and geographic location: People who lived at higher latitudes, such as in the northern U.S., had higher rates of death from colon cancer than people who lived closer to the equator. [19] Many scientific hypotheses about vitamin D and disease stem from studies that have compared solar radiation and disease rates in different countries. These studies can be a good starting point for other research but don‚Äôt provide the most definitive information. The sun‚Äôs UVB rays are weaker at higher latitudes, and in turn, people‚Äôs vitamin D blood levels in these locales tend to be lower. This led to the hypothesis that low vitamin D levels might somehow increase colon cancer risk. [3]
Animal and laboratory studies have found that vitamin D can inhibit the development of tumors and slow the growth of existing tumors including those from the breast, ovary, colon, prostate, and brain. In humans, epidemiological studies show that higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with substantially lower rates of colon, pancreatic, prostate, andother cancers, with the evidence strongest for colorectal cancer. [20-32]
However, clinical trials have not found a consistent association:
The Women‚Äôs Health Initiative trial, which followed roughly 36,000 women for an average of seven years, failed to find any reduction in colon or breast cancer risk in women who received daily supplements of 400 IU of vitamin D and 1,000 mg of calcium, compared with those who received a placebo. [33,34] Limitations of the study were suggested: 1) the relatively low dose of vitamin D given, 2) some people in the placebo group decided on their own to take extra calcium and vitamin D supplements, minimizing the differences between the placebo group and the supplement group, and 3) about one-third of the women assigned to vitamin D did not take their supplements. 4) seven years may be too short to expect a reduction in cancer risk. [35,36]
A large clinical trial called the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) followed 25,871 men and women 50+ years of age free of any cancers at the start of the study who took either a 2,000 IU vitamin D supplement or placebo daily for a median of five years. [37] The findings did not show significantly different rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer between the vitamin D and placebo groups. The authors noted that a longer follow-up period would be necessary to better assess potential effects of supplementation, as many cancers take at least 5-10 years to develop.
Although vitamin D does not seem to be a major factor in reducing cancer incidence, evidence including that from randomized trials suggests that having higher vitamin D status may improve survival if one develops cancer.¬† In the VITAL trial, a lower death rate from cancer was observed in those assigned to take vitamin D, and this benefit seemed to increase over time since starting on vitamin D. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of vitamin D, which included the VITAL study, found a 13% statistically significant lower risk of cancer mortality in those assigned to vitamin D compared to placebo. [38] These findings are consistent with observational data, which suggest that vitamin D may have a stronger effect on cancer progression than for incidence.
The heart is basically a large muscle, and like skeletal muscle, it has receptors for vitamin D. [39] Immune and inflammatory cells that play a role incardiovascular diseaseconditions like atherosclerosis are regulated by vitamin D. [40] The vitamin also helps to keep arteries flexible and relaxed, which in turn helps to control high blood pressure. [41]
In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study nearly 50,000 healthy men were followed for 10 years. [42] Those who had the lowest levels of vitamin D were twice as likely to have a heart attack as men who had the highest levels. Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have found that people with the lowest serum levels of vitamin D had a significantly increased risk of strokes and any heart disease event compared with those with the highest levels. [40;43-46]
However, taking vitamin D supplements has not been found to reduce cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of 51 clinical trials did not demonstrate that vitamin D supplementation lowered the risk of heart attack, stroke, or deaths from cardiovascular disease. [47] The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) came to the same conclusion; it followed 25,871 men and women free of cardiovascular disease who took either a 2,000 IU vitamin D supplement or placebo daily for a median of five years. No association was found between taking the supplements and a lower risk of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) compared with the placebo. [37]
Vitamin D deficiency may negatively affect the biochemical pathways that lead to the development ofType 2 diabetes(T2DM), including impairment of beta cell function in the pancreas, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Prospective observational studies have shown that higher vitamin D blood levels are associated with lower rates of T2DM. [48]
More than 83,000 women without diabetes at baseline were followed in the Nurses‚Äô Health Study for the development of T2DM. Vitamin D and calcium intakes from diet and supplements were assessed throughout the 20-year study. [49] The authors found that when comparing the women with the highest intakes of vitamin D from supplements with women with the lowest intakes, there was a 13% lower risk of developing T2DM. The effect was even stronger when vitamin D was combined with calcium: there was a 33% lower risk of T2DM in women when comparing the highest intakes of calcium and vitamin D from supplements (>1,200 mg, >800 IU daily) with the lowest intakes (<600 mg, 400 IU).
A randomized clinical trial gave 2,423 adults who hadprediabeteseither 4000 IU of vitamin D or a placebo daily for two years. The majority of participants did not have vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study. At two years, vitamin D blood levels in the supplement versus placebo group was 54.3 ng/mL versus 28.2 ng/mL, respectively, but no significant differences were observed in rates of T2DM at the 2.5 year follow-up. [50] The authors noted that a lack of effect of vitamin D may have been due to the majority of participants having vitamin D blood levels in a normal range of greater than 20 ng/mL, which is considered an acceptable level to reduce health risks. ¬†Notably, among the participants who had the lowest blood levels of vitamin D at the beginning of the study, vitamin D supplementation did reduce risk of diabetes. This is consistent with the important concept that taking additional vitamin D may not benefit those who already have adequate blood levels, but those with initially low blood levels may benefit.
Vitamin D‚Äôs role in regulating the immune system has led scientists to explore two parallel research paths: Does vitamin D deficiency contribute to the development of multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and other so-called ‚Äúautoimmune‚Äù diseases, where the body‚Äôs immune system attacks its own organs and tissues? And could vitamin D supplements help boost our body‚Äôs defenses to fight infectious disease, such as tuberculosis and seasonal flu?
Multiple SclerosisThe rate of multiple sclerosis (MS) is increasing in both developed and developing countries, with an unclear cause. However, a person‚Äôs genetic background plus environmental factors including inadequate vitamin D and UVB exposure have been identified to increase risk. [51] Vitamin D was first proposed over 40 years ago as having a role in MS given observations at the time including that rates of MS were much higher far north (or far south) of the equator than in sunnier climates, and that geographic regions with diets high in fish had lower rates of MS. [52] A prospective study of dietary intake of vitamin D found women with daily intake above 400 IU had a 40% lower risk of MS. [53] In a study among healthy young adults in the US, White men and women with the highest vitamin D serum levels had a 62% lower risk of developing MS than those with the lowest vitamin D levels. [54] The study didn‚Äôt find this effect among Black men and women, possibly because there were fewer Black study participants and most of them had low vitamin D levels, making it harder to find any link between vitamin D and MS if one exists. Another prospective study in young adults from Sweden also found a 61% lower risk of MS with higher serum vitamin D levels; [55] and a prospective study among young Finnish women found that low serum vitamin D levels were associated with a 43% increased risk of MS. [56] In prospective studies of persons with MS, higher vitamin D levels have been associated with reduced disease activity and progression. [57,58] While several clinical trials are underway to examine vitamin D as a treatment in persons with MS, there are no clinical trials aimed at prevention of MS, likely because MS is a rare disease and the trial would need to be large and of long duration. Collectively, the current evidence suggests that low vitamin D may have a causal role in MS and if so, approximately 40% of cases may be prevented by correcting vitamin D insufficiency. [59] This conclusion has been strengthened substantially by recent evidence that genetically determined low levels of vitamin D predict higher risk of multiple sclerosis.
Type 1 DiabetesType 1 diabetes(T1D) is another disease that varies with geography‚Äîa child in Finland is about 400 times more likely to develop T1D than a child in Venezuela. [60] While this may largely be due to genetic differences, some studies suggest that T1D rates are lower in sunnier areas. Early evidence suggesting that vitamin D may play a role in T1D comes from a 30-year study that followed more than 10,000 Finnish children from birth: Children who regularly received vitamin D supplements during infancy had a nearly 90% lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes than those who did not receive supplements. [61] However, multiple studies examining the association between dietary vitamin D or trials supplementing children at high risk for T1D with vitamin D have produced mixed and inconclusive results [62] Approximately 40% of T1D cases begin in adulthood. A prospective study among healthy young adults in the US found that White individuals with the highest levels of serum vitamin D had a 44% lower risk of developing T1D in adulthood than those with the lowest levels. [63] No randomized controlled trials on vitamin D and adult onset T1D have been conducted, and it is not clear that they would be possible to conduct. More research is needed in this area.
Flu and the Common ColdThe flu virus wreaks the most havoc in the winter, abating in the summer months. This seasonality led a British doctor to hypothesize that a sunlight-related ‚Äúseasonal stimulus‚Äù triggered influenza outbreaks. [64]¬†More than 20 years after this initial hypothesis, several scientists published a paper suggesting that vitamin D may be the seasonal stimulus. [65]¬†Among the evidence they cite:
A randomized controlled trial in Japanese school children tested whether taking daily vitamin D supplements would prevent seasonal flu. [67]¬†The trial followed nearly 340 children for four months during the height of the winter flu season. Half of the study participants received pills that contained 1,200 IU of vitamin D; the other half received placebo pills. Researchers found that type A influenza rates in the vitamin D group were about 40% lower than in the placebo group; there was no significant difference in type B influenza rates.
Although randomized controlled trials exploring the potential of vitamin D to prevent other acute respiratory infections have yielded mixed results, a large meta-analysis of individual participant data indicated that daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation lowers risk of acute respiratory infections.¬†[68]¬†This effect was particularly prominent for very deficient individuals.
The findings from this large meta-analysis have raised the possibility that low vitamin D levels may also increase risk of or severity ofnovel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)infection.¬†Although there is no direct evidence on this issue because this such a new disease, avoiding low levels of vitamin D makes sense for this and other reasons.¬†Thus, if there is reason to believe that levels might be low, such as having darker skin or limited sun exposure, taking a supplement of 1000 or 2000 IU per day is reasonable.¬†This amount is now part of many standard multiple vitamin supplements and inexpensive.
More research is needed before we can definitively say that vitamin D protects against the flu and other acute respiratory infections. Even if vitamin D has some benefit, don‚Äôt skip your flu shot. And when it comes to limiting risk of COVID-19, it is important to practice careful social distancing and hand washing.
TuberculosisBefore the advent of antibiotics, sunlight and sun lamps were part of the standard treatment for tuberculosis (TB). [69] More recent research suggests that the ‚Äúsunshine vitamin‚Äù may be linked to TB risk. Several case-control studies, when analyzed together, suggest that people diagnosed with tuberculosis have lower vitamin D levels than healthy people of similar age and other characteristics. [70] Such studies do not follow individuals over time, so they cannot tell us whether vitamin D deficiency led to the increased TB risk or whether taking vitamin D supplements would prevent TB. There are also genetic differences in the receptor that binds vitamin D, and these differences may influence TB risk. [71] Again, more research is needed.
Other Autoimmune ConditionsThe Vitamin D and Omega 3 trial (VITAL), a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial following more than 25,000 men and women ages 50 and older, found that taking vitamin D supplements (2,000 IU/day) for five years, or vitamin D supplements with marine omega-3 fatty acids (1,000 mg/day), reduced the incidence of autoimmune diseases by about 22%, compared with a placebo. Autoimmune conditions observed included rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and autoimmune thyroid diseases (Hashimoto‚Äôs thyroiditis, Graves‚Äô disease). [80]The doses in these supplements are widely available and generally well-tolerated. The authors recommended additional trials to test the effectiveness of these supplements in younger populations and those at high risk of developing autoimmune diseases.
In an analysis of more than 427,000 White European participants using Mendelian randomization, a 54% higher risk of dementia was seen among participants with low vitamin D blood levels of <25 nmol/L compared with those having adequate levels of 50 nmol/L. [75]
Few foods are naturally rich in vitamin D3. The best sources are the flesh of fatty fish and fish liver oils. Smaller amounts are found in egg yolks, cheese, and beef liver. Certainmushroomscontain some vitamin D2; in addition some commercially sold mushrooms contain higher amounts of D2 due to intentionally being exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet light. Many foods and supplements are fortified with vitamin D like dairy products and cereals.
Vitamin D3 can be formed when a chemical reaction occurs in human skin, when a steroid called 7-dehydrocholesterol is broken down by the sun‚Äôs UVB light or so-called ‚Äútanning‚Äù rays. The amount of the vitamin absorbed can vary widely. The following are conditions that decrease exposure to UVB light and therefore lessen vitamin D absorption:
Note that because ultraviolet rays can cause skin cancer, it is important to avoid excessive sun exposure and in general, tanning beds should not be used.
Vitamin D deficiency may occur from a lack in the diet, poor absorption, or having a metabolic need for higher amounts. If one is not eating enough vitamin D and does not receive enough ultraviolet sun exposure over an extended period (see section above), a deficiency may arise. People who cannot tolerate or do not eat milk, eggs, and fish, such as those with a lactose intolerance or who follow a vegan diet, are at higher risk for a deficiency. Other people at high risk of vitamin D deficiency include:
Conditions resulting from prolonged vitamin D deficiency:
Vitamin D toxicity most often occurs from taking supplements. The low amounts of the vitamin found in food are unlikely to reach a toxic level, and a high amount of sun exposure does not lead to toxicity because excess heat on the skin prevents D3 from forming. It is advised to not take daily vitamin D supplements containing more than 4,000 IU unless monitored under the supervision of your doctor.
Symptoms of toxicity:
Catching the sun‚Äôs rays in a sunny office or driving in a car unfortunately won‚Äôt help to obtain vitamin D as window glass completely blocks UVB ultraviolet light.

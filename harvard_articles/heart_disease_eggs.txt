üîó Eggs and cholesterol back in the spotlight in new JAMA study
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2019/03/18/eggs-and-cholesterol-back-in-the-spotlight-in-new-jama-study/

Not again, you may be thinking if you‚Äôve come across the study by Zhong and colleagues, published in the March 15thissue ofJAMA. [1] Their question: Areeggsorcholesterolfrom foods associated with an increased risk ofcardiovascular disease(CVD) or deaths from any cause? The study was a pooled analysis of data from six prospective studies that had followed 29,615 U.S. men and women for up to 31 years.
The findings:
This study includes a relatively large sample and a long duration of follow-up. However, a major limitation is the use of a single measure of diet to look at outcomes up to 30 years later. During this time, some individuals may have changed their diet after developing high cholesterol or other conditions, which may influence the results of the study. These findings should be interpreted in the context ofseveral previous studies, which have shown that low to moderate egg intake is not associated with a higher risk of CVD in generally healthy people.
‚ÄúThese new findings may rekindle the debate about the role of dietary cholesterol and egg consumption in cardiovascular disease, but would not change general healthy eating guidelines that emphasize increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes and lowering consumption of red and processed meats and sugar,‚Äù saidDr. Frank Hu, Chair of theDepartment of Nutritionat the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúFor those who are generally healthy, low to moderate intake of eggs can be included as part of a healthy eating pattern, but they are not essential. For example, there is a range of other foods one can choose for a variety of healthful breakfasts, such as whole grain toast with nut butter, fresh fruits, and plain yogurt.‚Äù

üîó Study sheds light on dairy fat and cardiovascular disease risk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2016/10/25/dairy-fat-cardiovascular-disease-risk/

Until recently, when you visited the dairy aisle, chances are you headed straight for the blue carton of milk‚Äîthe skim milk that is. But recent buzz about dairy fat may cause shoppers to pause in front of the oft-shunned red carton of whole milk or other full-fat dairy products, as research suggests that their relationship toheart healthis more complex than was once believed. While most studies to date have focused on the association between dairyfatand cardiovascular riskfactors,few have examined the relationship to actualonsetof cardiovascular disease.
To address this gap in the literature, a new study by Harvard Chan School researchers published inThe American Journal of Clinical Nutritioninvestigated the relationship between dairy fat intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke. (1) Researchers followed more than 43,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, 87,000 women in theNurses‚Äô Health Study, and 90,000 women in the Nurses‚Äô Healthy Study II to study the relationship between dairy fat and heart disease risk. The detailed information collected over several decades allowed the investigators to adjust for smoking, physical activity, and other factors known to influence the development of heart disease. For dairy lovers, the good news is that various foods including full-fat dairy milk, yogurt, butter, cheeses, and cream were not found to increase heart disease risk (compared to a background diet that typically contains high amounts of refined carbohydrates and sugars). However, it is important to note that these foods were not found to decrease risk either.
What did predict risk of cardiovascular disease was ‚Äúfat swapping.‚Äù When dairy fat was replaced with the same number¬†of calories from vegetable fat or¬†polyunsaturated fat, the risk of cardiovascular disease dropped by 10% and 24%, respectively. Furthermore, replacing the same number¬†of calories from dairy fat with healthful carbohydrates from whole grains was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular disease.
Replacing dairy fat with other types of animal fat, such as from red meat, predicted a modest 6% higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
‚ÄúThese results suggest that dairy fat is not an optimal type of fat in our diets. Although one can enjoy moderate amounts of full-fat dairy such as cheese, a healthy diet pattern tends to be plant-based and low in saturated fat,‚Äù said Frank Hu, senior author of the study. ‚ÄúThese results strongly support existing recommendations to choose mainly unsaturated fats from vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and some oily fish for a heart-healthy diet.‚Äù
In terms of specific dairy products, Hu does not recommend regular consumption of full-fat milk or eating a lot of cheese, which is often paired with processed meats and refined flour in the form of hamburgers and pizza. Instead, small amounts of cheese can be consumed as a snack with fruits or whole-grain crackers. Among the range of dairy products, yogurt appears to have more health benefits. A cup of plain yogurt with nuts or fresh fruit for flavor and texture makes for asatisfying breakfastor healthy snack.

üîó Preventing Heart Disease
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/disease-prevention/cardiovascular-disease/preventing-cvd/

When heart experts talk about prevention, they usually refer to one of three types: secondary, primary and primordial prevention. [1]¬†All three have similar elements, but different starting times and different effects.
Five key lifestyle steps can dramatically reduce your chances of developing cardiovascular risk factors and ultimately heart disease:
1. Not smoking
One of the best things you can do for your health is to not use tobacco in any form. Tobacco use is a hard-to-break habit that can slow you down, make you sick, and shorten your life. One way it does this is by contributing to heart disease.
In fact, researchers examining the relationship between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on mortality during a decades-long perspective study of over 100,000 women found that approximately 64% of deaths among current smokers and 28% of deaths among former smokers were attributable to cigarette smoking. [2]
The nicotine that tobacco products deliver is one of the most addictive substances around. That makes tobacco use one of the toughest unhealthy habits to break. But don‚Äôt get discouraged; many smokers do quit! In fact, in the United States today there are more ex-smokers than smokers. [3]¬†Learn more about the hazards of smoking, the benefits of quitting, and tips for quitting from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
2. Maintaining a healthy weight
Excess weight and an extra-large waist size both contribute to heart disease, as well asa host of other health problems. [4-6]
In a study of over one million women, body-mass index (BMI) was a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease. The incidence of coronary heart disease increases progressively with BMI. [7]
In the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, middle-aged women and men who gained 11 to 22 pounds after age 20 were up to three times more likely to develop heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and gallstones than those who gained five pounds or fewer.
Weight and height go hand-in-hand. The taller you are, the more you weigh. That‚Äôs why researchers have devised several measures that account for both weight and height. The one most commonly used isBMI.
3. Exercising
Exercise andphysical activityare excellent ways to prevent heart disease and many other diseases and conditions, [14-16] but many of us getlessactivity as we get older.
4. Following a healthy diet
For years, research into connections between diet and heart disease focused on individual nutrients like cholesterol (and foods high in dietary cholesterol, likeeggs), types of fats, and specific vitamins and minerals. This work has been revealing, but it has also generated some dead ends, along with myths and confusion about what constitutes a heart-healthy diet. That‚Äôs because people eatfood, not nutrients.
5. Improving sleep health
Research has shown thatsleepis an essential component of cardiovascular health.
Other factors to consider
Along with these five practices, the American Heart Association recommends controlling cholesterol, managing blood sugar, and managing blood pressure as additional factors for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health. Learn more at theAmerican Heart Association‚Äôs ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Essential 8.‚Äù

You can help prevent heart disease by doing five key things and making them into habits:
Strong studies make it possible to link reductions in risk to these habits. Following a healthy lifestyle may prevent over 80% of cases of coronary artery disease, [24, 25] 50% of ischemic strokes, [26] 80% of sudden cardiac deaths, [27] and 72% of premature deaths related to heart disease. [28] In other words, a healthy lifestyle is a good investment in a longer, healthier life.

üîó Eggs
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/eggs/

Long-vilified for their high cholesterol content by well-meaning doctors and scientists researching heart disease, eggs now seem to be making a bit of a comeback. So what changed?
While it‚Äôs true that just one large egg yolk has 200 mg of cholesterol‚Äîmaking it one of the richest sources of dietary cholesterol‚Äîeggs also contain additional nutrients that may help lower the risk for heart disease. In addition, the moderate amount of fat in an egg, about 5 grams, is mostlymonounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat. It‚Äôs also crucial to distinguish betweendietary cholesterolandcholesterol in the blood,which are only weakly related. The focus on dietary cholesterol alone was de-emphasized as more attention was placed on the influence of saturated and trans fat on blood cholesterol. Accordingly, theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2015removed the prior recommendation to limit consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 mg per day. [1]
Given their history, ‚Äúare eggs healthy?‚Äù has become a frequently asked nutrition question. To answer this, it‚Äôs important to look at eggs not only on their own, but in context of the entire diet, especially when compared to foods they may replace (and vice-versa).
Food safety is a top priority when handling raw eggs. A contaminated hen can transmit Salmonella inside the egg if the shell has not completely formed. Salmonella can also penetrate egg shells, which have tiny open pores.
When purchasing eggs, you may notice the many choices available: ‚Äúfree-range,‚Äù ‚Äúfarm-fresh,‚Äù or ‚Äúvegetarian-fed.‚Äù This is a response by poultry farms to an increasing awareness on animal welfare as well as consumer health concerns. Many commercial farms raise chickens in battery cages that restrict most if not complete movement, as they are believed to be efficient for egg production. Some farms allow chickens to roam more freely and be exposed to fresh air and sunlight, prompting the new labeling terms. However, these terms are not regulated, so the amount of time and type of outdoor setting can vary depending on the farm. ¬†Welfare-related terms you may find on an egg carton in the United States include:
Labels may also feature designations unrelated to animal welfare, such as:

üîó Electrolyte Drinks
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/electrolyte-drinks/

Move over plain water? Commercial beverages in the U.S. aside from alcohol are a multi-billion-dollar industry and growing rapidly. Fueled by strong consumer interest in fitness and wellness, electrolyte orsports drinkscomprise a large share of the beverage market. They were originally created to prevent dehydration and electrolyte loss in young athletes who sweat and trained for hours in hot weather, which could hinder performance. Electrolyte beverages are designed to be easily absorbed in the gut to quickly rebalance mineral and fluid levels.
Eventually, marketing of the drinks shifted to a much larger audience: the non-athlete fitness enthusiast, which included anyone who donned a pair of sneakers for a weekly workout. Labeled ‚Äúhydration drinks,‚Äù they claim to hydrate even better than water. Others advertise a boost in energy and fitness performance thanks to added B vitamins and caffeine. Some containlow-calorie sweetenersto enhance flavor. They‚Äôre sold in ready-to-drink bottles or as supplements in tablet and powdered form that are added to plain water.
Electrolytes are minerals that have an electrical charge when dissolved in water. Electrical charges are needed to contract muscles, regulate heart rhythms, and maintain healthy fluid levels inside and outside of cells. Electrolyte minerals includesodium,potassium,magnesium,phosphorus,calcium, andchloride.
Because electrolytes are so vital to the body‚Äôs automatic functions, their blood levels are tightly regulated, meaning that your blood level does not always reflect how much you are eating (or not eating) of that mineral. Healthy kidneys can excrete excess amounts of electrolytes through urine if blood levels are too high (such as after eating a salt-loaded Italian sub) as well as hold onto body water if electrolyte levels are too low.
A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean protein foods naturally provides adequate amounts of electrolytes that our bodies need. But not everyone eats a consistently balanced diet, and certain medical conditions, drugs, and situations can cause dehydration and a deficiency in these minerals
Some beverages naturally contain electrolytes. Examples include:
Essentially any beverage containing electrolyte minerals may be labeled an electrolyte drink. Commercial electrolyte-branded waters and tablets contain varying ratios of electrolyte minerals. Some are very costly while offering only a small amount of these nutrients, while others may contain a high amount of only one nutrient such as potassium or sodium.
When an exercise workout is less than one hour and of lower intensity performed in moderate temperatures,plain wateris the best choice. Eating a balanced meal or a snack such as a banana with peanut butter,yogurtand pretzels, or chocolate milk shortly after a workout can naturally and safely replete electrolytes.
To save money and better control the ingredients, a homemade electrolyte drink is easy to make. The ratio of ingredients ‚Äì including electrolyte minerals, water, and a small amount of glucose in the form of sugar or honey ‚Äì enhances the absorption of fluid and electrolytes into the intestines.
Basic Electrolyte Water Recipe (makes about 1 liter):
Conditions that cause the body to lose large amounts of fluid in a short time increase the risk of nutrient depletion, as minerals are carried away with the fluid. Examples areexcessive diarrhea, vomiting, or sweatingthat can occur from viral infections, food-borne illnesses, gastrointestinal disorders, and strenuous physical activity usually longer than 1-2 hours such as withtrained athletes. Excessive alcohol intake can also cause the kidneys to excrete too much fluid from the body, carrying minerals with it.
Some medical conditions or medications reduce the absorption of minerals in the body, or require an increased intake of minerals. These include:
Electrolyte beverages andsports drinksare popular alternatives towaterbecause they add flavor and are touted to hydrate better than water. They are also heavily marketed through the billion-dollar beverage industry. Although electrolyte drinks may be useful for performance athletes who are regularly training or for those who have underlying medical conditions that place them at risk for electrolyte depletion, there is no evidence that these are healthier choices than water for the average person. Some commercial electrolyte beverages are costly, and contain extra calories from added sweeteners and high amounts of minerals like sodium that may have adverse effects in some people. Electrolytes can naturally be obtained from abalanced healthy diet.

üîó Preventing Obesity
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/preventing-obesity/

Let‚Äôs be clear: To make strides in reversing theobesity epidemic, changes must come from all parts of society‚Äîfrom governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organizations, neighborhoods and communities. Effective policies and programs are essential in ensuring that children and adults live, work, and play inenvironments that are conducive to healthy eatingand offeropportunities for physical activity.
Personal preferences and knowledge or beliefs can influence lifestyle choices, but there are so many complex factors that strongly impact individual behaviors. This page covers individual- and family-level strategies associated with maintaining a healthy weight, with the acknowledgement that we are too often fighting against a flood of accessible unhealthy options, persuasive advertising, and policies that make it far from easy.
Preventing weight gain over the years may not be possible for everyone, but there are strategies to help reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. Most of these strategies are covered in-depth throughout the website, so keep an eye out for links to more information below.
Nutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and ahealthy eating patternis crucial to good health. Additionally,howwe eat matters too.
Eat and drink these:
Eat and drink less of these:
How we eat and how much:
Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how much food you need each day to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it‚Äôs far too easy to overeat. Try the tips below to avoid overeating.
After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness. Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1. This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss. GLP-1 RAs also lower blood sugar by triggering the release of insulin. Early research has also found these drugs to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack.
GLP-1 RAs are used to treat both diabetes and obesity, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved specific dosages and brand names for each condition. Ozempic (semaglutide), Victoza (liraglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are prescribed for diabetes, and Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide) are prescribed for obesity. Rates of weight loss have been substantial, with tirzepatide achieving up to 21% weight loss in 18 months, comparable to 25-30% weight loss achieved with gastric bypass surgery. [1] Unpleasant side effects of GLP-1 RAs are mostly gastrointestinal, with 58% of users in one study reporting stomach pain; other common complaints are constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most of reported GI side effects appear to be mild and moderate. [2] Pancreatitis and gastroparesis (severely decreased stomach emptying) are less common but appear in a small percentage of users. Clinical trials such as SURMOUNT-4 and STEP 1 have shown that discontinuation of the medications causes weight regain, although it should be noted that these trials are authored by scientists who have affiliations with pharmaceutical companies that produce these medications. [3,4]
Shortages of GLP-1 RAs have led to the creation of falsified versions that are sold through unregulated outlets. They are discouraged by the World Health Organization, as falsified medications may lack efficacy, cause toxic reactions, and may be produced in unhygienic conditions that lead to bacterial contamination. [5]
Regular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions. In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit ‚Äúsit time‚Äù or being sedentary.SeeStaying Activefor further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages.
Watching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits.
Chronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight. Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise.SeeSleepfor more guidance.
Today‚Äôs world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities.
Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies.SeeStress and Healthfor more information and tips.

üîó Oral Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/

‚ÄúThere is no health without oral health.‚Äù You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.
Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth‚Äîparticularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person‚Äôs intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body‚Äôs process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body‚Äôs immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you‚Äôre having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn‚Äôt just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

üîó Avocados
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/avocados/

Avocados or ‚Äúalligator pears‚Äù are known for their creamy smooth flesh and bumpy skin. They are a popular food across many cultures. Perhaps best known as the star ingredient in guacamole, they are versatile and prepared in an array of dishes, or simply eaten plain with a spoon. Although not sweet, avocados are botanically classified as a fruit with a large berry and single center pit, grown from thePersea americanatree. They are believed to have originated in Mexico or Central America, with Mexico being the leading producer worldwide. [1]
Their nutrition profile makes them a staple in various healthful meal plans. Avocados are a good source of fiber, and contain more fat (the good kind) than carbohydrate, so are popular on lower-carbohydrate diets such as with diabetes. Their heart-friendly fats do not increase blood cholesterol, which can provide satisfaction on a traditional cholesterol-lowering diet that is often low in fat and cholesterol. It is one the highest-fat plant foods, making it a popular inclusion in vegan and vegetarian diets. The slightly earthy but neutral flavor of avocados works well in sauces, salad dressings, sandwiches, baked goods, salads, and grain dishes to add richness.
A whole medium avocado contains about 240 calories, 13 grams carbohydrate, 3 grams protein, 22 grams fat (15 grams monounsaturated, 4 grams polyunsaturated, 3 grams saturated), 10 grams fiber, and 11 milligrams sodium. Along with their low sodium levels, avocados contain no cholesterol.
Avocados contain several nutrients including carotenoids,monounsaturated fats,potassium, andfiberthat have been associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, especially when included as part of abalanced nutritious diet. The nutritional profile of avocados fits well with healthful dietary patterns such as theMediterraneanandDASHdiets. Published health research on avocados is largely funded by avocado industry groups; the research cited below attempts to include non-industry-funded studies.
The primary type of monounsaturated fat in avocados is from oleic acid, the main fatty acid in olive oil. Some studies show a reduction in LDL cholesterol when replacing other types of fat in the diet with avocados. [2] As with all plant foods, avocados are cholesterol-free. However, they contain phytosterols, or plant sterols, that have a similar chemical structure to cholesterol but are poorly absorbed in the intestines and therefore may interfere with cholesterol absorption. According to the American Heart Association, phytosterols have been found to reduce total and LDL cholesterol levels in the body by lowering cholesterol absorption. [3] Avocados are also rich in potassium, a mineral that helps to regulate blood pressure by maintaining normal levels of fluid inside of cells and helping muscles to contract. Potassium also works as an electrolyte that sends electrical signals in the heart to create a steady heartbeat.
A large cohort of almost 69,000 women and 42,000 men were followed for 30 years to see if long-term avocado intake affected risk ofcardiovascular disease(CVD). [4] The authors adjusted for diet and lifestyle factors associated with CVD to pinpoint the specific effect of avocados. Compared with those who didn‚Äôt eat avocados,those who ate two or more servingsa week (1 serving = ¬Ω avocado) had a 16% lower risk of CVD and a 21% lower risk of heart disease. The benefit was especially strong when swapping fat-filled foods like whole-milk dairy (butter, cheese, yogurt), processed meats (hot dogs, bacon, sausage), and eggs with an equal serving of avocado. However, there were similar heart benefits when swapping high-fat plant foods like nuts or olive oil with avocado.
Avocados are a good source of fiber, low in total carbohydrate, and rich in monounsaturated fats. They have alow glycemic index(GI) of about 40; low glycemic foods have a rating of 55 or less. Low GI foods are less likely to cause surges in blood glucose. Large epidemiological studies have found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated) fats can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. [5] These nutritional components are favorable for the prevention and control oftype 2 diabetes.
Avocados contain plant chemicals called carotenoids. Two types of these fat-soluble carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, are found in the human eye and protect the eye from ultraviolet light damage from the sun. A diet rich in these carotenoids is associated with a lower risk of macular degeneration and cataracts. [6]
The fibers in avocados act as prebiotics (food for beneficial bacteria in the intestines) and have been found to improve the diversity of microflora in the colon. [1] These bacteria digest and break down fibers intoshort chain fatty acids, which are actively researched for their role in chronic disease prevention.
Depending on the variety, avocados may be round or pear-shaped, green or black, and small or large. The skin is typically bumpy. The flesh when ripe is smooth and buttery. They are a climacteric fruit, which continues to ripen after harvesting. The Hass avocado is the most common type, available year-round.
If you are planning to use an avocado immediately after purchase, choose a ripe one with dark green or almost black skin. It should yield to pressure when squeezed. Avocados with light green skin that are very firm are unripe and will need to sit a few days before eating. If the avocado has dark shriveled skin, dents, or spots of mushy flesh, it may be overripe and unpleasant to eat.
Avocado oil is extracted from the flesh of pressed avocados. It can replace other liquid cooking oils and has a very high smoke point of almost 500¬∞F. Avocado oil is often compared with olive oil because they are both rich in the fatty acid, oleic acid, but avocado oil has a more neutral flavor. [7] It can also be used to make a homemade salad dressing: whisk or blend together ¬º cup avocado oil, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, and 4 teaspoons balsamic or apple cider vinegar; add additional low-sodium spices like black pepper or garlic powder as desired.
Avocados are often sold with hard, unripe flesh, which will ripen in 2-3 days. You can leave the fruit at room temperature, or place in direct sunlight to speed ripening. You can also place the avocado sealed in a paper bag with abanana; the ethylene gases in the banana will speed ripening. When ripe, avocados will feel slightly soft when squeezed. The flesh of avocados is infamous for quickly turning brown once exposed to air, called enzymatic browning. Although unappetizing to see, the brown flesh is perfectly edible. Still, there are tips to slow or reduce browning after cutting into an avocado:
Removing an avocado pit isn‚Äôt as challenging as you might think. Although a popular method is to stab a knife into the pit of an avocado half and cleanly remove it, this carries the potential danger of stabbing your hand! Instead, place your index and middle finger on the flesh on each side of the pit, placing your thumb behind the avocado on the skin; push into the center with your thumb until the pit pops out. From there, slice, dice, or mash the flesh as desired to be used in recipes.
The monounsaturated fat in avocados is stable in high heat and can be used not only in cooking but also in baking. Pureed avocado can be substituted for butter or oil in baking recipes, using a 1:1 ratio (1 cup butter = 1 cup avocado).
Here are some ideas to use avocado:

üîó Diet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that ‚Äúinflammation‚Äù is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by ourimmune system. When a foreign invader enters the body such as bacteria, viruses, or allergens, or an injury occurs, our immune cells act quickly. We may sneeze or cough to rid the body of an offending agent. We may feel pain and swelling at the site of a cut or injury to signal us to be gentle with this delicate area. Blood flows in rapidly, which may produce warmth or redness. These are signs that our immune system is repairing damaged tissue or fighting invaders. As healing takes place, inflammation gradually subsides.
Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state. Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body‚Äôs immune system to constantly attack cells. This sometimes occurs with autoimmune disorders like lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn‚Äôs disease. Sometimes an unhealthy lifestyle from lack of exercise, high stress, and calorie-rich diets can trigger chronic low levels of inflammation throughout the entire body, termed metaflammation. [1,2] This type of low-grade inflammation does not usually produce noticeable symptoms, but over time metaflammation can pave the pathway for chronic conditions likecardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and certaincancers(e.g., breast, colon).
Anti-inflammatory diets may be promoted for these inflammatory conditions. They include several foods that are believed to interfere with the inflammatory process, though research on its exact mechanism is not conclusive. There is no single anti-inflammatory diet plan. Generally it emphasizes eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, minimally refined whole grains, tea, coffee, herbs, spices, and oily fish. TheMediterranean dietandDASH dietare popular dietary plans that already showcase many anti-inflammatory foods.
An anti-inflammatory diet plan not only highlights specific foods and food groups but limits other foods that may contribute to metaflammation such as fatty cuts ofred meat,refined sugary foodsandbeverages, and excessalcohol.
An anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes. It suggests a variety of anti-inflammatory foods to eat daily, rather than focusing on eating one or two specific foods or nutrients. This ensures a greater variety of protective food components, some of which may work synergistically toboost immunity. These foods provide plant chemicals (phytochemicals), antioxidants, and fiber that prevent cellular stresses, inhibit inflammatory signals caused by the immune system, promote healthygut microbiota, and slow down digestion to prevent surges in blood glucose. [3] They may also favorably affect the composition of fat cells to further reduce inflammation.
Other factors aside from diet may help to control inflammation, such asexercising regularly,controlling stress, andgetting enough sleep.
Most available research focuses on foods and dietary patterns that are associated with metaflammation, which in turn helps to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Metaflammation is especially associated with Western-type dietary patterns high in processed meats, saturated fat, refined sugars, salt, and white flour while being low in fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals. [1,4] These diets also tend to be calorie-dense with a high glycemic load, potentially leading toblood sugar surges, insulin resistance, and excess weight gain. Studies have shown that Western diets are associated with increased blood markers of inflammation, though the connection may be due to a string of events rather than one direct action. [1] For example, exposure to air pollution and chronic mental stress can lead to an excess of free radicals produced in the body, which then oxidize and damage other molecules. Atherosclerosis is one condition in which these free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol particles. The actions of both oxidized LDL cholesterol and several types of immune cells form lesions and plaque in the heart arteries that can lead to ischemicheart disease(a type of heart disease caused by narrowed or partially blocked arteries). [5] A long-term diet that is high in saturated fat andcholesterolmay raise LDL levels, increasing the risk of free radical action that may promote this immune response, which partially contributes to a chronic low-level proinflammatory state.
A major cause of low-level inflammation is the build-up of fatty acids in fat tissue (and other tissues) promoted by a high-fat or high-sugar diet. This may cause fat tissue to send signals to immune cells that produce inflammation in various areas, including organs like the pancreas. An inflamed pancreas can then lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, the combination of carrying extra body fat (obesity) and eating a diet high in saturated fat and refined sugars increases the risk of cell damage because of increased immune cell activity.
An anti-inflammatory diet contains foods rich in nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals and limits foods found in a typical Western diet to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. There is also emerging research studying the effects of high-fiber plant-rich diets that support a greater diversity ofbeneficial gut microbes, which may prevent a condition called metabolic endotoxemia. This is a low-grade inflammation that occurs because of an increase in the number of endotoxins, which are believed to cause the inflammation associated with metabolic diseases likecardiovascular diseaseandtype 2 diabetes. [6,7]
The most common causes of leaky gut are drug abuse and food toxins (for example, gluten acting as a toxin in susceptible people with celiac disease). Certain nutrients, such as the amino acids glutamine and tryptophan, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease intestinal permeability by improving the tight junctions. [28]Fiberin the diet can improve the diversity of bacteria in the gut that increases production of short chain fatty acids and other beneficial metabolites, which in turn strengthens the intestinal barrier. Foods rich inprebiotics and probiotics, and probiotic supplements, are also being studied. Much more research is needed to confirm the relationship of dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions, and potential treatments.
An anti-inflammatory diet is a healthful eating plan that may help to reduce chronic low levels of inflammation that otherwise might increase the risk of various chronic diseases. Although research is limited, it may also help to lower inflammatory markers in individuals with autoimmune-type inflammation such as with rheumatoid arthritis. Popular dietary patterns that are anti-inflammatory include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and vegetarian diets. People may seek the guidance of a registered dietitian familiar with any of these dietary patterns to assist with meal planning and appropriate portion sizes. Along with the diet, it is important to incorporate other healthy lifestyle factors that positively affect the body‚Äôs immune response, such as practicingstress reduction,exercising regularly, and getting adequatesleep.

üîó Iodine
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/iodine/

Iodine is an essential trace mineral not made by the body so must be obtained by food or supplements. It is found naturally in some foods and is added to supplements and some salt seasonings. Iodine is needed to make the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which assist with the creation of proteins and enzyme activity, as well as regulating normal metabolism. Without enough iodine, these thyroid hormones do not work properly and can lead to an under-active or overactive thyroid gland, causing the medical conditions of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism with various negative side effects in the body.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance for iodine is 150 micrograms (mcg) daily for adult men and women 19+ years, and 220 and 290 mcg daily for pregnant and lactating women, respectively. [1,2]
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. The UL for iodine for adults 19+ years and pregnant and lactating women is 1,100 mcg daily.
Production of thyroid hormones increases during pregnancy, requiring higher intakes of iodine. Both the fetus and infant require enough iodine for normal physical growth and brain development. Breast milk contains iodine, though the amount will depend on the mother‚Äôs diet, and many infant formulas contain iodine. However, not all prenatal multivitamins contain iodine. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that prenatal and lactating women take supplemental iodine by using iodized salt. [2] High-dose iodine supplements are not always advised, as they can cause thyroid problems in some women.
Moderate to severe iodine deficiency in children can cause a lower IQ and stunted growth. Iodine supplementation in these children appears to improve both their physical and mental development.
These conditions occur when the body produce too little (hypothyroidism) or too much (hyperthyroidism) thyroid hormone. An early sign of hypothyroidism is having an elevated blood level of of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This may occur with low intakes of iodine. It may also occur in people with a history of iodine deficiency who take high doses of iodine such as in supplements. [1] Goiter, a lump in the front of the neck from an enlarged inflamed thyroid gland, can result from hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or an excessive iodine intake (usually involves taking very high doses of more than 18,000 mcg a day for a prolonged time). [1] Relatedly,goitrogensin some cruciferous vegetables can prevent the absorption of iodine, which may then interfere with thyroid function and cause goiter. Those already with an iodine deficiency or hypothyroidism are most susceptible.
Iodine is found in soil and the ocean, which varies in amount and will affect how much of the mineral is contained in a food. Iodine is found mainly in animal protein foods and sea vegetables, and to a lesser extent in fortified foods like breads, cereals, and milk.
Iodine regulates metabolism, the conversion of energy obtained from food into energy to help cells function and grow. A deficiency of iodine can therefore prevent normal growth and development. This is especially dangerous in pregnant women and infants, in which miscarriage, stillbirth, stunted growth, and cognitive impairments (difficulties with reading, writing, talking, problem solving, social skills) can occur. In adults, an iodine deficiency of less than 10-20 mcg a day can lead to inadequate thyroid hormone production, called hypothyroidism, which disrupts normal metabolic functions like regulating heart rate, body temperature, and body weight. [2] A lump or swelling in the neck, called goiter, often accompanies hypothyroidism. Other signs of hypothyroidism include:
People at risk for iodine deficiency include those who do not use iodized salt or supplements containing iodine, pregnant women, vegans who do not eat any animal foods, and those living in areas with low levels of iodine in the soil (e.g., mountainous regions).
High iodine intakes are usually well-tolerated in most healthy people and do not cause problems. [1] This has been observed in countries such as Japan and Korea that eat iodine-rich seaweed regularly. [3] But some people with autoimmune thyroid disease or who have a history of chronic iodine deficiency can be sensitive to receiving extra iodine, inducing conditions of iodine deficiency like hypothyroidism and goiter. [2,4] Excess iodine can also lead to too much thyroid hormone production, causing hyperthyroidism; signs of this condition are an increased metabolism that promotes weight loss, fast or irregular heartbeat, hand tremors, irritability, fatigue, and sweatiness. Sometimes even just a slight increase in dietary iodine above the RDA can cause iodine-induced hyperthyroidism in sensitive individuals. [4]
Some epidemiologic studies have shown that high seaweed intakes are associated with an increased risk of certain types of thyroid cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women, but the exact mechanism is unclear. [2,3]
Excess iodine intake may come from use of high-dose supplements or overeating certain seaweeds and salts that contain iodine. Severe iodine poisoning is rare, but symptoms include fever; stomach pain; nausea; vomiting; a burning sensation of the mouth, throat, and stomach; and even coma. [2] Children, infants, the elderly, and those with existing thyroid disease are particularly vulnerable to iodine toxicity and iodine-induced hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. [3,4]

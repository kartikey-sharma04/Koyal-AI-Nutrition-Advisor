üîó Precision Nutrition
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/precision-nutrition/

Precision nutrition may sound like a new fad diet, but it is actually a credible emerging area of research supported by the National Institutes of Health under the umbrella of precision medicine. [1,2] Precision medicine seeks to improve the personalized treatment of diseases, and precision nutrition is specific to dietary intake. Both develop interventions to prevent or treat chronic diseases based on a person‚Äôs unique characteristics like DNA, race, gender, health history, and lifestyle habits. Both aim to provide safer and more effective ways to prevent and treat disease by providing more accurate and targeted strategies. Precision nutrition assumes that each person may have a different response to specific foods and nutrients, so that the best diet for one individual may look very different than the best diet for another. How often are we tempted to follow a flashy diet that a celebrity or friend promoted in helping them to lose 20 pounds or ‚Äúcure‚Äù their diabetes? The concept of precision nutrition would discourage this practice, as our individual blueprint might require a unique dietary plan to be successful.
Precision nutrition also considers themicrobiome, trillions of bacteria in our bodies that play a key role in various daily internal operations. What types and how much bacteria we have are unique to each individual. Our diets can determine which types of bacteria live in our digestive tracts, and according to precision nutrition the reverse is also true: the types of bacteria we house might determine how we break down certain foods and what types of foods are most beneficial for our bodies.
Precision nutrition, also referred to as personalized nutrition, focuses on the individual rather than groups of people. Many research studies on nutrition and types of diets provide useful information for communities and the general population. High-quality nutrition studies have shown that for the average person, eating more vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while eating less highly processed foods made with added sugars and salt can help reduce the risk of various diseases. Yet, when studies such as the PREDICT 1 trial focus on individual responses to food, they have found substantial variations in blood responses of glucose and triglycerides even if individuals are eating identical meals. [3] The person‚Äôs microbiome was found to cause variations in blood triglycerides after a meal. Non-food factors like sleep, physical activity, and time of meals also played a role in causing variations in blood levels of glucose and triglycerides after meals. [3] Therefore, an individual may see additional benefits if following personalized nutrition guidance beyond general health recommendations. Precision nutrition evaluates one‚Äôs DNA, microbiome, and metabolic response to specific foods or dietary patterns to determine the most effective eating plan to prevent or treat disease.
There are specific dietary treatments based on genetic data that have been used for years: agluten-free diet for the management of celiac disease, a lactose-free diet for those with lactose intolerance, and the avoidance of dietary phenylalanine (an amino acid in protein foods and some artificial sweeteners) for an inherited disorder called phenylketonuria (or PKU). However precision nutrition is in its early stages and too soon to introduce as a treatment for chronic diseases in the general population. Research is being conducted on the application of precision nutrition for obesity, metabolic syndrome, certain cancers, and type 2diabetes(T2DM).
For example, the traditional management of T2DM targets healthy lifestyle factors (exercise,diet, achieving ahealthy weight), often with use of medications. Precision nutrition can further tailor diabetes management by looking closely at the following areas: [4,5]
Precision nutrition examines how a person‚Äôs DNA may be associated with their response to a food. One example is coffee. Ever notice how some people are unfazed after drinking cup after cup of coffee during the day, while you may feel jittery and high-strung after only one cup?Coffeebeans contain plant chemicals with health benefits but not everyone can tolerate the side effects from the caffeine content. Research has discovered genes specifically related to coffee intake. [6] These genes may determine how fast or slowly the caffeine in coffee is metabolized. They are also associated with anti-inflammatory effects and a lower risk of certain chronic diseases. Precision nutrition uses genetic data such as this to determine if an individual would benefit from drinking more or less coffee.
Other factors being researched include seeing if a high intake of saturated fat may predispose an individual to weight gain, or if a high salt intake increases one‚Äôs risk of developing high blood pressure. [7] However, findings from these studies have not been replicated in different populations.
The field of precision nutrition is not yet ready for prime time because of various challenges‚Äîa lack of well-designed clinical trials showing consistent results, and expensive technologies needed to collect and study an individual‚Äôs DNA, gut microbiome, and response to food intake. [4] Dietary interventions such as these require high-quality evidence of their effectiveness and consistency before they may be recommended for use alongside or even to replace conventional interventions for a particular disease. There may also be differences among findings in clinical trials of the individual metabolic response to a specific diet depending on the types of tests they use; this in turn could cause variation in the personalized nutrition recommendations that are provided.
Primary care physicians, registered dietitians, and other providers directly interacting with an individual need to be educated about precision nutrition, as it requires the combined joint efforts of the entire health care team. Despite individual differences in metabolic response to foods, personalized dietary advice should still align with general nutrition principles (e.g. eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming less added sugar from sugary drinks, limiting sodium, etc.). Although private companies have started to offer genetic and microbiome testing to the public to customize diets, more research needs to be done on the effectiveness and accuracy of these tests.
Ethical and legal aspects of implementing precision nutrition should also be considered, including protecting consumer privacy in the use of precision nutrition technologies and tests. It‚Äôs also important to recognize that personalized approaches may be accessible to only a small segment of the population, which can widen health disparities. We must not lose sight of improving the broader food environment through effective policies, regulations, and other population-based approaches that can help make healthy food choices the default.

üîó Niacin ‚Äì Vitamin B3
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/niacin-vitamin-b3/

Niacin, or vitamin B3, is a water-solubleB vitaminfound naturally in some foods, added to foods, and sold as a supplement. The two most common forms of niacin in food and supplements are nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. The body can also convert tryptophan‚Äîan amino acid‚Äîto nicotinamide. Niacin is water-soluble so that excess amounts the body does not need are excreted in the urine. Niacin works in the body as a coenzyme, with more than 400 enzymes dependent on it for various reactions. Niacin helps to convert nutrients into energy, create cholesterol and fats, create and repair DNA, and exert antioxidant effects. [1,2]
RDA:Niacin is measured in milligrams (mg) of niacin equivalents (NE). One NE equals 1 milligram of niacin or 60 mg of tryptophan. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 16 mg NE for men, 14 mg NE for women, 18 mg NE for pregnant women, and 17 mg NE for lactating women.
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for niacin for all adults 19+ years is 35 milligrams.
For more than 40 years, niacin in the form of nicotinic acid has been given to patients to treat a condition called dyslipidemia, a major risk factor forcardiovascular diseases (CVD)such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, and strokes. Bloodwork in someone with dyslipidemia may show high total and LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol levels, low HDL ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides.
Nicotinic acid supplements contain high amounts, up to 1,000-2,000 mg of niacin taken daily. Studies have shown that they can increase HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, negative side effects (skin flushing, stomach upset, diarrhea) usually accompany the supplements, resulting in poor compliance from patients. Clinical trials have not consistently shown that nicotinic acid leads to less cardiovascular events or deaths from CVD.
A severe niacin deficiency has been associated with cognitive decline such as memory loss and dementia. Niacin is believed to protect brain cells from stress and injury. It is not yet clear though if smaller variations in dietary niacin intake can negatively affect brain function.
Research in this area is limited but there are several clinical trials underway that may shed further light on niacin‚Äôs effects on brain health. [9]
A niacin deficiency is rare because it is found in many foods, both from animals and plants.
Niacin is available as asupplementin the form of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide. Sometimes the amounts in supplements are far beyond the RDA, causing unpleasant side effects of flushing. Niacin supplements are also available as a prescription medicine that is used to treat high cholesterol; this typically comes in an extended release form of nicotinic acid that allows slower, more gradual absorption so that it does not cause flushing. Because of the very high doses of nicotinic acid needed, up to 2,000 mg daily, this supplement should only be used when monitored by a physician.
A niacin deficiency is rare in the United States and other industrialized countries because it is well-absorbed from most foods (with the exception of some cereal grains in which niacin is bound to its fibers, decreasing the absorption) and is added to many foods and multivitamins. A severe niacin deficiency leads to pellagra, a condition that causes a dark, sometimes scaly rash to develop on skin areas exposed to sunlight; bright redness of the tongue; and constipation/diarrhea. Other signs of severe niacin deficiency include:
Groups at risk for deficiency
Toxicity when eating foods containing niacin is rare, but can occur from long-term use of high-dose supplements. A reddened skin flush with itchiness or tingling on the face, arms, and chest is a common sign. Flushing occurs mainly when taking high-dosage supplements in the form of nicotinic acid, rather than nicotinamide. Niacin taken in large doses as supplements may also increase uric acid levels, which is a risk factor for gout.

üîó Water
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/water/

There are many options forwhat to drink, but water is the best choice for most people who have access to safe drinking water. It is calorie-free and as easy to find as the nearest tap.
Water helps to restore fluids lost through metabolism, breathing, sweating, and the removal of waste. It helps to keep you from overheating, lubricates the joints and tissues, maintains healthy skin, and is necessary for proper digestion. It‚Äôs the perfect zero-calorie beverage for quenching thirst and rehydrating your body.
Water is an essential nutrient at every age, so optimal hydration is a key component for good health. Water accounts for about 60% of an adult‚Äôs body weight. We drink fluids when we feel thirst, the major signal alerting us when our body runs low on water. We also customarily drink beverages with meals to help with digestion. But sometimes we drink not based on these factors but on how much we think we should be drinking. One of the most familiar sayings is to aim for ‚Äú8 glasses a day,‚Äù but this may not be appropriate for every person.
TheNational Academy of Medicine suggestsan adequate intake of daily fluids of about 13 cups and 9 cups for healthy men and women, respectively, with 1 cup equaling 8 ounces. Higher amounts may be needed for those who are physically active or exposed to very warm climates. Lower amounts may be needed for those with smaller body sizes (the chart below lists daily water intake based on age group from the National Academy of Medicine). It‚Äôs important to note that these amounts are not a daily target, but a general guide. In the average person, drinking less will not necessarily compromise one‚Äôs health as each person‚Äôs exact fluid needs vary, even day-to-day.
Like most trends of the moment, alkaline water has become popular through celebrity backing with claims ranging from weight loss to curing cancer. The theory behind alkaline water is the same as that touting the benefits of eating alkaline foods, which purportedly counterbalances the health detriments caused by eating acid-producing foods like meat, sugar, and some grains.
From a scale of 0-14, a higher pH number is alkaline; a lower pH is acidic. The body tightly regulates blood pH levels to about 7.4 because veering away from this number to either extreme can cause negative side effects and even be life-threatening. However, diet alone cannot cause these extremes; they most commonly occur with conditions like uncontrolled diabetes, kidney disease, chronic lung disease, or alcohol abuse.
Alkaline water has a higher pH of about 8-9 than tap water of about 7, due to a higher mineral or salt content. Some water sources can be naturally alkaline if the water picks up minerals as it passes over rocks. However, most commercial brands of alkaline water have been manufactured using an ionizer that reportedly separates out the alkaline components and filters out the acid components, raising the pH. Some people add an alkaline substance like baking soda to regular water.
Scientific evidence is not conclusive on the acid-alkaline theory, also called the acid-ash theory, stating that eating a high amount of certain foods can slightly lower the pH of blood especially in the absence of eating foods supporting a higher alkaline blood pH like fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Controlled clinical trials have not shown that diet alone can significantly change the blood pH of healthy people. Moreover, a direct connection of blood pH in the low-normal range and chronic disease in humans has not been established.
BOTTOM LINE:If the idea of alkaline water encourages you to drink more, then go for it! But it‚Äôs likely that drinking plain regular water will provide similar health benefits from simply being well-hydrated‚Äîimproved energy, mood, and digestive health
A healthy body is designed to send thirst signals when the body becomes depleted of fluids. Thirst is the desire to drink, and is not only driven by physiological cues but behavioral cues. An example of a behavioral prompt is water temperature; research suggests that people tend to drink the most water when it is served at room temperature even though cooler drinks are rated as most pleasing to taste. We are also often influenced to drink (and eat) more in social settings.
As we age, however, the body‚Äôs regulation of fluid intake and thirst decline. Research has shown that both of these factors are impaired in the elderly.A Cochrane review foundthat commonly used indicators of dehydration in older adults (e.g., urine color and volume, feeling thirsty) are not effective and should not be solely used. Certain conditions that impair mental ability and cognition, such as a stroke or dementia, can also impair thirst. People may also voluntarily limit drinking due to incontinence or difficulty getting to a bathroom.
In addition to these situations,research has foundthat athletes, people who are ill, and infants may not have an adequate sense of thirst to replete their fluid needs. Even mild dehydration may produce negative symptoms, so people who cannot rely on thirst or other usual measures may wish to use other strategies. For example, aim to fill a 20-ounce water bottle four times daily and sip throughout the day, or drink a large glass of water with each meal and snack.
These symptoms of dehydration may occur with as little as a 2% water deficit:
Dehydration can increase the risk of certain medical conditions:
There is no Tolerable Upper Intake Level for water because the body can usually excrete extra water through urine or sweat.
However, a condition called water toxicity is possible in rare cases, in which a large amount of fluids is taken in a short amount of time, which is faster than the kidney‚Äôs ability to excrete it. This leads to a dangerous condition called hyponatremia in which blood levels of sodium fall too low as too much water is taken. The excess total body water dilutes blood sodium levels, which can cause symptoms like confusion, nausea, seizures, and muscle spasms.
Water is an excellent calorie-free, sugar-free choice.¬† For some people who are accustomed to drinkingsweet beverages, water can initially taste bland. To increase water consumption without losing flavor or to spice up your daily water intake, try these refreshing water-based beverages:
Instead of purchasing expensive flavored waters in the grocery store, you can easily make your own at home. Try adding any of the following to a cold glass or pitcher of water:
Sparkling juices may have as many calories as sugary soda. Instead, make your own sparkling juice at home with 12 ounces of sparkling water and just an ounce or two of juice. For additional flavor, add sliced citrus or fresh herbs like mint.
For thehealth of the planet, reconsider relying on single-use plastic water bottles and purchase a colorful 20-32 ounce refillable water thermos that is easy to wash and tote with you during the day.
Water becomes bubbly through the process of carbonation and is sometimes suggested as a healthier alternative to soda. Carbonation involves dissolving carbon dioxide gas in water under high pressure; when the pressure is released, bubbles form. This process lowers the pH of water from 7 to 4, which is more acidic. The acid level has raised concerns that seltzer and soda water may harm dental enamel or bone health. However,research has not shownthat carbonated beverages are associated with dental decay unless they also contain sugar or other sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup. Furthermore, studies have not found that carbonated beverages are associated with decreased bone mineral density; the culprit is more likely thehigh phosphorus contentspecific to dark cola soft drinks than the carbonation.
BOTTOM LINE:Carbonated waters, if unsweetened, are safe to drink and a good beverage choice. They are not associated with health problems that are linked withsweetened, carbonated beverageslike soda. However, while it is great to replace soda with carbonated water, for oral health, it should not be used as a replacement forwater with fluoride.

üîó Energy Drinks
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/energy-drinks/

Plain water is the best hydrating beverage for most people, but sports and energy drinks are advertised to appeal to those who exercise or need a boost of energy to get through the day.
Though sometimes confused withsports beverages, energy drinks are a different product entirely. They are marketed to increase alertness and energy levels, containing significant amounts ofcaffeineand as much or more sugar as in soda. Many energy drinks pack about 200 mg of caffeine, the amount in two cups of brewed coffee. Other substances purported to increase energy may be added, likeB vitaminsand herbs such as ginseng and guarana. Most concerning is a lack of regulation about the safety of these drinks, as well as aggressive marketing tactics geared toward adolescents. [1] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2007, 1,145 adolescents ages 12 to 17 went to the emergency room for an energy drink-related emergency. In 2011 that number climbed to 1,499. [2]
After water, sugar is the main ingredient in energy drinks. A nutritional comparison shows that a 12-ounce cola drink contains about 39 grams of sugar, 41 grams of sugar in an energy drink. Research has found that consuminghigh-sugar drinksof any kind can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and gout.
Because of the amount of sugar and stimulant ingredients, there is concern that these beverages may not be helpful, and even worse, harmful to adolescents and people with certain health conditions.
Sipping a beverage that offers quick energy may appeal to people who feel fatigued or who believe the caffeine can provide an edge when exercising or playing competitive sports. Although statements on the websites of energy drinks warn that these beverages may not be suitable for children, youth are among their largest consumers. An energy drink may be used by adolescents or college students cramming for exams through the night, or by a young athlete before an important game. While it is true that some controlled trials have shown temporary improved alertness and reversal of fatigue after taking energy drinks, as well as enhanced physical performance in young athletes, the majority of studies show an association with negative health effects. These include increased stress, aggressive behaviors like fighting, alcohol/cigarette abuse, increased blood pressure, increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, poor sleep quality, and stomach irritation. [1]
A typical energy drink may contain the following: carbonated water, around 40 grams of sugar (from sucrose and/or glucose), 160 mg or more of caffeine,artificial sweetener, and herbs/substances associated with mental alertness and performance but that lack scientific evidence with controlled trials (taurine, panax ginseng root extract, L-carnitine, L-tartarate, guarana seed extract, B vitamins).
Water that is calorie-free and accessible without cost to most people is the beverage of choice taken with and between meals. Energy drinks are a source ofcaffeinethat people may choose as an alternative to coffee or tea. However, they also contain high amounts of sugar, vitamins, and herbs that may not be necessary for the average person. Energy drinks can pose a health risk in vulnerable groups including children, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with medical conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adults who choose to consume energy drinks should check the label for caffeine content and avoid high consumption (over 200 mg of caffeine per drink); consumption in combination with alcohol should be avoided. [9] Pediatricians should discuss the use of energy drinks with their young patients and parents to ensure that all are aware of the health risks, and if used, are monitored carefully. [7]

üîó Tea
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/tea/

Tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water. It‚Äôs a simple preparation of pouring hot water over cured leaves of theCamellia sinensisplant. The first recording of tea described it as a medicinal beverage in China in the 3rdcentury AD. Merchants helped its popularity to spread quickly across continents. In the early 19thcentury, Great Britain popularized the concept of afternoon tea, a break from one‚Äôs routine in which tea is served alongside sandwiches and baked goods such as scones. The flavor of tea varies by where the tea leaves are harvested and how they are grown and processed. Black tea is the most popular worldwide, followed by green, oolong, and white tea. [1]
Herbal teas are not made from theCamelliaplant but from dried herbs, spices, flowers, fruit, seeds, roots, or leaves of other plants; they do not typically contain caffeine as do traditional teas.
Most traditional teas do not contain a significant amount of nutrients, but are rich in polyphenols. These are plant chemicals that give teas their distinct flavor and aroma and may have health-promoting properties.
Animal studies suggest potential health benefits of tea due to its high polyphenol content. Human studies have generally been less conclusive, yet show promise. Observational research has found that tea consumption of 2-3 cups daily is associated with a reduced risk of premature death, heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. [2] However, there may be an increased risk of esophageal and stomach cancers from drinking tea that is too hot (more than 131-140¬∞ F [55-60¬∞ C]). [2,3] Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm if these healthful and harmful associations are causal. In the meantime, there appears to be little risk associated with drinking tea except for frequent consumption of very hot tea. So pick a color, let it cool, and enjoy a cup!
Indeed, one reason for conflicting results in observational studies may be the wide variations in tea types with varying flavonoid content. [4] Where the tea leaves are grown, the specific blend of tea leaves, type of processing, and addition of ingredients such as milk, honey, and lemon can alter specific flavonoid content. How accurately people report their tea intake (e.g., type, amount, brew strength) and their overall diet (e.g., do they eat other foods rich in flavonoids?) are other factors that need to be clarified as they can affect study results. For example:
Learn more about some of the research on tea on health:
A Cochrane review found very few large, long-term studies that examined green or black tea for the primary prevention ofcardiovascular disease. The authors noted that tea appears to show favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors based on the available evidence, but this is based on only a modest number of small, short-term clinical trials so firm conclusions cannot be made. [8]
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea has been shown in animal and cell studies to prevent the growth of cancer cells and cause them to die. [1] Green and black tea extracts have been shown in animal studies to reduce the risk or delay the progression of cancer. [21] Green tea might also have a positive effect in reducing risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, and endometrial cancers, though evidence is limited. [22] A meta-analysis of 41 prospective studies found no decreased risk of five cancers (breast, colorectal, liver, prostate, stomach) with black tea intake (about 3 cups daily). [21] Overall, human studies about tea and cancer are limited and results are inconsistent. Learn more aboutcancer and antioxidants.
A positive association has been found between drinking hot tea and a greater risk of esophageal cancer. It is believed that very hot beverages may cause cell injury that could lead to cancer. [3] Studies showing this association with tea have been largely in Asia and the Middle East. There is less evidence in Western populations, where beverages including coffee and tea are usually consumed at more moderate temperatures. Westerners also may add milk or cream to very hot beverages, immediately lowering the temperature. A meta-analysis of 16 case-control studies conducted in China, India, Iran and other countries in Europe and South America found an association of increased risk of esophageal cancer with higher consumption of both very hot beverages and foods. [23] It appears that cancer risk of this type is directly linked to temperature, rather than a specific component of the food or beverage.
A large prospective study of 50,045 Iranian men and women followed for about 10 years found a 90% increased risk of esophageal cancer when comparing those drinking ‚Äúvery hot‚Äù versus ‚Äúcold/lukewarm‚Äù tea. It also found that the shorter the time from pouring the tea into a cup to drinking it was associated with increased risk. In May 2016, after a review of available research, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that ‚Äúdrinking very hot beverages above 65 C (140 F)‚Äù is ‚Äúprobably carcinogenic.‚Äù [3] They acknowledged certain limitations of existing studies that precluded listing a ‚Äúcarcinogenic‚Äù label, one being that data on the actual temperature of tea are self-reported, in which the perception of ‚Äúhot‚Äù may vary among ethnicities and populations.
In 2018, a large cohort study of 456,155 men and women in China followed for a median of nine years found that participants who drank burning-hot tea daily along with excessive alcohol had five times the risk of developing esophageal cancer than those who drank less of both beverages. Those who drank burning-hot tea daily and smoked tobacco had double the risk of developing this cancer. [24]
To decaffeinate tea, there are different methods. One process uses an organic chemical solvent (either ethyl acetate or methylene chloride) that also removes most of tea‚Äôs polyphenols. The residual amount of the chemical after processing is minimal to none, and no research has shown negative health effects. Another method called ‚Äúeffervescence‚Äù uses water and carbon dioxide, which retains the majority of polyphenols. Both methods apply the chemical or gas onto moistened tea leaves, which bonds to the caffeine; when the leaves are dried, the caffeine evaporates along with the solvent/gas. If you wish to know which processing method is used, check the package label or contact the manufacturer.
Herbal teas are naturally caffeine-free and do not undergo a decaffeination process.
Most research looks at the health effects of traditional teas, not decaffeinated. Decaffeinated tea may lose polyphenols that are associated with health benefits, depending on the processing method. Polyphenol content varies widely among teas even before the decaffeinated process, so it is hard to know the exact amount that remains. Regardless of decaffeination type, tea is still considered a healthful beverage choice.
If you visit a tea shop, you may be surprised and overwhelmed by just how many different teas exist! Traditional teas originating from theCamellia sinensisplant include black, white, green, yellow, and oolong, all of which contain caffeine. Black tea is made by crushing and drying fresh tea leaves and allowing them to ferment, which oxidizes the leaves and changes their color and flavor. Oolong tea is partly fermented, and green tea undergoes no fermentation. Matcha is a special form of green tea in which the dried leaves are ground into a fine powder.
Decaffeinated teas have been processed to remove most of the naturally occurring caffeine from the leaves. They may still contain trace amounts of caffeine. This is done by using carbon dioxide, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, or water processing.
Herbal teas that are naturally caffeine-free include chamomile, peppermint, vanilla, turmeric, ginger, and fruit essence teas. They may have notes of floral, fruit, mint, spice, grassiness, sweetness, or bitterness. The varieties are vast, and the choice is completely up to your personal preferences.
Teas are packaged in tea bags, tea sachets, or as loose-leaf. Loose-leaf teas sold in tin canisters or sacks allow you to control how much tea to use, using more to create a stronger flavor or less for more mellowness. Tea bags and sachets hold a standard amount of leaves for optimum flavor and are portable.
There are five elements to avoid to keep tea as fresh as possible: light, heat, moisture, odor, and air. Tea bags should be stored in their original container or placed in a sealed plastic bin. Loose-leaf teas should be stored in an airtight container. Place all teas in a dark cupboard at a consistent room temperature. Tea tends to absorb odors from food and even other strongly scented teas, so keep them separate. Freezing and refrigerating is not recommended as the moisture introduced can degrade the tea.
If unopened, tea will last about one year beyond the ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date. After opening, packaged and loose-leaf teas last about one year. However, some black and oolong teas can last up to two years, and more delicate teas may last only 6 months. The flavor is your best guide to determining how long to keep a tea in your cupboard.
Avoid purchasing expensive bottled teas or teas from shops that contain added sweeteners. To enjoy the maximum benefits of drinking tea, consider brewing your own at home. You can serve it hot, or make a pitcher of home-brewed iced tea during warmer months.
Black and oolong teas are generally steeped in hot or boiling water (about 210¬∫ F) and brewed for about 4-5 minutes. Green tea is steeped at a slightly lower temperature 180¬∫ F from 4-15 minutes. The longer tea steeps, the stronger the flavor with bitter notes.
Additives of sugar, cream, or milk can reduce the polyphenol content of tea. For the greatest health benefits, try serving tea plain or without too many additives. A dash of vanilla or cinnamon can mimic sweetness. Some fruit-flavored herbal teas taste naturally sweet to the palate without added sweeteners.

üîó Processed Foods and Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/processed-foods/

Processed foods are generally thought to be inferior to unprocessed foods. The term may suggest that a packaged food item contains many ingredients, perhaps even artificial colors, flavors, or other chemical additives. Often referred to as convenience or pre-prepared foods, processed foods are suggested to contribute to the obesity epidemic and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. However, the definition of processed food varies widely depending on the source:
According to these standards, virtually all foods sold in the supermarket would be classified as ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù to some degree. Because food begins to deteriorate and loses nutrients as soon as it is harvested, even theapplesin the produce aisle undergo four or more processing steps before being sold to the consumer. That‚Äôs why in practice, it‚Äôs helpful to differentiate between the various degrees of food processing.
A popular system to classify processed foods was introduced in 2009, called the NOVA classification. It lists four categories considering the degree to which a food is processed and the purpose of these modifications: [2-4]
The NOVA system is recognized by the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization, but not currently in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration or USDA. NOVA has been criticized for being too general in classifying certain foods, causing confusion. For example, yogurt may fall into more than one category: plain yogurt is minimally processed, but fruited yogurt with added sweeteners could be labeled either processed or ultra-processed depending on how much sweetener and other chemical additives are incorporated. NOVA also does not provide comprehensive lists of specific foods in each category, so the consumer is left to guess where each may fall.
There‚Äôs no doubt that at least some processed foods are found in most people‚Äôs kitchens. There are benefits and drawbacks.
Depending on the degree of processing, nutrients can be destroyed or removed. Peeling outer layers of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may remove plant nutrients (phytochemicals) and fiber. Heating or drying foods can destroy certain vitamins and minerals. Although food manufacturers can add back some of the nutrients lost, it is impossible to recreate the food in its original form.
Currently, bread and frozen meals are some of the most consumed ultra-processed foods in the U.S. [5] While these products can be good sources of whole grains, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, they can also be high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats. Given the variety of ultra-processed foods, it may be helpful to distinguish those with lower nutritional value from the broader category. Such distinction can be determined by evaluating a food‚Äôs nutritional content and long-term health effects. A product with an unevenly high ratio of calories to fiber and healthy nutrients (e.g., unsaturated fats, B vitamins, potassium) may be considered an ‚Äúultra-processed food of low nutritional value.‚Äù For example, soda provides high calories from added sugars and no healthy nutrients; and research supports an association between a high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. On the other hand, whole-grain bread and fiber-containing low-sugar breakfast cereals that may be fortified with nutrients such as folic acid have consistently been linked with lower rates of stroke. [6]
To help illustrate the spectrum of food processing, the table below includes ultra-processed foods of low nutritional value as its own category.

Ingredients used widely in the production of ultra-processed foods such assaturated fats,added sugar, andsodiumhave become markers of poor diet quality due to their effect on heart disease, obesity, and high blood pressure. [8,9] It is estimated that ultra-processed foods contribute about 90% of the total calories obtained from added sugars. [5]
Food processing is a very broad spectrum that ranges from basic technologies like freezing or milling, to the incorporation of additives that promote shelf stability or increase palatability. As a general rule, emphasizing unprocessed or minimally processed foods in the daily diet is optimal. That said, the use of processed and even ultra-processed foods is the choice of the consumer, and there are pros and cons that come with each type. The Nutrition Facts Label and ingredients list can be useful tools in deciding when to include a more processed food in one‚Äôs diet. There is evidence showing an association with certain types of food processing and poor health outcomes, especially low-nutrient ultra-processed foods that containadded sugars,excess sodium, andunhealthful fats. But there also exist ultra-processed foods that have low amounts of these ingredients while being fortified in beneficial nutrients such as calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins B and D.
Research is still clarifying if any harmful health effects from ultra-processed foods arise from the higher degree of processing or simply from the poorer nutritional quality often accompanying these types of foods. There is a growing range of processed and ultra-processed foods available, and some products may be a useful addition to a healthful diet.
You don‚Äôt have to avoid all processed foods but begin by adding more fresh or minimally processed ingredients to your shopping cart. More time may be needed to prepare these foods than just opening a can or popping a frozen container in a microwave, but the rewards may be fresher flavors, increased nutrients, and eating less additives that have no nutritional benefit.

üîó Potassium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/potassium/

Potassium is an essential mineral that is needed by all tissues in the body. It is sometimes referred to as an electrolyte because it carries a small electrical charge that activates various cell and nerve functions. Potassium is found naturally in many foods and as a supplement. Its main role in the body is to help maintain normal levels of fluid inside our cells.Sodium, its counterpart, maintains normal fluid levels outside of cells. Potassium also helps muscles to contract and supports normal blood pressure.
The U.S. Dietary Reference Intakes state that there is not enough evidence to establish a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for potassium. However, the National Academy of Medicine has established an Adequate Intake (AI) for potassium. [1]
It is estimated that the average daily intake of potassium in adults is about 2,320 mg for women and 3,016 mg for men. [2]
The functions ofsodiumand potassium in the body are closely related and often studied together.
A study in theArchives of Internal Medicinefound that:
Assessing people‚Äôs sodium intakes can be tricky, and the most accurate method known is to measure 24-urine samples over several days.This is the method Harvard researchers usedwhen pooling data from 10,709 generally healthy adults from six prospective cohorts including the Nurses Health Studies I and II, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease study, and the Trials of Hypertension Prevention Follow-up studies. [17] They looked at both sodium and potassium intakes in relation tocardiovascular disease(CVD) risk (as noted by a heart attack, stroke, or procedure or surgery needed to repair heart damage), and measured two or more urine samples per participant. After controlling for CVD risk factors, they found that a higher sodium intake was associated with higher CVD risk. For every 1,000 mg increase of urinary sodium per day, there was an 18% increased risk of CVD. But for every 1,000 mg increase of potassium, there was an 18%lowerrisk of CVD. They also found that a higher sodium-to-potassium ratio was associated with higher CVD risk, that is, eating a higher proportion of salty foods to potassium-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy.
Calciumis one of the most important nutrients required for bone health. A condition called ‚Äúnegative calcium balance‚Äù occurs when calcium losses from the body are greater than the amount of calcium that is absorbed, which can lead to bone loss. This most often happens when a diet is too low in calcium orvitamin D, or in individuals with digestive problems that interfere with the absorption of the calcium. People with thyroid or kidney problems may lose too much calcium in their urine.
According to another theory called ‚Äúacid-base balance‚Äù or ‚Äúacid-alkaline theory‚Äù a high dietary acid load (such as that caused by a high meat and low fruit/vegetable intake) may lead to bone loss if calcium is pulled from bones to help neutralize the acid. It is believed that the breakdown of animal proteins and grains that are high in phosphorus and sulfates generates acid in the body. This causes the kidneys to flush out acid and calcium in the urine.
Potassium-rich foods might offer a buffering ‚Äúalkalinizing‚Äù effect because they contain compounds that can be metabolized to bicarbonate, which helps to neutralize acids in the body and may protect bone. Observational studies have found that a high potassium intake fromfruits and vegetablesis associated with higher bone density. [10] However, observational studies have not shown that a high protein intake negatively affects bone health or fracture risk; in fact, in the elderly a higherproteinintake appears to protect from fractures. So the acid-alkaline theory on bone health is not yet clear.
The high-potassiumDASH diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, has been found to lower markers of bone turnover. [10,11] However, there are other dietary factors of DASH (low sodium, adequate calcium) that may contribute to this result and not just potassium. Animal studies have shown that active plant chemicals and polyphenols in fruits and vegetables may also play a role in bone health.
Randomized controlled trials giving postmenopausal women potassium supplements or a placebo have not consistently found a benefit of less bone fractures or increased bone mineral density with higher potassium intake from supplements. [12,13]
The National Academy of Medicine report concluded that there may be certain components of potassium-rich foods such as its production of bicarbonate that may improve bone mineral density; however, these foods may contain other nutrients and plant chemicals beneficial to bone health that make it difficult to conclude that potassium alone has an effect on bone health. [1]
A diet rich in potassium helps to prevent calcium from being excreted in the urine, and may also help to prevent calcium from being released from bone into the blood. Calcium that is not reabsorbed is excreted in the urine, which may increase the risk of crystals forming that can lead to kidney stones.
A review of three large prospective cohort studies, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses‚Äô Health Studies I and II, found that a higher potassium intake was associated with a lower risk of stones in all three cohorts. The higher intake was associated specifically with a higher citrate concentration in urine and urine volume (from increased water obtained from fruits and vegetables), both protective factors against stones. [14]
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the American College of Physicians conducted a review of randomized controlled trials looking at medical management to prevent repeated kidney stones. [15] The review found that people with past kidney stones who increased their intake of potassium through potassium citrate supplements significantly lowered the risk of developing further stones, given that they also increased their fluid intake.
However, there is some truth that the metabolism of certain foods can create bicarbonates, which neutralizes acids in the body. [1] Potassium-rich foods that have an alkalizing effect includefruits,vegetables,almonds, andlentils. One theory suggests that a long-term high intake of protein foods such as meats, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs, as well as cereal grains may create a condition called low-grade metabolic acidosis due to their high sulfate and phosphate content. [10,16] This occurs particularly if the diet does not contain enough counterbalancing potassium-rich foods. The condition is sometimes referred to as the ‚Äò‚Äòacid-ash hypothesis,‚Äô‚Äô which may cause a very slight drop in blood pH, though still falling within a normal range. Theories suggest that even a small change such as this may increase one‚Äôs risk of developing conditions like kidney stones and bone loss.
BOTTOM LINE:Although theories in this area are compelling, the evidence is still inconsistent and it has not been shown in controlled trials that diet can significantly change blood pH in healthy people. Therefore it is too early to make specific recommendations based on this theory.
Potassium is widely available in many foods, especiallyfruits and vegetables. Leafy greens, beans,nuts, dairy foods, and starchy vegetables like winter squash are rich sources.
The kidneys work to maintain normal blood levels of potassium by flushing out excess amounts through urine. Potassium can also be lost through stool and sweat. At least 400-800 mg daily from food is needed because of normal daily losses. Any conditions that increase fluid losses beyond normal such as vomiting, diarrhea, and certain medications like diuretics can lead to a deficiency, calledhypokalemia. Hypokalemia is most common in hospitalized patients who are taking medications that cause the body to excrete too much potassium. It is also seen in people with inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn‚Äôs disease, ulcerative colitis) that may cause diarrhea and malabsorption of nutrients.
It is rare for a potassium deficiency to be caused by too low a food intake alone because it is found in so many foods; however an inadequate intake combined with heavy sweating, diuretic use, laxative abuse, or severe nausea and vomiting can quickly lead to hypokalemia. Another reason is a deficiency of magnesium, as the kidneys need magnesium to help reabsorb potassium and maintain normal levels in cells.
Too much potassium in the blood is calledhyperkalemia. In healthy people the kidneys will efficiently remove extra potassium, mainly through the urine. However, certain situations can lead to hyperkalemia: advanced kidney disease, taking medications that hold onto potassium in the body (including NSAIDs), or people who have compromised kidneys who eat a high-potassium diet (more than 4,700 mg daily) or use potassium-based salt substitutes. Symptoms of hyperkalemia:

üîó Coffee
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coffee/

Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren‚Äôt thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered ahealthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.
One 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Coffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee orcaffeinecan also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50‚Äì300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit?
Coffee may affect how cancer develops, ranging from the initiation of a cancer cell to its death. For example, coffee may stimulate the production of bile acids and speed digestion through the colon, which can lower the amount of carcinogens to which colon tissue is exposed. Various polyphenols in coffee have been shown to prevent cancer cell growth in animal studies. Coffee has also been associated with decreased estrogen levels, a hormone linked to several types of cancer. [5] Caffeine itself may interfere with the growth and spread of cancer cells. [6] Coffee also appears to lower inflammation, a risk factor for many cancers.
The 2018 uproar in California due towarning labels placed on coffee productsstemmed from a chemical in the beverage called acrylamide, which is formed when the beans are roasted. Acrylamide is also found in some starchy foods that are processed with high heat like French fries, cookies, crackers, and potato chips. It was classified in the National Toxicology Program‚Äôs¬†2014Report on Carcinogens, as ‚Äúreasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen‚Äù¬†based on studies in lab animals. However, there is not yet evidence of a health effect in humans from eating acrylamide in food. Regardless, in March 2018 a California judge ruled that all California coffee sellers must warn consumers about the ‚Äúpotential cancer risk‚Äù from drinking coffee, because coffee-selling companies failed to show that acrylamide didnotpose a significant health risk. California‚Äôs¬†law Proposition 65, or The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, fueled the ruling, which requires a warning label to be placed on any ingredient from a list of 900 confirmed or suspected carcinogens.
However, manycancer experts disputed the ruling, stating that the metabolism of acrylamide differs considerably in animals and humans, and the high amount of acrylamide used in animal research is not comparable to the amount present in food. They cited the beneficial health effects of coffee, with improved antioxidant responses and reduced inflammation, both factors important in cancer prevention. Evidence from the American Institute for Cancer Research concludes that drinking coffee mayreduce risk for endometrial and liver cancer, and based on a systematic review of a large body of research, it is not a risk¬†for the cancers that were studied.
In June 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed anew regulationexempting coffee from displaying cancer warnings under Proposition 65. This proposal was based on a review of more than 1,000 studies published by the World Health Organization‚Äôs International Agency for Research on Cancer that found inadequate evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer. In January 2019, OEHHA completed its review and response to comments and submitted the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for final review.
Although ingestion of caffeine can increase blood sugar in the short-term, long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developingtype 2 diabetescompared with non-drinkers. The polyphenols and minerals such as magnesium in coffee may improve the effectiveness of insulin and glucose metabolism in the body.
Caffeine is a stimulant affecting the central nervous system that can cause different reactions in people. In sensitive individuals, it can irritate the stomach, increase anxiety or a jittery feeling, and disrupt sleep. Although many people appreciate the temporary energy boost after drinking an extra cup of coffee, high amounts of caffeine can cause unwanted heart palpitations in some.
Unfiltered coffee, such as French press and Turkish coffees, contains diterpenes, substances that can raise bad LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Espresso coffee contains moderate amounts of diterpenes. Filtered coffee (drip-brewed coffee) and instant coffee contain almost no diterpenes as the filtering and processing of these coffee types removes the diterpenes.
Despite these factors, evidence suggests that drinking coffee regularly may lower the risk ofheart disease and stroke:
Naturally occurring polyphenols in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee can act as antioxidants to reduce damaging oxidative stress and inflammation of cells. It may have neurological benefits in some people and act as an antidepressant. [13] Caffeine may affect mental states such as increasing alertness and attention, reducing anxiety, and improving mood. [14] A moderate caffeine intake of less than 6 cups of coffee per day has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide. However in a few cases of sensitive individuals, higher amounts of caffeine may increase anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Suddenly stopping caffeine intake can cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, and low mood for a few days and may persist for up to a week. [15]
There are various proposed actions of caffeine or components in coffee that may prevent the formation of gallstones. The most common type of gallstone is made of cholesterol. Coffee may prevent cholesterol from forming into crystals in the gallbladder. It may stimulate contractions in the gallbladder and increase the flow of bile so that cholesterol does not collect. [24]
A study of 46,008 men tracked the development of gallstones and their coffee consumption for 10 years. After adjusting for other factors known to cause gallstones, the study concluded that men who consistently drank coffee were significantly less likely to develop gallstones compared to men who did not. [24] A similar large study found the same result in women. [25]
The bottom line:A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. [4] However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. [3, 27] Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there aremany other dietary strategiesto improve your health.Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee.It‚Äôs also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.
Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants calledCoffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.
A plain ‚Äúblack‚Äù cup of coffee is a very low calorie drink‚Äî8 ounces only contains 2 calories! However, adding sugar, cream, and milk can quickly bump up the calorie counts. A tablespoon of cream contains 52 calories, and a tablespoon of whole milk contains 9 calories. While 9 calories isn‚Äôt a lot, milk is often poured into coffee without measuring, so you may be getting several servings of milk or cream in your coffee. A tablespoon of sugar contains 48 calories, so if you take your coffee with cream and sugar, you‚Äôre adding over 100 extra calories to your daily cup.
However, the real caloric danger occurs in specialty mochas, lattes, or blended ice coffee drinks. These drinks are often super-sized and can contain anywhere from 200-500 calories, as well as an extremely large amount of sugar. With these drinks, it‚Äôs best to enjoy them as a treat or dessert, and stick with plain, minimally sweetened coffee on a regular basis

üîó Diet Review: Ketogenic Diet for Weight Loss
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/ketogenic-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The ketogenic or ‚Äúketo‚Äù diet is a low-carbohydrate, fat-rich eating plan that has been used for centuries to treat specific medical conditions. In the 19thcentury, the ketogenic diet was commonly used to help control diabetes. In 1920 it was introduced as an effective treatment for epilepsy in children in whom medication was ineffective. The ketogenic diet has also been tested and used in closely monitored settings for cancer, diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.
However, this diet is gaining considerable attention as a potential weight-loss strategy due to the low-carb diet craze, which started in the 1970s with the Atkins diet (a very low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, which was a commercial success and popularized low-carb diets to a new level). Today, other low-carb diets including the Paleo, South Beach, and Dukan diets are all high in protein but moderate in fat. In contrast, the ketogenic diet is distinctive for its exceptionally high-fat content, typically 70% to 80%, though with only a moderate intake of protein.
The premise of the ketogenic diet for weight loss is that if you deprive the body of glucose‚Äîthe main source of energy for all cells in the body, which is obtained by eating carbohydrate foods‚Äîan alternative fuel called ketones is produced from stored fat (thus, the term ‚Äúketo‚Äù-genic). The brain demands the most glucose in a steady supply, about 120 grams daily, because it cannot store glucose. During fasting, or when very little carbohydrate is eaten, the body first pulls stored glucose from the liver and temporarily breaks down muscle to release glucose. If this continues for 3-4 days and stored glucose is fully depleted, blood levels of a hormone called insulin decrease, and the body begins to use fat as its primary fuel. The liver produces ketone bodies from fat, which can be used in the absence of glucose. [1]
When ketone bodies accumulate in the blood, this is called ketosis. Healthy individuals naturally experience mild ketosis during periods of fasting (e.g., sleeping overnight) and very strenuous exercise. Proponents of the ketogenic diet state that if the diet is carefully followed, blood levels of ketones should not reach a harmful level (known as ‚Äúketoacidosis‚Äù) as the brain will use ketones for fuel, and healthy individuals will typically produce enough insulin to prevent excessive ketones from forming. [2] How soon ketosis happens and the number of ketone bodies that accumulate in the blood is variable from person to person and depends on factors such as body fat percentage and resting metabolic rate. [3]
There is not one ‚Äústandard‚Äù ketogenic diet with a specific ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates,protein,fat). The ketogenic diet typically reduces total carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams a day‚Äîless than the amount found in a medium plain bagel‚Äîand can be as low as 20 grams a day. Generally, popular ketogenic resources suggest an average of 70-80% fat from total daily calories, 5-10% carbohydrate, and 10-20% protein. For a 2000-calorie diet, this translates to about 165 grams fat, 40 grams carbohydrate, and 75 grams protein. The protein amount on the ketogenic diet is kept moderate in comparison with other low-carb high-protein diets, because eating too much protein can prevent ketosis. The amino acids in protein can be converted to glucose, so a ketogenic diet specifies enough protein to preserve lean body mass including muscle, but that will still cause ketosis.
Many versions of ketogenic diets exist, but all ban carb-rich foods. Some of these foods may be obvious: starches from both refined andwhole grainslike breads, cereals, pasta, rice, and cookies; potatoes, corn, and other starchy vegetables; and fruit juices. Some that may not be so obvious arebeans, legumes, and most fruits. Most ketogenic plans allow foods high in saturated fat, such asfatty cuts of meat, processed meats, lard, and butter, as well as sources ofunsaturated fats, such as nuts, seeds, avocados, plant oils, and oily fish. Depending on your source of information, ketogenic food lists may vary and even conflict.
Allowed
Not Allowed
*What Are Net Carbs?‚ÄúNet carbs‚Äù and ‚Äúimpact carbs‚Äù are familiar phrases in ketogenic diets as well as diabetic diets. They are unregulated interchangeable terms invented by food manufacturers as a marketing strategy, appearing on some food labels to claim that the product contains less ‚Äúusable‚Äù carbohydrate than is listed. [6] Net carbs or impact carbs are the amount of carbohydrate that are directly absorbed by the body and contribute calories. They are calculated by subtracting the amount of indigestible carbohydrates from the total carbohydrate amount. Indigestible (unabsorbed) carbohydrates include insoluble fibers from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; and sugar alcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol commonly used in sugar-free diabetic food products. However, these calculations are not an exact or reliable science because the effect of sugar alcohols on absorption and blood sugar can vary. Some sugar alcohols may still contribute calories and raise blood sugar. The total calorie level also does not change despite the amount of net carbs, which is an important factor with weight loss. There is debate even within the ketogenic diet community about the value of using net carbs.
Programs suggest following a ketogenic diet until the desired amount of weight is lost. When this is achieved, to prevent weight regain one may follow the diet for a few days a week or a few weeks each month, interchanged with other days allowing a higher carbohydrate intake.
The ketogenic diet has been shown to produce beneficial metabolic changes in the short-term. Along with weight loss, health parameters associated with carrying excess weight have improved, such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. [2,7] There is also growing interest in the use of low-carbohydrate diets, including the ketogenic diet, for type 2 diabetes. Several theories exist as to why the ketogenic diet promotes weight loss, though they have not been consistently shown in research: [2,8,9]
The findings below have been limited to research specific to the ketogenic diet: the studies listed contain about 70-80% fat, 10-20% protein, and 5-10% carbohydrate. Diets otherwise termed ‚Äúlow carbohydrate‚Äù may not include these specific ratios, allowing higher amounts of protein or carbohydrate. Therefore only diets that specified the terms ‚Äúketogenic‚Äù or ‚Äúketo,‚Äù or followed the macronutrient ratios listed above were included in this list below. In addition, though extensive research exists on the use of the ketogenic diet for other medical conditions, only studies that examined ketogenic diets specific to obesity or overweight were included in this list. (This paragraph was added to provide additional clarity on 5.7.18.)
Following a very high-fat diet may be challenging to maintain. Possible symptoms of extreme carbohydrate restriction that may last days to weeks include hunger, fatigue, low mood, irritability, constipation, headaches, and brain ‚Äúfog.‚Äù Though these uncomfortable feelings may subside, staying satisfied with the limited variety of foods available and being restricted from otherwise enjoyable foods like a crunchy apple or creamy sweet potato may present new challenges.
Some negative side effects of a long-term ketogenic diet have been suggested, including increased risk of kidney stones and osteoporosis, and increased blood levels of uric acid (a risk factor for gout). Possible nutrient deficiencies may arise if a variety of recommended foods on the ketogenic diet are not included. It is important to not solely focus on eating high-fat foods, but to include a daily variety of the allowed meats, fish, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds to ensure adequate intakes of fiber, B vitamins, and minerals (iron, magnesium, zinc)‚Äînutrients typically found in foods like whole grains that are restricted from the diet. Because whole food groups are excluded, assistance from a registered dietitian may be beneficial in creating a ketogenic diet that minimizes nutrient deficiencies.
Unanswered Questions
Available research on the ketogenic diet for weight loss is still limited. Most of the studies so far have had a small number of participants, were short-term (12 weeks or less), and did not include control groups. A ketogenic diet has been shown to provide short-term benefits in some people including weight loss and improvements in total cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. However, these effects after one year when compared with the effects of conventional weight loss diets are not significantly different. [10]
Eliminating several food groups and the potential for unpleasant symptoms may make compliance difficult. An emphasis on foods high insaturated fatalso counters recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association and may have adverse effects on blood LDL cholesterol. However, it is possible to modify the diet to emphasize foods low in saturated fat such as olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish.
A ketogenic diet may be an option for some people who have had difficulty losing weight with other methods.¬† The exact ratio of fat, carbohydrate, and protein that is needed to achieve health benefits will vary among individuals due to their genetic makeup and body composition. Therefore, if one chooses to start a ketogenic diet, it is recommended to consult with one‚Äôs physician and a dietitian to closely monitor any biochemical changes after starting the regimen, and to create a meal plan that is tailored to one‚Äôs existing health conditions and to prevent nutritional deficiencies or other health complications. A dietitian may also provide guidance on reintroducing carbohydrates once weight loss is achieved.
A modified carbohydrate diet following theHealthy Eating Plate modelmay produce adequate health benefits and weight reduction in the general population. [13]

üîó Diet Review: DASH
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/dash-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is sometimes prescribed by doctors to help treat high blood pressure. Blood pressure is the amount of pressure that blood places against the walls of arteries. It will normally vary throughout the day but if it remains too high, this is called high blood pressure or hypertension. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and blindness. [1]
DASH was first introduced at a meeting of the American Heart Association in 1996 and later published in theNew England Journal of Medicinein 1997. [2] The DASH trial randomly assigned 456 people to different diets to test the effects of dietary patterns on lowering blood pressure. The authors surmised that eating a diet with many different foods with blood pressure-lowering nutrients would show a greater effect on blood pressure than eating single nutrients, such as found in supplements or in a limited diet. Three diets were tested: 1) a control diet, or a standard American diet, 2) a fruits and vegetables diet, similar to the control diet but providing more fruits and vegetables and less snacks and sweets, and 3) a combination diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and low-fat dairy foods with reduced amounts of saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. The last two diets were richer in nutrients associated with lower blood pressure, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, fiber, and protein. All three diets provided about 3000 mg sodium, which is more than the recommended amount from theDietary Guidelines for Americansbut less than the average sodium intake for Americans. [3]
Despite no weight changes, the combination diet reduced blood pressure more than the other two diets. Those with hypertension showed greater decreases in blood pressure than those without hypertension. The reduction of blood pressure in the DASH combination diet was comparable to that of people on medication for stage 1 hypertension.
The results of this landmark study contributed much of the scientific basis for theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2010and later editions.
DASH is based on the following foods:fruits,vegetables, low fat milk,whole grains, fish, poultry,beans, andnuts. It recommends reducingsodium, foods andbeverages with added sugars, and red meat. The diet is heart-friendly as it limitssaturated and trans fat, while increasing the intake ofpotassium,magnesium, calcium,protein, andfiber, nutrients believed to help control blood pressure. [1]
The diet suggests a specific number of servings of the recommended foods listed above. The sample plans provided by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) are based on 1600, 2000, or 2600 calories daily. For 2000 calories a day, this translates to about 6-8 servings of grains or grain products (whole grains recommended), 4-5 servings vegetables, 4-5 fruits, 2-3 low fat dairy foods, 2 or fewer 3-ounce servings of meat, poultry, or fish, 2-3 servings of fats and oils, and 4-5 servings of nuts, seeds, or dry beans per week. It advises limiting sweets and added sugars to 5 servings or less per week. The plan defines the serving sizes of each these food groups.
Eating less carbohydrate but more protein or unsaturated fats may also benefit the heart. The OmniHeart (Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial to Prevent Heart Disease) clinical trial found that swapping out about 10% of calories from carbohydrates with protein (especially plant proteins like legumes, nuts, seeds) or monounsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, nuts, seeds) lowered blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides among adults with early or stage 1 hypertension. [4] Swapping carbohydrates specifically with unsaturated fats also helped to increase ‚Äúgood‚Äù HDL cholesterol. The benefit did not come from simply eating more fats and protein, but swapping an equal amount of calories so that the total calorie level stayed about the same. For 2000 calories a day, this translates to eating daily about 4-5 servings of whole grains, 5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 fruits, 2 low fat dairy foods, one 3-ounce serving of fish, poultry, or meat, and 2-3 servings of unsaturated fats, and eating weekly 7-8 servings of beans, nuts, or seeds.
To follow the plan, one must decide their calorie level and then divide the suggested servings of each food group throughout the day. This requires meal planning ahead of time. The NHLBI guide provides many tips on how to incorporate DASH foods and to lower sodium intake; aone-day sample menufollowing a 2300 mg sodium restriction and a 1500 mg sodium restriction; and one week‚Äôs worth of recipes. The NHLBI also publishes anonline databaseof ‚Äúheart healthy‚Äù recipes.
This sample meal plan is roughly 2000 calories, the recommended intake for an average person. If you have higher calorie needs, you may add an additional snack or two; if you have lower calorie needs, you may remove a snack. If you have more specific nutritional needs or would like assistance in creating additional meal plans, consult with a registered dietitian.
Breakfast:
Snack:¬º cup lightly salted or unsalted nuts
Lunch:
Snack:String cheese, medium apple
Dinner:
Snack:3 ¬Ω cups air-popped popcorn
Numerous studies show wide-ranging health benefits of the DASH diet. A consistent body of research has found that DASH lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure but also normal blood pressure even without lowering sodium intake. [5] It can produce greater reductions in blood pressure if sodium is restricted to less than 2300 mg a day, and even more so with a 1500 mg sodium restriction. [6, 7] When compared with a standard American diet (e.g., high intake of red and processed meats, beverages sweetened with sugar, sweets, refined grains) DASH has also been found to lower serum uric acid levels in people with hyperuricemia, which places them at risk for a painful inflammatory condition called gout. [8] Because people with gout often also have high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases, DASH is optimal in improving all of these conditions.
The DASH diet was found to lower cardiovascular risk in a controlled 8-week trial looking at participants randomized to consume either a DASH diet (low in total/saturated fat with whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts, fruits and vegetables), a fruit and vegetable-rich diet (more fruits/vegetables than control diet but same amount of fat), or control diet (standard American diet high in fat and cholesterol). [9]¬†The researchers estimated a 10-year reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease based on the participants‚Äô blood pressure and cholesterol levels before and after the diet intervention. Participants who ate the DASH or fruit/vegetable diets showed a 10% reduced risk compared with those eating the control diet, but women and Black adults showed the greatest benefits with a 13% and 14% risk reduction, respectively.
Adherence to the DASH-style pattern may also help prevent the development of diabetes, as analyzed in a recent meta-analysis, and kidney disease as found in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort that followed more than 3700 people who developed kidney disease. [10, 11] Dietary components of DASH that were protective in the ARIC cohort included a high intake of nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products. A high intake of red meat and processed meats increased kidney disease risk.
Research supports the use of the DASH diet as a healthy eating pattern that may help to lower blood pressure, and prevent or reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, and gout.

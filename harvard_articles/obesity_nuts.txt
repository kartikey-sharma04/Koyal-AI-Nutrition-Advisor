üîó Preventing Obesity
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity/preventing-obesity/

Let‚Äôs be clear: To make strides in reversing theobesity epidemic, changes must come from all parts of society‚Äîfrom governments and schools, businesses and non-profit organizations, neighborhoods and communities. Effective policies and programs are essential in ensuring that children and adults live, work, and play inenvironments that are conducive to healthy eatingand offeropportunities for physical activity.
Personal preferences and knowledge or beliefs can influence lifestyle choices, but there are so many complex factors that strongly impact individual behaviors. This page covers individual- and family-level strategies associated with maintaining a healthy weight, with the acknowledgement that we are too often fighting against a flood of accessible unhealthy options, persuasive advertising, and policies that make it far from easy.
Preventing weight gain over the years may not be possible for everyone, but there are strategies to help reduce the amount of weight change by increasing awareness of modifiable risk factors and working toward healthy lifestyle behaviors. Most of these strategies are covered in-depth throughout the website, so keep an eye out for links to more information below.
Nutritional quality matters when maintaining a healthy weight, and ahealthy eating patternis crucial to good health. Additionally,howwe eat matters too.

How we eat and how much:
Age, gender, body size, and level of physical activity dictate how much food you need each day to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. With extra-large restaurant portions, easy access to low-cost ultra-processed snacks and fast food, it‚Äôs far too easy to overeat. Try the tips below to avoid overeating.
After eating a meal, a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the small intestine. It sends messages to the brain indicating fullness. Normally, the hormone leaves the gut very quickly, so GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) medications are designed to mimic and prolong the action of GLP-1. This helps food to digest more slowly so you feel full sooner and longer, thus promoting reduced caloric intake and thus weight loss. GLP-1 RAs also lower blood sugar by triggering the release of insulin. Early research has also found these drugs to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack.
GLP-1 RAs are used to treat both diabetes and obesity, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved specific dosages and brand names for each condition. Ozempic (semaglutide), Victoza (liraglutide), and Mounjaro (tirzepatide) are prescribed for diabetes, and Wegovy (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide), and Zepbound (tirzepatide) are prescribed for obesity. Rates of weight loss have been substantial, with tirzepatide achieving up to 21% weight loss in 18 months, comparable to 25-30% weight loss achieved with gastric bypass surgery. [1] Unpleasant side effects of GLP-1 RAs are mostly gastrointestinal, with 58% of users in one study reporting stomach pain; other common complaints are constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most of reported GI side effects appear to be mild and moderate. [2] Pancreatitis and gastroparesis (severely decreased stomach emptying) are less common but appear in a small percentage of users. Clinical trials such as SURMOUNT-4 and STEP 1 have shown that discontinuation of the medications causes weight regain, although it should be noted that these trials are authored by scientists who have affiliations with pharmaceutical companies that produce these medications. [3,4]
Shortages of GLP-1 RAs have led to the creation of falsified versions that are sold through unregulated outlets. They are discouraged by the World Health Organization, as falsified medications may lack efficacy, cause toxic reactions, and may be produced in unhygienic conditions that lead to bacterial contamination. [5]
Regular physical activity is not only a key component of weight control, but it also offers a host of other health benefits such as reducing the risk of various chronic diseases and improving quality of life in those who have chronic illnesses and conditions. In children and adults, it is important to not just move more but to limit ‚Äúsit time‚Äù or being sedentary.SeeStaying Activefor further guidance on safe physical activity at all ages.
Watching television or other devices can be enjoyable and informative; unfortunately it is associated with increased sedentariness and less exercise, weight gain, increased exposure to marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages, and body image issues in youth due to unrealistic portrayals of body size and habits.
Chronically poor sleep (less than 7 hours a night) is associated with weight gain and obesity, increased abdominal fat, poorer diet quality, increased cravings, and difficulty in controlling weight. Poor sleep quality can also lead to fatigue and less desire to exercise.SeeSleepfor more guidance.
Today‚Äôs world is full of daily stresses. This is a normal part of life, but when these stresses become too much, they can take a toll on health and contribute to weight gain by leading to unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep quality, and other unhealthy activities.
Regular physical activity is one way to manage stress as well as control weight gain. Meditation, deep breathing exercises, nature walks or spending regular time outdoors, and finding other relaxing and enjoyable activities are important self-care strategies.SeeStress and Healthfor more information and tips.

üîó Nuts for the Heart
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/nuts-for-the-heart/

Many people think of nuts as just another junk food snack. In reality, nuts are excellent sources ofhealthy fat,protein, and other healthful nutrients.
One surprising finding from nutrition research is that people who regularly eat nuts are less likely to have heart attacks or die fromheart diseasethan those who rarely eat them. Several of the largest cohort studies, including the Adventist Study, the Iowa Women‚Äôs Health Study, the Nurses‚Äô Health Study, and the Physicians‚Äô Health Study have shown a consistent 30 percent to 50 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, or cardiovascular disease associated with eating nuts several times a week. In fact, the FDA now allows some nuts and foods made with them to carry this claim: ‚ÄúEating a diet that includes one ounce of nuts daily can reduce your risk of heart disease.‚Äù
There are several ways that nuts could have such an effect. The unsaturated fats they contain help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol. One group of unsaturated fat found in walnuts, the omega-3 fatty acids, appears to prevent the development of erratic heart rhythms.Omega-3 fatty acids(which are also found in fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish) may also prevent blood clots, much as aspirin does.

Coming up on Harvard Chan: This Week in Health‚Ä¶.Nuts and heart health.
{***Marta Guasch Soundbite***}
(We found that people who regularly eat nuts, including peanuts, walnuts, and tree nuts, have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease.)
In this week‚Äôs episode, a closer look at new research on the health benefits of nuts‚Äîincluding ways that you can include more in your diet.
{***Pause/Music***}
{***Amie***}
Hello and welcome to Harvard Chan: This Week in Health. It‚Äôs Thursday, December 7, 2017. I‚Äôm Amie Montemurro.
{***Noah***}
And I‚Äôm Noah Leavitt.
This week we‚Äôll be looking at two new studies out of the Harvard Chan School.
Later in the episode‚Äîwe‚Äôll tell you about research examining the effectiveness of strategies to increase physical activity on a large scale.
{***Amie***}
But first‚Äînuts and heart health.
In one of the largest studies to date about nuts, researchers found that eating several small servings of nuts each week may significantly lower your risk of heart attack or stroke.
{***Noah***}
Researchers analyzed data from more than 210,000 health professionals over as many as 32 years‚Äîand specifically looked at the effects of different kinds of nuts.
We spoke about the findings‚Äîincluding how many nuts you should be eating each week‚Äîwith one of the study‚Äôs authors, Marta Guasch, a research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.
{***Amie***}
And just a note before we dive into this interview‚Ä¶you will hear us talking a lot about peanuts‚Äîwhich are technically a legume. But researchers say peanuts are nutritionally similar to other nuts.
{***Noah***}
And I began our interview with Marta Guasch by asking her what differentiates this study from previous research on nuts.
{***Marta Guasch Interview***}
MARTA GUASCH: Previous evidence has shown that the frequent nut consumption is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and also cardiovascular risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome. But most of these previous prospective studies have focused on total nut consumption in relation to the risk of cardiovascular disease. So the effect of specific types of nuts, such as walnuts and peanuts and also peanut butter, with cardiovascular disease and specific types of cardiovascular disease, such as stroke or coronary heart disease, was unclear. So we thought that analyzing the effect of several types of nuts, including total nuts, peanuts, walnuts, and tree nuts, and the relation with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and myocardial infarction could be of particular interest.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so what were some of your key findings in that regard?
MARTA GUASCH: So, yeah, briefly, in the three large prospective cohort studies, with up to 32 years of follow-up, we found that people who regularly eat nuts, including peanuts, walnuts, and tree nuts, have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and also coronary heart disease, compared to people who never or almost never consume nuts. And we found a consistent inverse association with total nut consumption and total cardiovascular disease of 14% lower risk for those consuming five or more times per week of total nuts, and 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease. And also, we find the specific benefict for consuming walnuts one or more times per week, and also for peanuts and tree nuts, both for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease.
NOAH LEAVITT: So people who were eating more nuts had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.
MARTA GUASCH: Yes. Exactly.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so you just touched on there, you know, one or more times a week. So when we talk about regular nut consumption, what types of quantities of consumption are we talking about?
MARTA GUASCH: So in our study for total nuts, we observed the greatest benefits for those people who consume a handful of nuts, which is equivalent to 28 grams, or one ounce, five or more times per week had the lowest risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease compared to those who never consume nuts. But we also observed the beneficial effects on those consuming two or four times per week of nuts.
And actually, when we evaluated the nut consumption as a continuous variable, which means that we show the effects for 28 grams increase in nuts consumption instead of the categories, we observed that each 28-gram increase in nut consumption was associated with 6% lower risk. So for peanuts and tree nuts, which are like specific types of nuts, consuming them at least two times per week, we observed a benefit. So probably, I‚Äôd say that consuming four to seven servings per week of nuts, of any types of nuts, in a context of a healthy diet would be a good amount of nuts to consume.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so you‚Äôve got that kind of context of healthy diet, I‚Äôm sure people are sitting there thinking, OK, well, nuts are great, but they have a lot of calories or a lot of fat. So I guess could you put people at ease and say, you know, I guess kind of give some perspective in terms of including nuts as part of a healthy diet. You know, what is a healthy amount, and should we be concerned about weight gain or anything like that.
MARTA GUASCH: Yeah, that‚Äôs a good question. Despite nuts being an energy dense food and the belief that they can increase weight gain, there is no scientific evidence supporting the associations between weight gain and nut consumption. And indeed, there have been some results showing that nut consumption is associated with lower weight gain, or lower risk of obesity. And that‚Äôs probably because they can increase satiety and fullness. And this may potentially reduce the consumption of other unhealthy snacks.
NOAH LEAVITT: So kind of one of the additional benefits is that handful of nuts might make you a little more full, so maybe you‚Äôre less likely to go eat‚Äì chips are kind of a less healthy snack. So, you know, I‚Äôm in the supermarket, I see all the nuts in front of me‚Äì the almonds, the walnuts, the peanuts. I mean, are there any kind of nuts that you found were more beneficial than others?
MARTA GUASCH: Well actually, in our study, not really. We have observed benefits for total nuts, peanuts, tree nuts, and walnuts. They were all associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. And the intake of peanuts and walnuts was additionally associated with lower risk of stroke. However, what we observed was that peanut butter was not significantly associated with cardiovascular disease. This doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs harmful, it‚Äôs just that we didn‚Äôt observe an official association. So probably more studies on this line need to be done.
We believe that one of the reasons why we didn‚Äôt observe significant associations is because usually peanut butter is consumed with unhealthy foods, such as white bread or other processed foods with high amount of sugar. And this unhealthy pattern associated with the peanut butter consumption may have obscured some of the potential benefits of peanut butter.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so that‚Äôd kind of be a good piece of advice, too. I mean, people might see nuts, and they might see a trail mix filled with peanuts and candies. I mean, So it‚Äôs kind of important to‚Äì I guess maybe the important point is that, if you‚Äôre eating nuts, they should just be nuts on their own. I‚Äôm guessing unsalted nuts might be best.
MARTA GUASCH: Yeah, that‚Äôs really a good question. Actually, that‚Äôs one of probably our limitations of the study, because we were unable to differentiate between the type of nuts, so the preparation of nuts, just the total amount of nuts. But we believe that the consumption of raw or roasted nuts is beneficial for health, but if the nuts are covered in chocolate or have high amounts of sugar or high amounts of sodium, they are probably not as good.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so I know this was a really large study, I think 210,000 people. But as you just kind of hinted at, there are some limitations. So I guess what would be kind of further questions that you or other researchers would want to address with regards to nut consumption and cardiovascular disease?
MARTA GUASCH: So I think that one of the questions is understanding more of the mechanisms which explain these associations between nut consumption and cardiovascular disease, for example with novel techniques, such as metabolomics, genomics, or other techniques that can help us understand these underlying mechanisms. Also, another important thing could be to evaluate the differences among these preparation methods that we‚Äôve just talked about, like the different types of nuts, and maybe also to further elucidate the effects of peanut butter on health could be another line that could be interesting, too.
NOAH LEAVITT: And so you just kind of hinted at mechanisms there. So I mean, do we know a lot about why nuts might be beneficial, or is that still not exactly clear?
MARTA GUASCH: I think that one of the main reasons why we believe that nuts can be beneficial for health are because they are high in unsaturated fatty acids, also dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and other bioactive compounds. And there‚Äôs some evidence that has shown that nuts can improve blood lipids, they can attenuate inflammation, they can be also beneficial for endothelial function and decreased insulin resistance or glucose intolerance. So all these mechanisms can explain the lower risk on cardiovascular disease that we have observed because they are strong risk factors of cardiovascular disease.
NOAH LEAVITT: How do these findings fit into larger nutritional advice, especially with regards to I think there‚Äôs now this awareness that healthy fat consumption is a good thing, but also maybe reduced consumption of animal proteins can be positive. So how do your findings fit into this kind of larger nutritional context?
MARTA GUASCH: Yeah. So recently, dietary recommendations have shifted towards diets including higher quantities of plant-based foods over animal foods, with most dietary patterns also including nuts because their association with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors because of their unique nutritional composition. So nuts are a good source of healthy fats, including mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats, and they are also rich in plant-based protein, minerals and fiber. So they can really fit well into healthy diets that emphasize more plant-based foods, specifically because they can help and they can be a good source to substitute for animal foods, such as red meat or other processed meats.
NOAH LEAVITT: Is there any general advice for people looking to get more nuts into their diet, or is it as simple as just maybe keep a jar at work and just take a handful, you know, every day for a snack?
MARTA GUASCH: I think that several things can be done to increase the consumption of nuts. One may be just to use it as a snack, as a healthy snack in, like, the morning or the afternoon. Just a handful of nuts would be a healthy snack compared to eating other things. But they can be also included, like, in salads or with yogurt or with fruit as a way to increase the consumption.
{***Noah***}
That was our interview with Marta Guasch about nuts and heart health.
{***Amie***}
If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about her research‚Äîand the larger health benefits of nuts, we‚Äôll have some information on our website, hsph.me/thisweekinhealth.
{***Noah***}
And now we shift gears from healthy eating‚Äîto another beneficial habit‚Äîphysical activity.
{***Amie***}
The health benefits of exercise are well-known, but getting people to actually be active is much more of a challenge.
{***Masamitsu Kamada Soundbite***}
(Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle remains highly prevalent globally. So, effective population strategies to promote physical activity are necessary to reduce the global burden of noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, stemming from physical inactivity.
{***Amie***}
That‚Äôs Masamitsu Kamada, a research fellow in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences here at the Harvard Chan School.
{***Noah***}
Kamada and colleagues recently tested one strategy to promote physical activity on a large scale.
And their study was unique for a couple of reasons.
{***Amie***}
Kamada told us that most studies on physical activity interventions are not high-quality enough or long enough to effectively measure what works.
{***Noah***}
That might mean that the population being study isn‚Äôt large enough‚Äîor researchers weren‚Äôt able to follow participants long enough to measure the benefit of an intervention.
{***Amie***}
In this case Kamada and his colleagues conducted a five-year randomized trial of a community-wide intervention in Unnan City, Japan.
It‚Äôs a city of about 44,000 people‚Äîand more than 4,400 people were involved in the study.
{***Noah***}
They were testing a program that aimed to improve physical activity through social marketing‚Äîso informing and educating people about the benefits of physical activity through posters, news reports, and even the use of high-profile influencers.
{***Amie***}
The campaign focused on three types of activities: aerobic, flexibility, and muscle-strengthening.
Questionnaires were then sent to the participants one year, three years, and five years after the study began to measure their level of physical activity.
{***Noah***}
Overall researchers say this intervention was successful at promoting all three types of physical activity.
But the style of messaging was important‚Äîthe campaign was most successful when it focused on a specific type of activity‚Äîas opposed to generally promoting all three.
{***Masamitsu Kamada Soundbite***}
(The intervention was effective for promoting all types of recommended physical activities. That is, aerobic, flexibility, and the muscle strengthening activities. But interestingly, a bundled approach‚Äì or in other words, an all-in-one approach‚Äì was not effective. This means we failed when we attempted to promote all types of physical activities simultaneously. So maybe the key message is one thing at one time. Dissemination of knowledge doesn‚Äôt assure dissemination of behavior. So we need more sophisticated strategies and approaches to change actual behavior or, in this case, physical activity.)
{***Noah***}
Researchers say another key takeaway is that one year was not enough to see an effect‚Äîwhich means that communities do need to invest in long-term interventions.
{***Amie***}
Kamada says that the intervention also does not address the other factors that can affect a person‚Äôs ability to be active‚Äîsuch as the built environment or social and psychological factors.
{***Noah***}
Kamada says more research is needed to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to address these factors.
{***Amie***}
That‚Äôs all for this week‚Äôs episode‚Äîa reminder that if you‚Äôd like to learn more about either of the studies we discussed in this episode, you can visit hsph.me/thisweekinhealth.
{***Noah***}
A reminder that you can always find older episodes of our podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, and Soundcloud.
Nuts are rich in arginine, an amino acid needed to make a molecule called nitric oxide that relaxes constricted blood vessels and eases blood flow. They also contain vitamin E,folate, potassium, fiber, and other healthful nutrients. Because different nuts supply a different mix of nutrients, it‚Äôs a good idea to incorporate a variety of nuts into ahealthy eating plan.
Of course, eating nuts won‚Äôt do much good if you gobble them in addition to usual snacks and meals. At an average of 185 calories per ounce, a handful of walnuts a day could add 10 pounds or more in a year if you don‚Äôt cut back on something else. This weight gain would tip the scales toward heart disease, not away from it. Instead, eat nuts instead of chips or other, less healthy snacks. Or try using them instead of meat inmain dishes, or as a healthful crunch in salads.

üîó Electrolyte Drinks
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/electrolyte-drinks/

Move over plain water? Commercial beverages in the U.S. aside from alcohol are a multi-billion-dollar industry and growing rapidly. Fueled by strong consumer interest in fitness and wellness, electrolyte orsports drinkscomprise a large share of the beverage market. They were originally created to prevent dehydration and electrolyte loss in young athletes who sweat and trained for hours in hot weather, which could hinder performance. Electrolyte beverages are designed to be easily absorbed in the gut to quickly rebalance mineral and fluid levels.
Eventually, marketing of the drinks shifted to a much larger audience: the non-athlete fitness enthusiast, which included anyone who donned a pair of sneakers for a weekly workout. Labeled ‚Äúhydration drinks,‚Äù they claim to hydrate even better than water. Others advertise a boost in energy and fitness performance thanks to added B vitamins and caffeine. Some containlow-calorie sweetenersto enhance flavor. They‚Äôre sold in ready-to-drink bottles or as supplements in tablet and powdered form that are added to plain water.
Electrolytes are minerals that have an electrical charge when dissolved in water. Electrical charges are needed to contract muscles, regulate heart rhythms, and maintain healthy fluid levels inside and outside of cells. Electrolyte minerals includesodium,potassium,magnesium,phosphorus,calcium, andchloride.
Because electrolytes are so vital to the body‚Äôs automatic functions, their blood levels are tightly regulated, meaning that your blood level does not always reflect how much you are eating (or not eating) of that mineral. Healthy kidneys can excrete excess amounts of electrolytes through urine if blood levels are too high (such as after eating a salt-loaded Italian sub) as well as hold onto body water if electrolyte levels are too low.
A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and lean protein foods naturally provides adequate amounts of electrolytes that our bodies need. But not everyone eats a consistently balanced diet, and certain medical conditions, drugs, and situations can cause dehydration and a deficiency in these minerals
Some beverages naturally contain electrolytes. Examples include:
Essentially any beverage containing electrolyte minerals may be labeled an electrolyte drink. Commercial electrolyte-branded waters and tablets contain varying ratios of electrolyte minerals. Some are very costly while offering only a small amount of these nutrients, while others may contain a high amount of only one nutrient such as potassium or sodium.
When an exercise workout is less than one hour and of lower intensity performed in moderate temperatures,plain wateris the best choice. Eating a balanced meal or a snack such as a banana with peanut butter,yogurtand pretzels, or chocolate milk shortly after a workout can naturally and safely replete electrolytes.
To save money and better control the ingredients, a homemade electrolyte drink is easy to make. The ratio of ingredients ‚Äì including electrolyte minerals, water, and a small amount of glucose in the form of sugar or honey ‚Äì enhances the absorption of fluid and electrolytes into the intestines.
Basic Electrolyte Water Recipe (makes about 1 liter):
Conditions that cause the body to lose large amounts of fluid in a short time increase the risk of nutrient depletion, as minerals are carried away with the fluid. Examples areexcessive diarrhea, vomiting, or sweatingthat can occur from viral infections, food-borne illnesses, gastrointestinal disorders, and strenuous physical activity usually longer than 1-2 hours such as withtrained athletes. Excessive alcohol intake can also cause the kidneys to excrete too much fluid from the body, carrying minerals with it.
Some medical conditions or medications reduce the absorption of minerals in the body, or require an increased intake of minerals. These include:
Electrolyte beverages andsports drinksare popular alternatives towaterbecause they add flavor and are touted to hydrate better than water. They are also heavily marketed through the billion-dollar beverage industry. Although electrolyte drinks may be useful for performance athletes who are regularly training or for those who have underlying medical conditions that place them at risk for electrolyte depletion, there is no evidence that these are healthier choices than water for the average person. Some commercial electrolyte beverages are costly, and contain extra calories from added sweeteners and high amounts of minerals like sodium that may have adverse effects in some people. Electrolytes can naturally be obtained from abalanced healthy diet.

üîó Oral Health
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/oral-health/

‚ÄúThere is no health without oral health.‚Äù You may have heard this statement but what does it mean? The health of our mouth, or oral health, is more important than many of us may realize. It is a key indicator of overall health, which is essential to our well-being and quality of life.
Although preventable to a great extent, untreated tooth decay (or cavities) is the most common health condition worldwide. When we think about the potential consequences of untreated oral diseases including pain, reduced quality of life, lost school days, disruption to family life, and decreased work productivity, making sure our mouths stay healthy is incredibly important. [1]
The mouth, also called the oral cavity, starts at the lips and ends at the throat. A healthy mouth and well-functioning teeth are important at all stages of life since they support human functions like breathing, speaking, and eating. In a healthy mouth, tissues are moist, odor-free, and pain-free. When we talk about a healthy mouth, we are not just talking about the teeth but also the gingival tissue (or gums) and the supporting bone, known together as the periodontium. The gingiva may vary in color from coral pink to heavily pigmented and vary in pattern and color between different people. Healthy gingiva is firm, not red or swollen, and does not bleed when brushed or flossed. A healthy mouth has no untreated tooth decay and no evidence of lumps, ulcers, or unusual color on or under the tongue, cheeks, or gums. Teeth should not be wiggly but firmly attached to the gingiva and bone. It should not hurt to chew or brush your teeth.
Throughout life, teeth and oral tissues are exposed to many environmental factors that may lead to disease and/or tooth loss. The most common oral diseases are tooth decay and periodontal disease. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to avoid these two diseases.
Just like a healthy body, a healthy smile depends on good nutrition. Abalanced dietwith adequate nutrients is essential for a healthy mouth and in turn, a healthy mouth supports nutritional well-being. Food choices and eating habits are important in preventing tooth decay and gingival disease.
Minerals likecalciumandphosphoruscontribute to dental health by protecting and rebuilding tooth enamel. [2] Enamel is the hard outer protective layer of the tooth (fun fact: enamel is the hardest substance in the human body). Eating foods high in calcium and other nutrients such ascheese,milk,plain yogurt,calcium-fortified tofu,leafy greens, andalmondsmay help tooth health. [2] Whileprotein-rich foodslike meat, poultry, fish, milk and eggs are great sources of phosphorus.
When it comes to a healthy smile,fruits and vegetablesare also good choices since they are high in water andfiber, which balance the sugars they hold and help to clean the teeth. [2] These foods also help stimulate saliva, which helps to wash away acids and food from teeth, both neutralizing acid and protecting teeth from decay. Many fruits and vegetables also have vitamins likevitamin C, which is important for healthy gingiva and healing, andvitamin A,another key nutrient in building tooth enamel.[2]
Wateris the clear winner as the best drink for your teeth‚Äîparticularly fluoridated water. It helps keep your mouth clean and helps fight dry mouth.Fluorideis needed regularly throughout life to protect teeth against tooth decay. [3] Drinking water with fluoride is one of the easiest and most beneficial things you can do to help prevent cavities.
Nutrition and oral health are closely related. The World Health Organization defines malnutrition as deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person‚Äôs intake of energy and/or nutrients. This means that malnutrition can be over-nutrition or undernutrition. Dental pain or missing teeth can lead to difficulty chewing or swallowing food which negatively affects nutrition. This may mean eating fewer meals or meals with lower nutritional value due to impaired oral health and increased risk of malnutrition. On the other hand, lack of proper nutrients can also negatively affect the development of the oral cavity, the progression of oral diseases and result in poor healing. [5] In this way, nutrition affects oral health, and oral health affects nutrition.
Nutrition is a major factor in infection and inflammation. [5] Inflammation is part of the body‚Äôs process of fighting against things that harm it, like infections and injuries. Although inflammation is a natural part of the body‚Äôs immune response to protect and heal the body, it can be harmful if it becomes unbalanced. In this way inflammation is a dominant factor in many chronic diseases. Periodontal diseases and obesity are risk factors involved in the onset and progression of chronic inflammation and its consequences. [6]
While it may appear that oral diseases only affect the mouth, their consequences can affect the rest of the body as well. There is a proven relationship between oral and general health. Many health conditions may increase the risk of oral diseases, and poor oral health can negatively affect many general health conditions and the management of those conditions. Most oral diseases share common risk factors with chronic diseases likecardiovascular disease,cancers,diabetes, and respiratory diseases. These risk factors include unhealthy diets, particularly those high in added sugar, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. [7]
Infective endocarditis (IE), an infection of the inner lining of the heart muscle, can be caused by bacteria that live on teeth. [8] Gingivitis and periodontitis are inflammatory diseases of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth caused by specific bacteria. There is evidence that the surface of inflamed tissue around teeth is the point of entry for the specific bacteria that cause as much as 50% of the IE cases in the U.S. annually. This means that improving oral hygiene may help in reducing the risk of developing IE. In addition, periodontal disease may be associated withheart diseaseand shares risk factors including tobacco use, poorly controlleddiabetes, andstress. [9,10]
Oral health is an important part of prenatal care. Poor oral health during pregnancy can result in poor health outcomes for both mother and baby. For example, studies suggest that pregnant women who have periodontal disease may be more likely to have a baby that is born too early and too small. [7] Hormonal changes during pregnancy, particularly elevated levels of progesterone, increase susceptibility to periodontal disease, which includes gingivitis and periodontitis. For this reason, your dentist may recommend more frequent professional cleanings during your pregnancy.
If you are struggling with morning sickness, the stomach acid from vomiting can erode or wear away tooth enamel. To help prevent the effects of erosion, rinse your mouth with 1 teaspoon of baking soda mixed in a cup of water, then wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth. [11]
Certain conditions may also affect your oral health, including:
Depending on the type of orthodontic treatment, your braces may have brackets, bands, and wires. In this case, it is important to avoid eating hard or sticky food. This includes things like nuts, popcorn, hard candy or gum, which could break or displace parts of your orthodontics and potentially delay your treatment. Enjoying pasta, soft veggies, fruits, and dairy products are good choices. Having good oral hygiene is key in making sure tooth decay do not form around the braces. This means making sure the teeth and braces are thoroughly cleaned of food debris so that plaque does not accumulate. Allowing plaque to build-up can cause white spots on the surfaces of the teeth. You can ask your dentist for tips on how to maintain good oral hygiene.
If you have clear trays or aligners that are removable, you should always remove your trays before eating or drinking any liquid other than water. Regardless of whether food is hard or soft, removing your tray before eating helps to ensure effectiveness of your treatment.
If you wear dentures, adjusting to what and how you eat can be a major challenge. When you first get dentures, your mouth and tissue need time to adjust to chewing and biting. Starting with soft foods like soups, smoothies, and applesauce for your first few meals can help make the transition more comfortable. Be mindful of hot dishes and drinks as it can sometimes be difficult to gauge the temperature of your food. After a couple of days, you can move onto more solid foods as your mouth begins to adjust to the dentures. Take care to avoid hard or sticky food and tough meats which could break or damage your dentures. Denture-friendly foods include slow-cooked or ground meats, cooked fish, ripe fruits, and cooked vegetables. A good tip is that if you can cut the food with a fork, chances are the food will not damage your dentures.
Dry mouth or xerostomia can make it difficult to talk, chew, and swallow food. Symptoms of dry mouth may include increased thirst, sore mouth and tongue, difficulty swallowing and talking, and changes in taste. [14] If you are experiencing a dry mouth, it is important to talk to your oral health care provider (as well as primary care provider) to better understand the potential causes and management. Regardless of the cause, you have lots of options for making it easier to eat. First, ensure that you drink plenty of fluids and sip cold water between meals. Chew your food well if you‚Äôre having trouble swallowing and only take small bites. Combining solid foods with liquid foods such as yogurt, gravy, sauces, or milk can also help. You want to avoid foods that are acidic, hot, or spicy as these may irritate your mouth further. Good oral care also plays a key role in alleviating dry mouth and preventing tooth decay, which is a common oral complication of dry mouth.
Here are some actions you can take to support good oral health: [15]
As growing research and studies reveal the link between oral health and overall health, it becomes more evident that taking care of your teeth isn‚Äôt just about having a nice smile and pleasant breath. Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more, while positive oral health can enhance both mental and overall health. Good oral hygiene and regular visits to the dentist, combined with a healthy lifestyle and avoiding risks like excess sugar and smoking, help to keep your smile and body healthy.

üîó Diet Review: MIND Diet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/mind-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet, targets the health of the aging brain. Dementia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, driving many people to search for ways to prevent cognitive decline. In 2015, Dr. Martha Clare Morris and colleagues at Rush University Medical Center and the Harvard Chan School of Public Health published two papers introducing the MIND diet. [1,2] Both theMediterraneanandDASHdiets had already been associated with preservation of cognitive function, presumably through their protective effects against cardiovascular disease, which in turn preserved brain health.
The research team followed a group of older adults for up to 10 years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), a study of residents free of dementia at the time of enrollment. They were recruited from more than 40 retirement communities and senior public housing units in the Chicago area. More than 1,000 participants filled out annual dietary questionnaires for nine years and had two cognitive assessments. A MIND diet score was developed to identify foods and nutrients, along with daily serving sizes, related to protection against dementia and cognitive decline. The results of the study produced fifteen dietary components that were classified as either ‚Äúbrain healthy‚Äù or as unhealthy. Participants with the highest MIND diet scores had a significantly slower rate of cognitive decline compared with those with the lowest scores. [1] The effects of the MIND diet on cognition showed greater effects than either the Mediterranean or the DASH diet alone.
The purpose of the research was to see if the MIND diet, partially based on theMediterraneanandDASHdiets, could directly prevent the onset or slow the progression of dementia. All three diets highlight plant-based foods and limit the intake of animal and high saturated fat foods. The MIND diet recommends specific ‚Äúbrain healthy‚Äù foods to include, and five unhealthy food items to limit. [1]
The healthy items the MIND diet guidelines* suggest include:
The unhealthy items, which arehigher in saturated and trans fat, include:
*Note: modest variations in amounts of these foods have been used in subsequent studies. [9,10]
This sample meal plan is roughly 2000 calories, the recommended intake for an average person. If you have higher calorie needs, you may add an additional snack or two; if you have lower calorie needs, you may remove a snack. If you have more specific nutritional needs or would like assistance in creating additional meal plans, consult with a registered dietitian.
Breakfast:1 cup cooked steel-cut oats mixed with 2 tablespoons slivered almonds, ¬æ cup fresh or frozen blueberries, sprinkle of cinnamon
Snack:1 medium orange
Lunch:
Snack:¬º cup unsalted mixed nuts
Dinner:
Wine was included as one of the 15 original dietary components in the MIND diet score, in which a moderate amount was found to be associated with cognitive health. [1] However, in subsequent MIND trials it was omitted for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù reasons. The effect of alcohol on an individual is complex, so that blanket recommendations about alcohol are not possible. Based on one‚Äôs unique personal and family history, alcohol offers each person a different spectrum of benefits and risks. Whether or not to include alcohol is a personal decision that should be discussed with your healthcare provider. For more information, readAlcohol: Balancing Risks and Benefits.
The MIND diet contains foods rich in certain vitamins, carotenoids, and flavonoids that are believed to protect the brain by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Although the aim of the MIND diet is on brain health, it may also benefit heart health, diabetes, and certain cancers because it includes components of theMediterraneanandDASHdiets, which have been shown to lower the risk of these diseases.
Cohort studies
Researchers found a 53% lower rate of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease for those with the highest MIND diet scores (indicating a higher intake of foods on the MIND diet). Even those participants who had moderate MIND diet scores showed a 35% lower rate compared with those with the lowest MIND scores. [2] The results didn‚Äôt change after adjusting for factors associated with dementia including healthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular-related conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes), depression, and obesity, supporting the conclusion that the MIND diet was associated with the preservation of cognitive function.
Several other large cohort studies have shown that participants with higher MIND diet scores, compared with those with the lowest scores, had better cognitive functioning, larger total brain volume, higher memory scores, lower risk of dementia, and slower cognitive decline, even when including participants with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and history of stroke. [3-8]
Clinical trials
A 2023 randomized controlled trial followed 604 adults aged 65 and older who at baseline were overweight (BMI greater than 25), ate a suboptimal diet, and did not have cognitive impairment but had a first-degree relative with dementia. [9] The intervention group was taught to follow a MIND diet, and the control group continued to consume their usual diet. Both groups were guided throughout the study by registered dietitians to follow their assigned diet and reduce their intake by 250 calories a day. The authors found that participants in both the MIND and control groups showed improved cognitive performance. Both groups also lost about 11 pounds, but the MIND diet group showed greater improvements in diet quality score. The authors examined changes in the brain using magnetic resonance imaging, but findings did not differ between groups. [10] Nutrition experts commenting on this study noted that both groups lost a similar amount of weight, as intended, but the control group likely improved their diet quality as well (they had been coached to eat their usual foods but were taught goal setting, calorie tracking, and mindful eating techniques), which could have prevented significant changes from being seen between groups. Furthermore, the duration of the study‚Äì3 years‚Äìmay have been too short to show significant improvement in cognitive function.
The results of this study showed that the MIND diet does not slow cognitive aging over a 3-year treatment period. Whether the MIND diet or other diets can slow cognitive aging over longer time periods remains a topic of intense interest.
Other factors
Research has found that greater poverty and less education are strongly associated with lower MIND diet scores and lower cognitive function. [11]
The MIND diet can be a healthful eating plan that incorporates dietary patterns from theMediterraneanandDASH, both of which have suggested benefits in preventing and improvingcardiovascular diseaseanddiabetes, and supporting healthy aging. When used in conjunction with abalanced plate guide, the diet may also promote healthy weight loss if desired. Whether or not following the MIND diet can slow cognitive aging over longer time periods remains an area of interest, and more research needs to be done to extend the MIND studies in other populations.

üîó Phosphorus
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/phosphorus/

Phosphorus is a mineral that naturally occurs in many foods and is also available as a supplement. It plays multiple roles in the body. It is a key element of bones, teeth, and cell membranes. It helps to activate enzymes, and keeps blood pH within a normal range. Phosphorus regulates the normal function of nerves and muscles, including the heart, and is also a building block of our genes, as it makes up DNA, RNA, and ATP, the body‚Äôs major source of energy. [1]
The kidneys, bones, and intestines tightly regulate phosphorus levels in the body. If the diet lacks phosphorus or too little phosphorus is absorbed, several things happen to preserve its stores and try to maintain normal levels: the kidneys excrete less phosphorus in urine, the digestive tract becomes more efficient at absorbing phosphorus, and the bones release its stores of phosphorus into the blood. [1] The opposite actions occur in these organs if the body has adequate phosphorus stores.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adult men and women 19+ years is 700 mg a day. Pregnancy and lactation require the same amount of phosphorus at 700 mg daily. [2]
UL:The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for phosphorus for adult men and women ages 19-70 years old is 4,000 mg daily, and for older adults 71+ years, 3,000 mg daily. The UL for pregnant and lactating women ages 14-50 years is 3,500 and 4,000 mg, respectively.
Kidneys help to regulate normal levels of phosphorus in the body. If the body has adequate stores of the mineral, the kidneys will push out extra phosphorus in the urine. With chronic kidney disease (CKD), the kidneys cannot perform this action and the amount of phosphorus can rise to harmful levels in the blood. Studies show that adults with CKD have higher phosphate levels than those with normal kidney function. [3] This may quicken the progression of CKD, and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, bone disorders, and death. [4,5] It appears that patients with higher phosphate levels and more advanced levels of CKD (such as those on dialysis) have a greater risk of disease progression and death than those with milder forms of CKD. [6-9]
Even so, it is unclear if lowering phosphate levels in those with CKD improves health outcomes later on. Dietary recommendations for phosphorus depend on how much the disease has progressed, and a person‚Äôs blood level of phosphorus. Some recommendations suggest limiting animal protein while increasing plant proteins, and reading food labels to limit foods with phosphate additives. [4] Plant-based proteins like legumes, nuts, and seeds containphytates, which interfere with the absorption of phosphorus in the gut. [10] Medications like phosphate binders are also sometimes prescribed to be taken with food to reduce the amount of phosphorus absorbed in the gut.
Some studies have found that excess phosphorus can promote the calcification, or hardening, of heart arteries and increase inflammation. [11] Higher phosphate levels may be associated with an increased risk ofcardiovascular disease(CVD). A meta-analysis of six cohort studies of more than 120,000 healthy adults followed for up to 29 years showed a 36% increased risk of deaths from CVD and all causes in those with the highest levels of serum phosphorus, compared with the lowest levels. [12] Deaths from all causes were seen mainly in men, not women.
The foods highest in phosphorus are animal proteins, which also tend to be high in other components related to CVD, like saturated fat. So it is not clear if phosphorus alone is associated with an increased risk of CVD, or if high levels are an indicator of another risk factor. The research is also unclear if restricting dietary phosphorus can prevent CVD in otherwise healthy adults. [2]
Elevated phosphorus levels may disrupt the normal hormonal balance of phosphorus,calcium, andvitamin Dthat regulates bone health. Animal studies have shown that high dietary phosphorus intakes are detrimental to bone health. Yet the evidence is less clear in humans, partly because it is difficult to estimate accurate phosphorus intakes. Most studies measure phosphorus in the blood, which may not reflect true dietary intakes of phosphorus, since the majority of the mineral is stored in bones and the body maintains blood levels within a specific range. However, research has shown that a higher intake of phosphate additives, from various foods like cola beverages and salad dressings that are very well-absorbed in the gut, are associated with negative effects on bone metabolism. [13] These include fractures and a lower bone mineral density. [14] More research is needed in this area.
A variety of foods naturally contain phosphorus, and the richest sources are dairy, red meat, poultry, seafood, legumes, and nuts. Phosphorus from these foods is called organic phosphorus. It is absorbed more efficiently from animal foods than plant foods. Plant foods like seeds, legumes, and whole grains contain a storage form of phosphorus calledphytates or phytic acidthat can reduce the mineral‚Äôs absorption. The body lacks an enzyme needed to break down phytic acid, so as it passes through the digestive tract it can bind not only to phosphorus but other minerals likeironandzinc. Cooking, sprouting, and soaking are some food preparation techniques that help to break down phytic acid so that phosphorus is more easily absorbed.
Inorganic phosphorus is a processed form added to foods to preserve color, moisture, and texture. It is found in fast foods, deli meats, canned and bottled beverages, and many other processed foods. Phosphate additives and preservatives are a significant contributor to phosphorus intakes, comprising up to 30% in the U.S. diet. [4] Inorganic phosphorus is very easily absorbed in the gut: about 90%, compared with 40-60% from natural animal and plant foods. [15] Phosphorus is also available in supplement form.
A phosphorus deficiency is called hypophosphatemia, defined by blood levels that fall below the normal range. However, blood levels of phosphate do not necessarily show the total amount of phosphorus in the body, as most of it is stored in bones and teeth. The most common causes of deficiency are kidney problems or a condition called hyperparathyroidism, in which too much parathyroid hormone is released that causes phosphorus to exit the body through urine. Also, the overuse of aluminum-containing antacids can bind to phosphorus and increase the risk of a deficiency.
A notable but less common occurrence of hypophosphatemia occurs with refeeding syndrome, seen in people with severe malnutrition. Patients who are malnourished from conditions like cancer, advanced liver disease, alcohol abuse, or anorexia nervosa may be started on supplemental nutrition feedings through a tube or vein. However because their starved state has reduced their ability to efficiently process food, reintroducing nutrition can cause problems. A sudden infusion of nutrients and calories causes an insulin surge, which results in rapid shifts in electrolytes and fluids in the blood. Blood levels of electrolyte nutrients like potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium may quickly drop. If untreated, refeeding syndrome can lead to respiratory failure, coma, cardiac arrest, and even death. The situation can be avoided by giving these electrolytes intravenously to the patient prior to the nutritional feedings.
Symptoms appearing with a phosphorus deficiency:
A toxicity from phosphorus, called hyperphosphatemia, is rare because the body will regulate any excess levels in healthy individuals. It might occur with supplement use, but generally the use of phosphorus supplements is not common and the amount of phosphorus in them is typically not high. (2) People with hyperphosphatemia may show no symptoms; others may develop calcium deposits and hardening of soft tissues in the body, such as in the kidney, resulting from a disruption in the normal metabolism of calcium.

üîó Diet Review: Anti-Inflammatory Diet
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/anti-inflammatory-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
An anti-inflammatory diet is promoted as a remedy to battle inflammation in the body. A common belief is that ‚Äúinflammation‚Äù is always bad. Although it produces unpleasant side effects, inflammation is actually a healthy response by ourimmune system. When a foreign invader enters the body such as bacteria, viruses, or allergens, or an injury occurs, our immune cells act quickly. We may sneeze or cough to rid the body of an offending agent. We may feel pain and swelling at the site of a cut or injury to signal us to be gentle with this delicate area. Blood flows in rapidly, which may produce warmth or redness. These are signs that our immune system is repairing damaged tissue or fighting invaders. As healing takes place, inflammation gradually subsides.
Inflammation becomes harmful when it is prolonged and begins to damage healthy cells, creating a pro-inflammatory state. Another problem is due to genetic deviants causing the body‚Äôs immune system to constantly attack cells. This sometimes occurs with autoimmune disorders like lupus, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and Crohn‚Äôs disease. Sometimes an unhealthy lifestyle from lack of exercise, high stress, and calorie-rich diets can trigger chronic low levels of inflammation throughout the entire body, termed metaflammation. [1,2] This type of low-grade inflammation does not usually produce noticeable symptoms, but over time metaflammation can pave the pathway for chronic conditions likecardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and certaincancers(e.g., breast, colon).
Anti-inflammatory diets may be promoted for these inflammatory conditions. They include several foods that are believed to interfere with the inflammatory process, though research on its exact mechanism is not conclusive. There is no single anti-inflammatory diet plan. Generally it emphasizes eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, unsaturated fats, minimally refined whole grains, tea, coffee, herbs, spices, and oily fish. TheMediterranean dietandDASH dietare popular dietary plans that already showcase many anti-inflammatory foods.
An anti-inflammatory diet plan not only highlights specific foods and food groups but limits other foods that may contribute to metaflammation such as fatty cuts ofred meat,refined sugary foodsandbeverages, and excessalcohol.
An anti-inflammatory diet does not follow strict rules about calories or portion sizes. It suggests a variety of anti-inflammatory foods to eat daily, rather than focusing on eating one or two specific foods or nutrients. This ensures a greater variety of protective food components, some of which may work synergistically toboost immunity. These foods provide plant chemicals (phytochemicals), antioxidants, and fiber that prevent cellular stresses, inhibit inflammatory signals caused by the immune system, promote healthygut microbiota, and slow down digestion to prevent surges in blood glucose. [3] They may also favorably affect the composition of fat cells to further reduce inflammation.
Other factors aside from diet may help to control inflammation, such asexercising regularly,controlling stress, andgetting enough sleep.
Most available research focuses on foods and dietary patterns that are associated with metaflammation, which in turn helps to determine the components of an anti-inflammatory diet. Metaflammation is especially associated with Western-type dietary patterns high in processed meats, saturated fat, refined sugars, salt, and white flour while being low in fiber, nutrients, and phytochemicals. [1,4] These diets also tend to be calorie-dense with a high glycemic load, potentially leading toblood sugar surges, insulin resistance, and excess weight gain. Studies have shown that Western diets are associated with increased blood markers of inflammation, though the connection may be due to a string of events rather than one direct action. [1] For example, exposure to air pollution and chronic mental stress can lead to an excess of free radicals produced in the body, which then oxidize and damage other molecules. Atherosclerosis is one condition in which these free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol particles. The actions of both oxidized LDL cholesterol and several types of immune cells form lesions and plaque in the heart arteries that can lead to ischemicheart disease(a type of heart disease caused by narrowed or partially blocked arteries). [5] A long-term diet that is high in saturated fat andcholesterolmay raise LDL levels, increasing the risk of free radical action that may promote this immune response, which partially contributes to a chronic low-level proinflammatory state.
A major cause of low-level inflammation is the build-up of fatty acids in fat tissue (and other tissues) promoted by a high-fat or high-sugar diet. This may cause fat tissue to send signals to immune cells that produce inflammation in various areas, including organs like the pancreas. An inflamed pancreas can then lead to insulin resistance and diabetes. Therefore, the combination of carrying extra body fat (obesity) and eating a diet high in saturated fat and refined sugars increases the risk of cell damage because of increased immune cell activity.
An anti-inflammatory diet contains foods rich in nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals and limits foods found in a typical Western diet to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. There is also emerging research studying the effects of high-fiber plant-rich diets that support a greater diversity ofbeneficial gut microbes, which may prevent a condition called metabolic endotoxemia. This is a low-grade inflammation that occurs because of an increase in the number of endotoxins, which are believed to cause the inflammation associated with metabolic diseases likecardiovascular diseaseandtype 2 diabetes. [6,7]
The most common causes of leaky gut are drug abuse and food toxins (for example, gluten acting as a toxin in susceptible people with celiac disease). Certain nutrients, such as the amino acids glutamine and tryptophan, have been shown in clinical trials to decrease intestinal permeability by improving the tight junctions. [28]Fiberin the diet can improve the diversity of bacteria in the gut that increases production of short chain fatty acids and other beneficial metabolites, which in turn strengthens the intestinal barrier. Foods rich inprebiotics and probiotics, and probiotic supplements, are also being studied. Much more research is needed to confirm the relationship of dysbiosis and inflammatory conditions, and potential treatments.
An anti-inflammatory diet is a healthful eating plan that may help to reduce chronic low levels of inflammation that otherwise might increase the risk of various chronic diseases. Although research is limited, it may also help to lower inflammatory markers in individuals with autoimmune-type inflammation such as with rheumatoid arthritis. Popular dietary patterns that are anti-inflammatory include the Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and vegetarian diets. People may seek the guidance of a registered dietitian familiar with any of these dietary patterns to assist with meal planning and appropriate portion sizes. Along with the diet, it is important to incorporate other healthy lifestyle factors that positively affect the body‚Äôs immune response, such as practicingstress reduction,exercising regularly, and getting adequatesleep.

üîó Cravings
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/cravings/

Most of us have experienced an intense urge to eat a certain food‚Äîideally right away. More often than not, that food is likely to be sugary, salty, or fatty, or all three. You may feel increasingly excited as you imagine how it will taste and how you‚Äôll feel eating it. Maybe you last ate several hours ago, or maybe you‚Äôre still digesting your last meal. These urges are called cravings, which can pop up at any moment, and aren‚Äôt always fueled by hunger pangs.
The terms ‚Äúsugar addict‚Äù or ‚Äúchocoholic‚Äù are often used, and people may blame cravings on a sweet tooth, bad eating habits, or lack of self-control. These may be true to a degree, but cravings actually involve a complex interplay of factors: brain messages, behaviors that become habits over time, and having easy access to food. Animal and human studies have shown that foods that stimulate the reward regions of the brain influence our food choices and eating behaviors. [1] When we eat certain foods, the neurons in the reward region become very active, creating highly positive feelings of pleasure so that we want to keep seeking these foods regularly. These foods are sometimes labeledhyperpalatablebecause they are easy to digest and have enjoyable qualities of sweetness, saltiness, or richness. Hyperpalatable foods can stimulate the release of metabolic, stress, and appetite hormones including insulin, cortisol, dopamine, leptin, and ghrelin, all of which play a role in cravings. [1]
Normally when eating a meal, appetite hormones are released. Examples are glucagon-like peptide and cholecystokinin from the digestive tract, and leptin from fat cells, which cause feelings of fullness and communicate with the brain to stop eating. On the flipside, if the body hasn‚Äôt received food for several hours, ghrelin is released from the stomach to signal hunger. Eating hyperpalatable foods too often might interfere with how the brain processes these hormonal signals so that one may feel continued cravings despite having eaten enough food. [1] Animal studies have shown that brain signals can become disrupted when eating a very high sugar or high fat diet, which may trigger the release of hormones that reduce stressful emotions and therefore lead to a habitual desire for these ‚Äúcomforting‚Äù foods. [2] Interestingly, human studies have also found associations with strong cravings andartificially sweetenedfoods and beverages (i.e., diet soda), as their intensely sweet flavor may produce the same rewarding effects as sugar. [3]
Although it‚Äôs pretty clear that certain foods have the ability to keep us coming back for more, it is less clear if food can be ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù in the same manner as drugs and alcohol. A food craving is an intense and persistent desire for a food, but that craving isn‚Äôt always for something delicious. It can also be caused by a nutritional deficiency, boredom, or self-imposed food restrictions. [4] A food addiction is one step beyond, including not only intense cravings but also exhibiting a loss of control of eating behaviors and repeated excess consumption of food, especially hyperpalatable foods. [6]
There is a lack of consensus if food addiction exists, or if some individuals who struggle to control their food intake can be considered food addicts. It remains a highly debated area. Some researchers argue that the defining features of drug and alcohol addiction are not seen with food addiction, while others feel they share similar traits related to neurological changes in the brain. [2,7,8]
Potential similarities of addictive substances and hyperpalatable foods in how they affect the brain: [4,9]
Animal studies have shown that hyperpalatable foods and addictive substances can cause imbalances in the brain‚Äôs reward system. ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù eating patterns are regulated by brain responses in the hypothalamus with the release of appetite hormones and chemicals so that one eats when hungry and stops when full. It is also believed that this reward system is overstimulated and disrupted so that a person may continually seek specific foods especially when feeling negative emotions like too much stress. [2] The repeated behavior over time of using hyperpalatable foods to produce pleasurable or calming emotions with the release of dopamine can condition the brain to seek out this response.
However, if there is a decreased response of the reward system (if, for example, less dopamine is secreted) one may experience less satisfaction after eating. As a result, one may eat larger amounts of hyperpalatable foods to try to achieve the same reward response. A similar effect, called tolerance, is seen with drug or alcohol addiction. Animal studies have shown that when cortisol is released with chronic stress, changes in the brain‚Äôs response can lead to lower dopamine levels and increased cravings. Stress has also been associated with increased levels of the hormone ghrelin, again causing stronger cravings.
High intakes of sugar have been studied to disrupt the body‚Äôs natural ability to sense hunger or satisfaction, so that people may keep eating despite being full, which can then alter the body‚Äôs natural homeostasis. [10] A review of clinical trials looking at the relationship of highly palatable sugary foods and negative emotions (stress, anxiety, depression, fear) found sugar to have addictive effects and cause changes in brain chemistry similar to other addictive substances, and the ability to produce negative withdrawal symptoms when stopping sugar intake. [2]
In his bookHooked, author Michael Moss questions what defines an addiction. Does it involve a substance that we repeatedly use (or eat) that has the potential to cause harm if taken excessively? [11] If so, then water might be considered an addiction, as we drink it daily and often crave it. If one drinks too much water, a dangerous condition called hyponatremia can result. Does an addiction involve taking a substance regularly that causes intense physical discomfort when stopping the substance? Then cocaine might not be considered an addiction, because although its withdrawal causes psychological symptoms, it does not cause physical symptoms as with alcohol. Determining an addiction is also complicated by the fact that signs and symptoms vary widely in individuals, based on their genes, body size, physical health, sex, and other factors.
According to the American Psychiatric Association‚ÄôsDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM),at least two criteria from the following are required for a diagnosis of addiction: cravings, tolerance (progressively needing higher amounts to experience reward), consuming more than intended, withdrawal, desire or unsuccessful efforts to quit use, a great deal of time spent in activities involved in use, continued use despite knowledge of problems associated with use, and interference with daily activities. [4]
The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize food addiction as an eating disorder or substance abuse disorder, but their DSM criteria were used as a basis for the creation of the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). [4] This scale is a validated measurement tool that identifies eating patterns that are similar to behaviors seen in classic areas of addiction. [12] Rather than just identifying overeating and cravings, the questions cover a range of behaviors, emotions (e.g., anxiety, agitation, distress), physical side effects (e.g., fatigue, withdrawal), and interference with daily work and social activities that are associated with eating certain types of foods.
A systematic review of all studies using the YFAS to assess food addiction found a prevalence of food addiction in almost 20% of the study population, with the highest rates in adult females older than 35 years and in participants with overweight/obesity. [13] Among those with a diagnosed eating disorder, the prevalence of food addiction was almost 58%. The most common symptom reported across all studies was ‚Äúpersistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down food intake.‚Äù The authors cautioned that the findings were not representative of a national population, as the main demographic in the studies sampled were females with overweight/obesity. A later systematic review with meta-analysis including 272 studies found a similar prevalence using the YFAS, with 20% of participants diagnosed with food addiction; 55% who were diagnosed with binge eating also had food addiction. [14] Patients who report binge eating tend to choose ultra-processed foods, commonly high in both carbohydrates and fats, and low in protein. [15] Research has shown that the specific combination of carbohydrate and fat activate the brain‚Äôs reward center associated with addictive behavior. [16]When looking at food addiction in higher-income regions in Latin American countries using the YFAS, the prevalence was about 15% of participants, and 38% in those who were diagnosed as overweight. [17]¬†In addition to using this scale to screen for individuals at risk for food addiction and diagnosable eating disorders, it may also be useful to identify any markers that show a progressive transition from impulsive eating events to compulsive eating behaviors to addictive behaviors. [4]
Snacks are big business and the food industry spends more than $10 billion yearly on snack food advertising. [18] Many snacks fall into the category of hyperpalatable foods that can stimulate brain reward pathways. These ‚Äúcraveable‚Äù foods include potato chips, crackers, ice cream, soda, candy, and fast food meals, with high amounts of sugar, salt, and fat that send messages to the brain to ‚Äúeat me!‚Äù. Just watching a 30-second television ad or seeing photos on social media of these delicious foods can spark cravings.
Many ads for unhealthy snack foods and beverages are directed towards children and are considered a key component in an environment that promotes overeating, poor dietary behaviors, and obesity. [19,20] Increased exposure to food advertising is associated with a higher calorie intake and increased preference for hyperpalatable foods from those ads. [21-23] Children have the highest exposures, because screen time through handheld devices has become a prevalent recreational activity whether it be television, social media, or online gaming. Surprisingly, educational websites also ranked in the top 10 for snack, sugary drink, fast food, and sugary cereal ads. [19]
Whereas acute sudden stress tends to suppress appetite, longer-lasting chronic stress isassociated with cravings for hyperpalatable high-fat calorie-dense foods. [24] Thisassociation may be caused by disturbances of messages to the brain that cause the release ofcortisol, which stimulates appetite and cravings. Read more about howchronic stress affectseating patterns.
Adequate sleep helps to regulate metabolic functions, and a lack of sleep is associated with imbalances in leptin and ghrelin levels. These hormonal fluctuations may lead to overeating due to cravings for sweet, starchy, high-fat, and salty foods. [25] Read more aboutsleep deficiency and eating behaviors.
Exercise typically lowers levels of appetite-stimulating ghrelin and increases appetite-suppressing leptin and glucagon-like peptide, at least in the short term. [26] However, there are several factors that can influence how much exercise affects one‚Äôs appetite. The longer the duration and the higher the intensity of a workout, the more likely one‚Äôs appetite shuts down, as blood is quickly moved away from the gut and to the heart and muscles to supply oxygen. [27] After exercising, normal hunger signaling gradually resumes. A shorter, less intense workout such as a moderate walk on a treadmill for 20 minutes may not have any effect on the appetite.
In women, hormones fluctuate during various phases of their menstrual cycle. When estrogen levels are low and progesterone is high, one may feel increased cravings and less satisfied after eating. The brain has receptors for estrogen, and higher levels of estrogen are associated with fullness and satisfaction after eating. [28] Estrogen also suppresses hunger by decreasing levels of ghrelin and increasing the effectiveness of cholecystokinin, an appetite-suppressing hormone. [29] Most research in this area has been with animal studies, but it is a topic of ongoing interest, especially in women who experience weight gain and who have low estrogen levels due to menopause or medical treatments that suppress estrogen (e.g., some chemotherapies).
In some people, drugs like antidepressants (e.g., sertraline, mirtazapine, paroxetine) and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine, aripiprazole) can increase appetite and weight. [30] The mechanism explaining why this happens isn‚Äôt clearly understood, but a change in metabolism and altered brain messages that signal appetite are suspected. These antidepressants interfere with the neurotransmitter serotonin, which regulates mood and appetite. Another medication that increases appetite is prednisone, a steroid sometimes given to replete low cortisol levels with certain health conditions. Prednisone can promote leptin resistance so that leptin does not work properly to suppress appetite, causing one to feel persistent hunger.

üîó The Science of Snacking
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/snacking/

Are snacks good or bad for you? A snack is generally defined as any food eaten between main meals. Many people snack at least once during the course of a day, and there are several reasons why. The most common scenario is that our stomachs start growling a few hours after our last meal. Another might be a dip an energy levels that a small bite can remedy. Or maybe we just look forward to the taste of certain snack foods.
Market research in the U.S. shows the most common snack choices are fruit, cookies, chips, ice cream, candy, popcorn, soft drinks, crackers, cake, milk, nuts and seeds, tea, and yogurt. [1] Snacks have been associated with both weight gain and maintaining weight, as well as with a lower or higher diet quality. [1,2] Although snacks can be a regular and important part of a healthy diet, they can also lead to health problems. What differentiates the two scenarios is one‚Äôs snacking behavior: what you snack on, why you snack, frequency of snacking, and how snacks fit into your overall eating plan.
The 2020 Food & Health Survey from the International Food Information Council revealed several insights into how Americans snack. [5]
In children, snacking makes up about 27% of their daily calorie intake and there has been a substantial increase in snacking habits over the past few decades. [4] American children tend to consume snacks that are calorie-rich and nutrient-poor, which is concerning when more than 30% of children and adolescents are overweight or obese. [6] Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey show that children do not obtain enough calcium, vitamin D, fiber, and potassium, but have high intakes of calories, carbohydrates, and sodium. [6] Snacks such as low-sugar yogurt, fresh fruit, raw vegetables, and nuts can help provide these needed nutrients in young children and preadolescents while controlling excess calories.
Research has attempted to see if snacking has a positive or negative impact on nutrition and health outcomes‚Äîbut without a clear answer. [7] This may be because of a lack of a common scientific definition of what is a snack. Studies find that snacking recommendations from public health organizations worldwide generally advise limiting snacks that offer little nutrition but are high in saturated fat, sugar, and sodium; they find that snacks provide at least 10% of daily calories, with a frequency of eating about two snacks per day. [7,8] The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 includes recommendations for nutrient-dense snacks, such as raw vegetables, fresh fruit, nuts, and plain yogurt. [9]
We know that snacks are meant to be satisfying small bites between meals. But some studies show that snacking can lead to weight gain. [2] Although eating too many snacks may be the obvious reason, there are several subtle factors that can feed this occurrence. [4,8]
Simply being aware of these factors can help reduce the chances of snack overload. Usemindfulness strategiessuch as being intentional about snack choices, savoring small bites and chewing thoroughly, eating slowly, and using the senses to fully appreciate the colors, textures, and tastes of snacks.
The concept ofmeal planningcan be applied to snacks. Take the time to incorporate snack planning to ensure that snacks work for you, not against you. Follow these simple steps and ask yourself:

üîó Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 released
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2021/01/12/2020-dietary-guidelines/

The 9th edition of theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025is out, with the tagline toMake Every Bite Count. Intended for policy makers, healthcare providers, nutrition educators, and Federal nutrition program operators, the new edition has expanded to almost 150 pages, providing nutrition guidelines for even more age groups throughout the life cycle. As in theprevious edition, the Dietary Guidelines emphasize dietary patterns rather than promoting specific nutrients or foods. This allows for greater flexibility in food choices, as health benefits are achieved by consuming a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods across different food categories, rather than a few ‚Äúsuperfoods.‚Äù In addition, the Dietary Guidelines again emphasize how nutrition educators need to be aware that food choices are strongly impacted by age, race, cultural traditions, environment,food access,budget, and personal beliefs and preferences. [1]
The key players in the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern‚Äù remain unchanged from the previous edition of the Guidelines:
Dietary components to limit:
The guidelines carry over the same limits for saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, but this time include a specific age range:
While the Guidelines include dietary patterns that remain examples of healthy diets (‚ÄúHealthy Mediterranean-Style Pattern,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealthy Vegetarian Pattern‚Äù), the dietary targets for the ‚ÄúHealthy U.S.-Style Pattern‚Äù emphasize a diet relatively high in meat, eggs, and dairy foods. Dr.Walter Willett, Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said this about the new Guidelines:
In general, there was minimal change from the last edition of the Guidelines, which did include many positive suggestions. However, guidance that considers scientific evidence on specific protein sources and health, and also the environmental consequences of dietary patterns, is needed to provide Americans with advice and policies for healthy and sustainable diets. The current Dietary Guidelines fail to do this.
Like theprevious edition, the Guidelines are¬†silent on the environmental impacts of their dietary targets, which other analyses show would have serious impacts on climate change and other environmental footprints because of the relatively large amounts of meat and dairy foods recommended. [2] Along with varying impacts on human health, different foods also havediffering impacts on the environment. The production of animal-based foods tends to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based foods‚Äîand red meat (especially beef) and dairy stand out for their disproportionate impact.
Willett points out that the Guidelines‚Äô continued dairy recommendation of 3 servings¬†per day has never been justifiedby evidence for health outcomes, and the guidance for low-fat and fat-free dairy products doesn‚Äôt detail a plan for disposal of the fat naturally present in milk:
Because the disposal of dairy fat would be hugely wasteful, it would almost certainly remain in the food supply, which makes this recommendation somewhat of a fantasy. The report does appropriately mention thatsoymilk is an alternative to cow milk, but to avoid the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with dairy food consumption at three servings per day, the majority of milk and dairy foods would need to beplant-based.
Similarly, the Guidelines also recommend lean meats, but don‚Äôt discuss the fate of cuts of meat that are not lean. Willett says that realistically,¬†they would almost certainly be consumed, ‚Äúprobably as cheap cuts and processed meats, especially by low-income groups who already experience excess rates of obesity and diabetes.‚Äù
It‚Äôs notable that the overall protein recommendation leads with ‚Äúlean meats,‚Äù which could be interpreted by consumers as including ‚Äúlean‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-fat‚Äù cuts of bacon or other processed meats. Although further guidance clarifies that ‚Äúmost intake of meats and poultry should be from fresh, frozen, or canned, and in lean forms (e.g., chicken breast or ground turkey) versus processed meats (e.g., hot dogs, sausages, ham, luncheon meats),‚Äù [1] this statement is buried within the chapters of the guidelines, rather than emphasized within the summarized protein recommendation. This is a particularly important distinction, since consuming healthy protein sources like beans, nuts, fish, or poultry in place of red meat and processed meat canlower the risk of several diseases and premature death.

üîó Dairy
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/dairy/

Dairy foods include a range of food and beverage products that make up classic combinations: cereal with milk, cheese and crackers, yogurt and berries, ice cream sundaes. While ice cream and cream cheese are examples of indulgent dairy foods that are viewed as every-so-often treats, a lack of clarity exists over other dairy foods that offer protein, calcium, vitamin D, and other healthful nutrients. Ischeesea healthy food? Is non/low-fatmilkandyogurtbetter for the heart than full-fat versions? Traditionally, whole milk dairy products have been viewed as the less healthful choice because of their predominant type of fat‚Äîsaturated fat.
Saturated fats were targeted in the 1970s and 1980s as potentially causing harm to health. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1980 recommended choosing non/low-fat dairy foods in place of full-fat versions (except for young children). In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools in the U.S. to replace whole milk with non/low-fat unflavored milk or non-fat flavored milk. Sales of low-fat and fat-free milks, yogurts, and cheeses skyrocketed despite complaints about their lack of flavor and satisfaction. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend three 1-cup (8 ounce) servings of non/low-fat milk or similar amounts of low-fat cheese, yogurt, or other dairy foods for adults and children over 9 years old to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of bone fractures. [1]
To the surprise of many, research in the 2000s defied these longstanding guidelines to suggest that full-fat dairy foods might be just as healthful as their lower-fat counterparts, provoking scientists to look more closely at all dairy products. Upon closer examination, they realized that dairy foods are not one and the same. The fermentation process required to make cheese and yogurt may impart unique health benefits as well as improved digestibility from a lower lactose content. That said,howpeople eat dairy is important to consider. Take cheese for example: is it consumed melted on fast-food burgers, pasta, and pizza that are already high in refined carbohydrate, sodium, and saturated fat? Or is it served in thin wedges, eaten with fresh fruit as a snack or dessert? Another key point is frequency and amount. If people drink several glasses of low-fat milk or snack on reduced-fat cheese throughout the day, they might end up eating as much saturated fat (or more) than if they had consumed one glass of whole milk or serving of full-fat cheese.
These questions are important to consider when reviewing scientific research on dairy foods.
Dairy foods like milk, ice cream, cream, and soft cheeses like cottage and ricotta are high in lactose. Yogurt and aged cheeses are low in lactose because their production involves fermentation by natural bacteria that break down and consume the lactose. This is why some people with lactose intolerance may be able to safely consume some types of cheese and yogurt without side effects. Lactaid pills are a commercial product that contains the lactase enzyme that breaks down lactose, and can be taken before meals containing dairy to help reduce uncomfortable side effects. Lactaid milk is cow‚Äôs milk that contains the lactase enzyme so the product is very low in lactose.
The nutrients and types of fat in dairy are involved with bone health, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions. Calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus are important for bone building, and the high potassium content of dairy foods can help lower blood pressure.
Studies on dairy have limitations that may be a cause of seemingly conflicting findings. In observational studies, people who consume a high amount of milk may be different from those who do not in ways that are not fully captured by statistical adjustments. Randomized clinical trials tend to be short in duration with a small number of participants, making it difficult to see possible effects of dairy intake on chronic diseases like heart disease and bone fractures that take years to develop. Thus, longer-term epidemiological studies may provide additional insights.
The recommendations for dairy foods from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 are based on short-term clinical trials that have shown that higher intakes of calcium result in small increases in bone mineral density. However, after one year the differences in bone density are not significant compared with a placebo. [2] Meta-analyses of prospective studies have not found an association of total dairy food intake and hip fracture risk. [3,4]
The effects of dairy foods are of special interest with children due to calcium and vitamin D playing an important role in bone growth. These nutrients are essential, but the critical question is the amount needed to minimize bone fracture risk.
Sometimes research looks at calcium intakes compared with calcium balance (how much calcium is eaten from foods and supplements compared with how much calcium is lost by the body). Calcium balance is positive during growing phases, such as in childhood and adolescence. Calcium balance is negative in the elderly, when the risk of bone loss increases. Studies have found that amount of calcium needed to achieve positive calcium balance varies among groups of people. Although the U.S. recommendation of about 3 cups daily of milk or dairy foods daily provides about 900-1000 mg calcium, some studies have shown that children and adults can achieve positive calcium balance with as little as 400 mg daily. [7,8]
More than half of the type of fat in dairy is saturated, which is a known risk factor forheart diseaseand the reason why the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends only non/low-fat dairy products. However, removing one type of food from the diet usually means replacing it with another. Swapping saturated fat with low-fat foods but also possibly more refined carbohydrates may help to lower LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol but can raise triglycerides, a different risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High blood levels of triglycerides can lead to hardening of the arteries.
The evidence on dairy foods and their relation totype 2 diabetesmellitus (T2DM) is inconclusive. While population studies on total dairy intake tend to show little or no association with T2DM, closer evaluations of specific foods like yogurt suggest a possible protective effect. The protein and probiotics in yogurt may help to lower blood glucose and affect gut microbiota that prevents weight gain. [13]
The types of saturated fats in dairy have also gained greater attention, as some types of saturated fatty acids in dairy are different than those in red meat, and may have a more neutral effect on blood cholesterol.¬† A study of 3,333 adults from the Nurses‚Äô Health Study and Health Professional‚Äôs Follow-up Study assessed the participants‚Äô blood levels of various dairy fatty acids. [16] It found that higher blood levels of these saturated fatty acids were associated with less incidents of T2DM. However, it is possible the metabolic abnormalities that precede the diagnosis of T2DM by many years may have affected the blood levels of these fatty acids.
It has been speculated that although full-fat dairy contains more calories and fat than reduced-fat dairy, full-fat versions may taste better and be more filling. This in turn might prevent extra snacking between meals or even eating less over the course of a day. However, randomized clinical trials have not shown an overall effect of dairy foods on weight loss or body weight changes. [17] In a large prospective study of three cohorts of men and women, intakes of low-fat and whole milk and cheese had no association with weight changes, though yogurt in the diet was associated with less weight gain over time.[18]
The fat in dairy foods contains estrogenic hormones that are associated with a higher risk of some hormone-related cancers. High amounts of dairy foods in the diet have been associated with certain cancers, including endometrial and prostate, but with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for breast cancer have not been consistent [8].
The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day). 250 grams is about one (8-ounce) cup ofmilk,yogurt, or equivalent amounts ofcheese(because milk is about 90% water, this amounts to about 1 oz of hard cheese). If everyone were¬† to consume 2 servings of dairy per day, climate change would be difficult to control. [26]
Both full-fat and non/low-fat dairy foods can be good sources of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin D. Dairy foods that undergo fermentation, such asyogurtandsome cheeses, are lower in lactose and contain healthful gut bacteria that may benefit digestive health. However, the nutrients inmilkcan be found in other foods and therefore it is not an essential food even for the normal growth and development in children and for the prevention of health conditions like bone fractures.
Although full-fat dairy foods are high in saturated fat, whether full-fat dairy is more harmful (or more beneficial) to health than non/low-fat dairy will depend on the sources calories that replace the dairy fat. If this is sugar there may be little difference, but if this is unsaturated fat (such as in nuts or plant oils), the lower fat version would be better. The total amount of dairy consumption is also important; at only one serving per day, the amount of fat would not be important, whereas it would with 3 or more servings per day. Thus, while more research emerges, the type of dairy one incorporates into their dietary pattern can be a matter of personal preference. Some people enjoy using non-fat milk in their cereal or eating a low-fat Greek yogurt. Others may find that choosing a richer full-fat yogurt as an afternoon snack works well to prevent extra snacking before dinner. The overall dietary pattern is key, andcreating a balanced plateallows for 0 to 2 servings daily of dairy (of any type) can be healthy.

üîó Cheese
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/cheese/

Cheese is an age-old staple, beloved for its richness, creaminess, flavor, and satiating qualities. It was discovered in ancient civilizations during the rise of agriculture and domestication of sheep and goats for their milk. By accident, when the milk was left sitting out in the sun for hours, it turned sour and the protein components curdled into solids. When the liquid portion, or whey, was drained and removed leaving only the solid curds, farmers realized these curds had a pleasing taste.
Since then, countries around the world have experimented with cheese-making, varying the types of milk, how long the cheese is allowed to age and ripen, and using different additives like salt or acid to produce unique textures and flavors. India is known for its mild-tasting soft paneer, Greece discovered salty crumbly feta made from sheep or goat‚Äôs milk, and Sardinia developed the hard, pungent grating cheese called Pecorino Romano.
Cheese is a nutrient-densedairy food, providing protein, fats, and minerals. Some hard block cheeses that contain little moisture like Parmigiano-Reggiano and aged cheddar are easily stored and travel well because they do not require refrigeration. Cheese may be better tolerated than milk in some people because it is lower in lactose, a type of sugar that is not easily digested if people lack the enzyme to break it down.
The nutrients in cheese vary. One ounce of hard cheese, or a wedge about the size of your thumb, contains about 120 calories, 8 grams (g) of protein, 6 g saturated fat, and 180 milligrams (mg) of calcium. A half-cup of soft cheese like 4% full-fat cottage cheese has about 120 calories, 14 g protein, 3 g saturated fat, and 80 mg of calcium. Most cheeses are high in sodium with 300-450 mg per serving because salt is a key ingredient to hold moisture and prevent overgrowth of bacteria. However, some cheeses like goat, whole-milk mozzarella, and Swiss are low in sodium with only 50-100 mg per serving.
Full-fatdairy foodscontain a high amount of saturated fat and some cholesterol. Milk fat is about 70% saturated fat, 25% monounsaturated, and 5% polyunsaturated. Because a high intake of saturated fat can increase LDL cholesterol levels, and because cheese is often high in sodium, it is generally recommended to eat cheese in limited amounts as its components may exert a negative health effect.
However, there is ongoing debate about the impact of cheese on health. Though the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend choosing low-fat dairy (milk,yogurt, and cheese) to preventcardiovascular disease(CVD), some reports suggest that full-fat dairy may lower risk of CVD andtype 2 diabetes. [1] It is suggested in these studies that perhaps specific nutrients in cheese may be protective for the heart, like calcium and conjugated linoleic acid, and that the types of saturated fatty acids in cheese have a different effect on the heart than other types such as that in red meat. During the processing of some cheeses, bacteria are added during the fermentation stage, which may alter its effects on blood cholesterol. However, this is a fairly new theory with early evidence arising mainly fromcertain cheeses manufactured with probiotics.
An important point to consider is that many published studies showing a health benefit of cheese are funded by industries such as dairy associations or large commercial corporations that sell dairy foods. The studies discussed below did not have industry conflicts of interest, to the best of our knowledge.
It appears that cheese might have some benefit with strokes and weight changes, specifically when replacing red meat in the diet. That said, the dietary patterns associated with cheese intake can make a difference. In the U.S. for example, cheese is often added to a pizza or burger containing refined grains, meats high in saturated fats, and sodium. Such a dietary pattern is likely to have an adverse health effect regardless of the amount of cheese consumed.
This last study highlights an important consideration: the foods eaten with cheese may affect not only weight but also potentially other health outcomes. Is cheese served with a high saturated fat food like bacon or a hamburger on a high-glycemic-load white bun? Is it melted over eggs cooked in butter, which introduces cholesterol and additional saturated fat? Or is it paired with fresh fruit or nuts, grilled on whole grain toast, or just enjoyed alone? How cheese is eaten may lead to different health outcomes.
Bottom line:Although cheese is high in saturated fat and sodium, it is also rich in calcium and protein, and some fermented types contain probiotics. One can enjoy a modest amount of cheese as part of a healthful diet, but how it is eaten is key. Eating cheese with foods like refined grains (white pasta, bread, crackers, etc.) and processed meats may negate its health benefits. On the other hand, cheese may provide health benefits if consumed as a replacement for red and processed meats or eaten as a snack instead of potato chips (althoughnutswould still be a healthier snack option!).
The production ofdairy foodsplaces considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day, with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day. 250 grams is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk, or equivalent amounts of cheese (because milk is about 90% water, this amounts to about 1 oz of hard cheese).
There are three main components for making cheese: the milk, a coagulant, and bacterial cultures. Cheese is made mostly of milk, whether from cows, sheep, goats, buffalo or a blend of these milks. A coagulant is a substance added to milk to help solids form out of the liquid portion. This is typically an acid like vinegar, or rennet, a natural enzyme found in the stomach lining of cows. Starter bacteria are added to help with coagulation, impart flavor and texture, and prevent the growth of harmful organisms. They feed on lactose sugar in the milk. You can see the work of bacteria in the eye holes in Swiss cheese or in the pungency of sharp cheddar. Sometimes molds are added that produce an unusual appearance like the greyish-blue veins in blue cheese and the hard rinds of Brie and Camembert.
Pasteurized or raw milk may be used. Both types of milk are heated to a temperature to allow the starter bacteria to grow and ferment the milk. If raw milk is used, the cheese must further be aged for at least two months to reduce the exposure to harmful pathogens present in the milk. A coagulant is then added with heat, after which the whey is drained out. At this point, salt or herbs may be added and the cheese may be pressed into blocks. Depending on the type of cheese, it will be stored from months to years until the desired ripening and aging is achieved.

üîó Milk
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/milk/

Milk is the liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals, including humans. Breast milk is the preferred food for infants, as it is well-tolerated while their digestive tracts develop and mature.Dairymilk may be introduced at later ages if tolerated well. Although dairy milk may come from any mammal, cows, goats, buffalo, and sheep are common producers.This section will focus on dairy milk from cows, and briefly discuss non-dairy plant milk alternatives.
Whole cow‚Äôs milk contains about 87% water. The remaining 13% contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Processing techniques remove fat to produce lower fat varieties: ‚Äúreduced fat‚Äù contains 2% milkfat, ‚Äúlowfat‚Äù contains 1% milkfat, and ‚Äúnonfat‚Äù or ‚Äúskim‚Äù has virtually no milkfat. Cows are often pregnant while they are milked, so dairy milk contains hormones like insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), estrogens, and progestins. Some cows are given additional hormones to increase milk production.
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends including three 8-ounce servings of milk daily (or equal portions of other dairy foods like cheese or yogurt), which is justified to increase calcium intake and reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Marketing efforts such as the iconic ‚ÄúGot Milk?‚Äù campaign with celebrities donning milk mustaches spread this message as well. However, research has not shown a consistent benefit on bone health with high intakes of milk, and furthermore has suggested potential harm with certain conditions like prostate cancer. [1]
Research on milk often produces contrary findings. Some reasons may be the wide range of different nutritional qualities in milk and how milk intake is measured, as seen in the following factors:
The connection of milk andcardiovascular disease(CVD) is unclear. Whole milk contains saturated fat, which is known to increase total cholesterol, raising both LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù and HDL ‚Äúgood‚Äù cholesterol levels. However, the minerals in milk, specifically calcium and potassium may help to control blood pressure.
Comparison of milk with other foods in the diet can affect study results. For example, if comparing milk with high saturated fat meats, milk may show no difference in heart health. However, if dairy fat in milk is compared with unsaturated plant oils, nuts, or seeds, milk may appear to increase CVD risk.
Milk contains nutrients important for bone health: calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein. However, an association with milk intake and decreased hip fractures has not been made.
Interestingly, the countries with the highest intakes of milk and calcium have the highest hip fracture rates. [8] Yet it‚Äôs unclear that milk alone is responsible because these studies are epidemiological and find associations rather than direct causes. It is known that higher milk intake tends to increase height, and a taller height is strongly related to fractures of the hip and other bones, particularly in men. [9]
Two meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies did not find an association between milk intake and risk of hip fractures. [10, 11] This result was found even with high milk intakes of 3-4 glasses a day.
Although it is believed that high calcium intakes at preadolescent and adolescent years may protect against bone loss later in life, studies have not supported this. The Recommended Daily Allowance for calcium in the U.S. for preadolescents ages 9-13 years is 1300 mg daily, but the calcium recommendations in other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom are only on average 750 mg daily. Drinking three servings of milk daily for 18 months in adolescent boy and girls with a low calcium intake did not effect bone mass. [12] For further nutritional guidance for children and adolescents, visit Harvard‚ÄôsKid‚Äôs Healthy Eating Plate.
Contrary to widespread belief, research does not support that milk helps with weight control. Although a meta-analysis of 29 randomized controlled trials found that milk and other dairy foods were beneficial for body fat reduction in the short-term and if calories were restricted, no benefits on body weight were seen in the long-term and when calories were not restricted. [13] A later meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials found similar beneficial effects of dairy intake on body weight and body fat when calories were limited, but without a calorie restriction, weight gain was likely. [14]
A large study of more than 12,000 adolescents looked to see if total milk helped to prevent weight gain. It found that dairy fat was not associated with weight gain, but a high intake of low-fat milk (more than 3 servings daily) was associated with weight gain and higher body mass index, mainly from the extra calories obtained. [15]
The association of milk anddiabetesis unclear. Dairy foods are associated with a moderately lower risk of type 2 diabetes in cohort studies, but the benefit mainly appears with eating fermented milk products like yogurt rather than from milk. [16, 17] Although the action of yogurt in benefiting diabetes is unclear, it contains helpful bacteria that may reduce inflammation or improve the action of the body‚Äôs natural insulin.
Higher milk intake is associated with increased incidence of prostate cancer. The Physicians‚Äô Health Study of 21,660 men found that an intake of more than 2.5 servings of dairy foods daily (compared with a half or less serving daily) was associated with a 12% increased risk prostate cancer. In men who consumed 1 or more servings of milk daily (compared with rarely consumed), skim milk was associated with an increased risk of early stage prostate cancer, and whole milk was associated with fatal advanced prostate cancer. [18]
A meta-analysis of 111 cohort studies by the World Cancer Research Fund found a decreased risk of colorectal cancer with higher milk intake but mostly in men. This is possibly due to the high calcium content in milk, a mineral found to be protective of colorectal cancer. [19]
Bottom line:The health benefits of dairy foods appear to be stronger for fermented types likeyogurt, which play a role in thegut microbiome. Milk possesses several individual nutrients that can affect blood pressure and bone health, but some of their health-promoting effects may be weakened by whole milk‚Äôs high saturated fat content. Although popular media articles have speculated that whole milk is not less healthful than skim milk, research has not supported this statement in regards to diabetes and heart disease, and a high intake of any type of milk can lead to weight gain due to the extra calories.
The name A2 milk may sound like a futuristic space food, but it is a type of milk now sold in some stores. A1 and A2 are two types of gene variants of casein, a protein in cow‚Äôs milk. The digestion and breakdown of casein produces a peptide (BCM-7) that has been associated with inflammation, digestive discomfort, and even some chronic diseases. [20] Some animal studies have shown that A1 milk has 4 times the amount of BCM-7 than A2 milk. Certain cattle breeds possess more of the A1 gene variant than A2, and visa versa. [20]
Through epidemiological studies and animal studies, a high intake of A1 casein has been associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease, increased incidence of type 1 diabetes, and some neurological disorders such as autism. [21]
However, a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a summary report after conducting a review of the literature. Some of their findings:
A2 milk distributers market their product as beneficial for adults, children, and infants who experience milk intolerances, whether from milk allergy or lactose intolerance. Symptoms of these conditions include gas, bloating, constipation, or diarrhea. However, it is noted that the majority of clinical trials comparing A1 with A2 milk, with findings showing improved tolerance and less gastrointestinal side effects with A2 milk, are funded by the A2 Corporation, producer of the brand ‚Äúa2 Milk‚Äù that is sold worldwide.
Bottom line:although milk with the A2 gene variant may be metabolized differently in the body than A1 milk, there is not enough evidence from research to show that these differences significantly affect health. If one has lactose intolerance or a milk allergy causing unpleasant symptoms, A2 milk may be tried. Plant-based milks are another option as they do not contain lactose or the milk protein casein.
Although fans of raw milk believe it tastes better and offers more nutrients than processed milk, raw milk is not pasteurized and may harbor harmful bacteria includingSalmonella, ListeriaandE. coli. Currently, twenty states prohibit the sale of raw milk. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness than illnesses related to pasteurized dairy products. Between 1993 and 2006 more than 1,500 people in the U.S. became ill from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. [22] Raw milk and soft cheeses made from raw milk like Brie, Camembert, Queso Blanco, and Queso Fresco are especially dangerous for older adults, those with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and children. In pregnant women,Listeriacan cause miscarriage, or illness or death of a fetus or newborn.
The production ofdairy foodsplaces considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day), which is about one (8-ounce) cup of milk.
Milk is often sold in cartons or opaque containers because too much exposure to light can cause a loss of vitamin A and B2. Choose a carton with the latest sell-by or use-by date (indicating it is the freshest). Most milk sold in supermarkets is pasteurized and homogenized, processing techniques that use heat to kill most of the bacteria present and break down fat molecules so that texture of milk remains smooth and creamy.
*Some sugars are created in the processing of oats to make oat milk, which are listed as ‚Äúadded sugars‚Äù even if no other sweeteners are added.
Milk requires refrigeration at a temperature below 40 F. If it has been stored at room temperature for two hours or longer, it is recommended to discard it. Although pasteurization kills much of the bacteria in milk, any remaining bacteria can grow quickly in milk at room temperature or warmer. Once milk is opened, it will last about 3-5 days after the sell-by date on the label. Spoiled milk has a strong, sour odor and lumpy texture caused by excess bacteria producing lactic acid, which curdles the protein in milk and produces off odors.
Store milk towards the rear of the refrigerator rather than the front or side shelf door, where the temperature varies the most. Don‚Äôt forget to close the carton or recap the bottle to prevent the milk from absorbing the odors and flavors of other foods in the refrigerator.
Lactose-free milk undergoes pasteurization and the addition of an enzyme lactase, which breaks down the milk sugar lactose, so it generally lasts longer than regular milk. If refrigerated properly, lactose-free milk can last about 7 days after the sell-by date once it is opened.
Milk is not just for drinking by the glass or splashing onto cold cereal. Adding milk to foods can boost one‚Äôs intake of calcium, vitamin D, protein, and other nutrients.
Several other animals produce milk including sheep, goat, and yaks. These types of milk are more popular in European, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries than in the U.S. Sheep‚Äôs milk can be made into various cheeses like feta and ricotta, and goat‚Äôs milk produces a popular cheese called goat cheese or chevre.
How do they compare nutritionally? Sheep, goat, and yak milks contain about the same if not more calcium than cow‚Äôs milk. The amount of protein and carbohydrate are about the same. They all contain some lactose but less than found in cow‚Äôs milk, so they may be easier to digest for people with lactose sensitivity.

üîó Calcium
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/

Calcium is a mineral most often associated with healthy bones and teeth, although it also plays an important role in blood clotting, helping muscles to contract, and regulating normal heart rhythms and nerve functions. About 99% of the body‚Äôs calcium is stored in bones, and the remaining 1% is found in blood, muscle, and other tissues.
In order to perform these vital daily functions, the body works to keep a steady amount of calcium in the blood and tissues. If calcium levels drop too low in the blood, parathyroid hormone (PTH) will signal the bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. This hormone may also activate vitamin D to improve the absorption of calcium in the intestines. At the same time, PTH signals the kidneys to release less calcium in the urine. When the body has enough calcium, a different hormone called calcitonin works to do the opposite: it lowers calcium levels in the blood by stopping the release of calcium from bones and signaling the kidneys to rid more of it in the urine.
The body gets the calcium it needs in two ways. One is by eating foods or supplements that contain calcium, and the other is by drawing from calcium in the body. If one does not eat enough calcium-containing foods, the body will remove calcium from bones. Ideally, the calcium that is ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from the bones will be replaced at a later point. But this doesn‚Äôt always happen, and can‚Äôt always be accomplished just by eating more calcium.
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium for women 19-50 years of age is 1,000 mg daily; for women 51+, 1,200 mg. For pregnant and lactating women, the RDA is 1,000 mg. For men 19-70 years of age, the RDA is 1,000 mg; for men 71+ years, 1,200 mg. [1]
The reviews below specifically looked at the effect of calcium on various health conditions. Scroll down for links to more information on the health effect of specific foods rich in calcium.
Several literature reviews on the topic of total calcium intake, from food and supplements, and blood pressure have suggested a possible link to lowering high blood pressure. However, problems with study designs in these analyses (small numbers of participants, differences among the people studied, and various biases in the types of studies included) prevent a new recommendation for the treatment of high blood pressure that would increase calcium intake above the Recommended Dietary Allowance. [2] Larger trials with longer duration are needed to clarify whether increased calcium intakes or the use of calcium supplements can lower high blood pressure.
Some research has raised concerns about calcium supplements andheart health. These studies found that taking calcium supplements increased the risk of cardiovascular events in men and women. It has been suggested that high-dose supplements can cause hypercalcemia (toxic level of calcium in the blood) that can cause blood to clot or the arteries to harden, leading to cardiovascular disease. The connection is not yet clear, but a clinical guideline published after review of the available research from the National Osteoporosis Foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology stated that calcium from food or supplements has no relationship (beneficial or harmful) to cardiovascular disease in generally healthy adults. The guideline advises people not to exceed the Upper Limit for calcium, that is, 2,000-2,500 mg daily from food and supplements. [3]
Calcium is one of the most important nutrients required for bone health. Bone is living tissue that is always in flux. Throughout the lifespan, bones are constantly being broken down and built up in a process known as remodeling. Bone cells called osteoblasts build bone, while other bone cells called osteoclasts break down bone if calcium is needed. In healthy individuals who get enough calcium and physical activity, bone production exceeds bone destruction up to about age 30. After that, destruction typically exceeds production. This is sometimes called ¬†‚Äúnegative calcium balance,‚Äù which can lead to bone loss. Women tend to experience greater bone loss than men later in life due to menopause, a condition that lowers the amount of hormones that help to build and preserve bone. Getting enough dietary calcium at all ages may help to slow the degree of bone loss, but calcium intakes at any level are not known to completely prevent bone loss. [4] Calcium is less easily absorbed at later ages, and therefore eating a very high amount of calcium will not always resolve the problem. Studies on calcium intake and bone density in postmenopausal women have mixed results. Possible reasons:
Because the results of some large trials found that higher calcium intakes (usually achieved with a supplement) was associated with improved bone density and slightly lower risk of hip fractures, the RDA for calcium for postmenopausal women is higher than at younger ages. [5] Some studies suggest that frail elderly (80 years and older living in institutions) may benefit from supplementation more than ‚Äúyounger‚Äù elderly who live independently in the community. [6]A 2018 review of randomized controlled trials by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find that supplements with calcium and vitamin D taken for up to 7 years reduced the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women. These women did not have osteoporosis or a vitamin D deficiency at the start of the study and lived independently in the community. The amount of calcium of the supplements ranged from 600-1,600 mg daily. [7]
Epidemiological studies following people over time suggest a protective role of high calcium intakes (whether from food and/or supplements) from colorectal cancer. [8] However, randomized controlled trials using calcium supplements, with our without vitamin D, have shown mixed results. One reason may be a fairly short duration. Due to higher cost and difficulty with continued compliance from participants, clinical trials tend to be shorter in duration than epidemiological studies. But colorectal cancer can take 7-10 years or longer to develop, during which these trials might not reflect any changes in the colon.
After a review of both cohort and clinical studies by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research, they reported strong evidence that calcium supplements of more than 200 mg daily and intake of high-calcium dairy foods will likely decrease the risk of colorectal cancer. [11] They noted possible causes including the ability of calcium to bind to certain toxic substances in the colon and prevent the growth of tumor cells. Certain bacteria in dairy foods may also be protective against the development of cancerous cells in the colon. [12]
At one time, experts recommended that people with kidney stones limit their calcium intake because the mineral makes up one of the most common types of stones, called calcium-oxalate stones. What we know now is the reverse‚Äîthat not eating enough calcium-rich foods can increase the risk of stone formation. Research from large trials including the Women‚Äôs Health Initiative and the Nurses‚Äô Health Study found that a high intake of calcium foods decreased the risk for kidney stones in women. However the same effect is not true with supplements, as calcium in pill form was found to increase risk. [13,14] A benefit of calcium-rich foods (mainly from dairy) on the prevention of kidney stones was found in a cohort of 45,619 men. Intakes of skim or low-fat milk and cottage cheese or ricotta cheese showed the greatest protective effect. Men who drank two or more 8-ounce glasses of skim milk a day had 42% less risk of developing kidney stones as compared with men who drank less than one glass a month. Eating two or more half-cup servings of cottage cheese or ricotta cheese a week was associated with 30% less risk of kidney stones as compared with men who ate less than one serving a month. It is believed that calcium-rich foods reduce the formation of stones by lowering the absorption of oxalates, which make up calcium-oxalate stones. However, other undetermined components of dairy foods may also be responsible for the decreased risk. [15]
Calcium is widely available* in many foods, not just milk and otherdairy foods. Fruits, leafy greens, beans, nuts, and some starchy vegetables are good sources.
Blood levels of calcium are tightly regulated. Bones will release calcium into the blood if the diet does not provide enough, and no symptoms usually occur. A more serious deficiency of calcium, called hypocalcemia, results from diseases such as kidney failure, surgeries of the digestive tract like gastric bypass, or medications like diuretics that interfere with absorption.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia:
A gradual, progressive calcium deficiency can occur in people who do not get enough dietary calcium in the long-term or who lose the ability to absorb calcium. The first early stage of bone loss is called osteopenia and, if untreated, osteoporosis follows. Examples of people at risk include:
After a diagnosis of osteoporosis, your physician may prescribe over-the-counter calcium supplements. However, there are several points to consider when using calcium supplements.
Too much calcium in the blood is called hypercalcemia. The Upper Limit (UL) for calcium is 2,500 mg daily from food and supplements. People over the age of 50 should not take more than 2,000 mg daily, especially from supplements, as this can increase risk of some conditions like kidney stones, prostate cancer, and constipation. Some research has shown that in certain people, calcium can accumulate in blood vessels with long-term high doses and cause heart problems. Calcium is also a large mineral that can block the absorption of other minerals like iron and zinc.
Symptoms of hypercalcemia:
Certain nutrients and medications may increase your need for calcium because they either lower the absorption of calcium in the gut or cause more calcium to be excreted in the urine. These include: corticosteroids (example: prednisone), excess sodium in the diet, phosphoric acid such as found in dark cola sodas, excess alcohol, and oxalates (seeAre anti-nutrients harmful?).

üîó Riboflavin ‚Äì Vitamin B2
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/riboflavin-vitamin-b2/

Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is naturally present in foods, added to foods, and available as a supplement. Bacteria in the gut can produce small amounts of riboflavin, but not enough to meet dietary needs. Riboflavin is a key component of coenzymes involved with the growth of cells, energy production, and the breakdown of fats, steroids, and medications. [1] Most riboflavin is used immediately and not stored in the body, so excess amounts are excreted in the urine. [2] An excess of dietary riboflavin, usually from supplements, can cause urine to become bright yellow.
RDA:The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for men and women ages 19+ years is 1.3 mg and 1.1 mg daily, respectively. For pregnancy and lactation, the amount increases to 1.4 mg and 1.6 mg daily, respectively.
UL:A Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the maximum daily dose unlikely to cause adverse side effects in the general population. A UL has not been established for riboflavin, because a toxic level has not been observed from food sources or from longer-term intakes of high-dose supplements.
Because riboflavin assists many enzymes with various daily functions throughout the body, a deficiency can lead to health problems. Animal studies show that the brain and heart disorders and some cancers can develop from long-term riboflavin deficiency.
Riboflavin works to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation of nerves, which are contributors to migraine headaches. The vitamin is also needed for normal mitochondrial activities; migraines are sometimes caused by mitochondrial abnormalities in the brain. Therefore riboflavin has been studied as a prophylactic therapy for preventing migraines.
Because some people appear to benefit from the supplements, they are inexpensive, and side effects have been minimal, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that riboflavin is probably effective for preventing migraine headaches and approved its use as a complementary treatment. [5]
Because riboflavin assists many enzymes with various daily functions throughout the body, a deficiency can lead to health problems. Animal studies show that the brain and heart disorders and some cancers can develop from long-term riboflavin deficiency. Riboflavin regulates circulating levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that enters the diet from¬†animal protein foods like meat. High levels in the blood are a risk factor forcardiovascular disease(CVD).¬†Riboflavin works with other B vitamins likeB6,folate, andB12to break down homocysteine in the body.¬†Animal studies show heart abnormalities and increased biomarkers for heart disease in riboflavin-deficient¬†rodents, as well as cardioprotective effects of riboflavin by increasing¬†the¬†production of antioxidant enzymes. [6]¬†However, how riboflavin is regulated and transported in the heart in humans is not clearly understood.¬†Epidemiological studies¬†have not shown that lowering homocysteine levels with B vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of heart attacks or deaths from CVD. [7]¬†The American Heart Association does not advocate for the use of B vitamin supplements for¬†reducing CVD¬†risk. [8]
Riboflavin is found mostly in meat and fortified foods but also in some nuts and green vegetables.
A riboflavin deficiency is very rare in the United States. Disorders of the thyroid can increase the risk of a deficiency. A riboflavin deficiency most often occurs with other nutrient deficiencies, such as in those who are malnourished. Symptoms may include:
Groups at higher risk of deficiency:
A toxic level of riboflavin has not been observed from food sources and supplements. The gut can only absorb a limited amount of riboflavin at one time, and an excess is quickly excreted in the urine. [2] Therefore, a Tolerable Upper Intake Level for riboflavin has not been established.
Ever wonder why you don‚Äôt usually see milk stored in glass bottles anymore? The reason is due to riboflavin. If the vitamin is exposed to too much light, it can be deactivated from its usable form. Therefore milk is now typically sold in cartons or opaque plastic containers to block light.

üîó Diet Review: DASH
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/dash-diet/

Finding yourself confused by the seemingly endless promotion of weight-loss strategies and diet plans?In this series, we take a look at some popular diets‚Äîand review the research behind them.
The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is sometimes prescribed by doctors to help treat high blood pressure. Blood pressure is the amount of pressure that blood places against the walls of arteries. It will normally vary throughout the day but if it remains too high, this is called high blood pressure or hypertension. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and blindness. [1]
DASH was first introduced at a meeting of the American Heart Association in 1996 and later published in theNew England Journal of Medicinein 1997. [2] The DASH trial randomly assigned 456 people to different diets to test the effects of dietary patterns on lowering blood pressure. The authors surmised that eating a diet with many different foods with blood pressure-lowering nutrients would show a greater effect on blood pressure than eating single nutrients, such as found in supplements or in a limited diet. Three diets were tested: 1) a control diet, or a standard American diet, 2) a fruits and vegetables diet, similar to the control diet but providing more fruits and vegetables and less snacks and sweets, and 3) a combination diet rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and low-fat dairy foods with reduced amounts of saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. The last two diets were richer in nutrients associated with lower blood pressure, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, fiber, and protein. All three diets provided about 3000 mg sodium, which is more than the recommended amount from theDietary Guidelines for Americansbut less than the average sodium intake for Americans. [3]
Despite no weight changes, the combination diet reduced blood pressure more than the other two diets. Those with hypertension showed greater decreases in blood pressure than those without hypertension. The reduction of blood pressure in the DASH combination diet was comparable to that of people on medication for stage 1 hypertension.
The results of this landmark study contributed much of the scientific basis for theDietary Guidelines for Americans 2010and later editions.
DASH is based on the following foods:fruits,vegetables, low fat milk,whole grains, fish, poultry,beans, andnuts. It recommends reducingsodium, foods andbeverages with added sugars, and red meat. The diet is heart-friendly as it limitssaturated and trans fat, while increasing the intake ofpotassium,magnesium, calcium,protein, andfiber, nutrients believed to help control blood pressure. [1]
The diet suggests a specific number of servings of the recommended foods listed above. The sample plans provided by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) are based on 1600, 2000, or 2600 calories daily. For 2000 calories a day, this translates to about 6-8 servings of grains or grain products (whole grains recommended), 4-5 servings vegetables, 4-5 fruits, 2-3 low fat dairy foods, 2 or fewer 3-ounce servings of meat, poultry, or fish, 2-3 servings of fats and oils, and 4-5 servings of nuts, seeds, or dry beans per week. It advises limiting sweets and added sugars to 5 servings or less per week. The plan defines the serving sizes of each these food groups.
Eating less carbohydrate but more protein or unsaturated fats may also benefit the heart. The OmniHeart (Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial to Prevent Heart Disease) clinical trial found that swapping out about 10% of calories from carbohydrates with protein (especially plant proteins like legumes, nuts, seeds) or monounsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, nuts, seeds) lowered blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides among adults with early or stage 1 hypertension. [4] Swapping carbohydrates specifically with unsaturated fats also helped to increase ‚Äúgood‚Äù HDL cholesterol. The benefit did not come from simply eating more fats and protein, but swapping an equal amount of calories so that the total calorie level stayed about the same. For 2000 calories a day, this translates to eating daily about 4-5 servings of whole grains, 5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 fruits, 2 low fat dairy foods, one 3-ounce serving of fish, poultry, or meat, and 2-3 servings of unsaturated fats, and eating weekly 7-8 servings of beans, nuts, or seeds.
To follow the plan, one must decide their calorie level and then divide the suggested servings of each food group throughout the day. This requires meal planning ahead of time. The NHLBI guide provides many tips on how to incorporate DASH foods and to lower sodium intake; aone-day sample menufollowing a 2300 mg sodium restriction and a 1500 mg sodium restriction; and one week‚Äôs worth of recipes. The NHLBI also publishes anonline databaseof ‚Äúheart healthy‚Äù recipes.
This sample meal plan is roughly 2000 calories, the recommended intake for an average person. If you have higher calorie needs, you may add an additional snack or two; if you have lower calorie needs, you may remove a snack. If you have more specific nutritional needs or would like assistance in creating additional meal plans, consult with a registered dietitian.
Breakfast:
Snack:¬º cup lightly salted or unsalted nuts
Lunch:
Snack:String cheese, medium apple
Dinner:
Snack:3 ¬Ω cups air-popped popcorn
Numerous studies show wide-ranging health benefits of the DASH diet. A consistent body of research has found that DASH lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure but also normal blood pressure even without lowering sodium intake. [5] It can produce greater reductions in blood pressure if sodium is restricted to less than 2300 mg a day, and even more so with a 1500 mg sodium restriction. [6, 7] When compared with a standard American diet (e.g., high intake of red and processed meats, beverages sweetened with sugar, sweets, refined grains) DASH has also been found to lower serum uric acid levels in people with hyperuricemia, which places them at risk for a painful inflammatory condition called gout. [8] Because people with gout often also have high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases, DASH is optimal in improving all of these conditions.
The DASH diet was found to lower cardiovascular risk in a controlled 8-week trial looking at participants randomized to consume either a DASH diet (low in total/saturated fat with whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts, fruits and vegetables), a fruit and vegetable-rich diet (more fruits/vegetables than control diet but same amount of fat), or control diet (standard American diet high in fat and cholesterol). [9]¬†The researchers estimated a 10-year reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease based on the participants‚Äô blood pressure and cholesterol levels before and after the diet intervention. Participants who ate the DASH or fruit/vegetable diets showed a 10% reduced risk compared with those eating the control diet, but women and Black adults showed the greatest benefits with a 13% and 14% risk reduction, respectively.
Adherence to the DASH-style pattern may also help prevent the development of diabetes, as analyzed in a recent meta-analysis, and kidney disease as found in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort that followed more than 3700 people who developed kidney disease. [10, 11] Dietary components of DASH that were protective in the ARIC cohort included a high intake of nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products. A high intake of red meat and processed meats increased kidney disease risk.
Research supports the use of the DASH diet as a healthy eating pattern that may help to lower blood pressure, and prevent or reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, kidney disease, and gout.

üîó Yogurt
https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/yogurt/

Yogurt is a staple food in several cultures, originating from countries in Western Asia and the Middle East. The word yogurt is believed to be derived from the Turkish word ‚Äúyoƒüurmak,‚Äù which means to thicken, coagulate, or curdle. [1] Historical accounts describe nomadic herdsmen carrying milk in pouches made of animal skins. Naturally occurring enzymes in the pouches that were carried close to the body produced enough body heat to ferment the milk, producing an edible food that lasted longer thanmilk; thus the introduction of yogurt!
Yogurt is made when heated milk is combined with bacteria, specificallyLactobacillus bulgaricusandStreptococcus thermophilus, and left to sit for several hours at a warm temperature (110-115¬∞F). Additional types of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be added. The bacteria convert the sugar in milk, called lactose, to lactic acid, which thickens the milk and develops its distinctive tart flavor.
References to yogurt and health date back to 6000 BCE, as seen in Indian Ayurvedic medicinal texts. In the 1900s, the Bulgarian microbiologist Stamen Grigorov discoveredLactobacillus bulgaricus bacillus, a strain of the bacillus bacteria not naturally found in the human gut that caused the fermentation of yogurt. He also researched the specific health effects of lactic acid.
Today, yogurt can be found in a variety of forms‚Äîincluding plain, but often with added fruit or sweeteners. Thickeners and stabilizers such as gelatin and pectins may also be added for a thicker texture and richer taste.
Individuals with lactose intolerance who cannot toleratedairy productsmay be able to eat some yogurt because of its lower concentration of lactose. Fermentation by the bacteria breaks down lactose to lactic acid. Another option may be plant-based yogurts, which do not contain lactose.
Yogurt offers several important nutrients including protein and calcium. However, much of the research on yogurt‚Äôs health benefits centers on its live bacterial content, which is also present in other fermented foods like kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut. [2] It has been proposed that a lower number of some bacterial strains in the body may influence risk of certain disease conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn‚Äôs disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. [3, 4] A plant-based diet is associated with supporting a diverse and probably healthier gut microbiota more than a diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in meat, [5] and yogurt consumption may also help to increase microbiota diversity in the gut. [6]Learn more about the body‚Äôs microbiome.
Epidemiological research on specific health effects of yogurt is still limited but a few studies suggest a benefit. In a study following three large cohorts for up to 20 years that included 120,877 men and women free of obesity and chronic diseases at baseline, yogurt consumption appeared to protect from weight gain. [7] The authors suggested that changes in colonic bacteria from eating the yogurt may have influenced weight changes. Daily yogurt intake may also protect against heart disease and type 2 diabetes. [8,9]¬†Two meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies found an 18% and 14% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes with daily yogurt intake. [10,11] Why yogurt affects diabetes is unclear, but it is believed that helpful bacteria in the yogurt may reduce inflammation or improve the action of the body‚Äôs natural insulin.
The production of dairy foods places considerable demand on land, water, and other natural resources, and dairy-producing ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats generate methane‚Äîa powerful greenhouse gas. In identifying a dietary pattern both healthy for people and sustainable for the planet, the ‚Äúplanetary health diet‚Äù sets the target for dairy foods at 250 grams per day (with a range of 0 to 500 grams per day), which is about one (8-ounce) cup of yogurt.
Along with fat content, flavor, and type of milk from which the yogurt is derived (cow, goat, etc.), here are some other terms you may find in the yogurt aisle:
If you want to try making strained yogurt at home, it‚Äôs not as difficult as you might think:
